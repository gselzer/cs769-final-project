you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , ta@@ ste it in the bi@@ tter lea@@ ves of plants .
just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still journey beyond the mi@@ lk@@ y way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the buddhi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the bre@@ ath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropolo@@ gy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequ@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our line@@ age made , alb@@ eit success@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ ytes in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the ka@@ i@@ su@@ t desert of north@@ ern ken@@ ya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the and@@ es , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ d@@ entally the fellow that i travel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultur@@ es of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
it &apos;s the symbo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ingly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
and just as the biosphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biologi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ a@@ ches what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
and the great indi@@ c@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules .
a language is a fl@@ ash of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whi@@ sper@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
let &apos;s make it ko@@ g@@ i . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the north@@ west amaz@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sa@@ cre@@ d s@@ na@@ kes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curi@@ ous language and marri@@ age rule which is called &quot; lingu@@ i@@ stic exo@@ gam@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long hou@@ ses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marri@@ age , you never hear anyone practi@@ cing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern e@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ oni@@ shing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 1957 , five mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es attemp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a critical mi@@ sta@@ ke .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the devi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es to death .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mitted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
but at the same time they had a per@@ spi@@ c@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ oni@@ shing .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ oni@@ shing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable fai@@ th of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex me@@ ta@@ physical worl@@ d@@ view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ ani@@ ty , islam , buddhi@@ sm , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
there &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ sumption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ st@@ il@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to moment@@ arily disp@@ l@@ ace the soul of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the god .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ i@@ sts like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you are pos@@ sessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these ast@@ oni@@ shing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ ytes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with imp@@ uni@@ ty , a rather ast@@ oni@@ shing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of extreme exci@@ tation .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the ko@@ g@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ad@@ a de s@@ anta mar@@ ta in north@@ ern col@@ om@@ bia .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars above the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
to this day , they re@@ main ru@@ led by a ritu@@ al pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ ol@@ ytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ est@@ ered in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metaph@@ ori@@ cally in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ smi@@ c -- or we might say the ecolo@@ gi@@ cal -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ yst@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of intui@@ tion becomes very important .
wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ cist in its simpli@@ city , or alterna@@ tively , we in@@ vo@@ ke th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are clo@@ ser to the earth than we are .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are neither sen@@ ti@@ mental nor wea@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gia .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al swa@@ mp@@ s of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intui@@ tion : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s rais@@ ed to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her de@@ stin@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a rais@@ ed to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was rais@@ ed in the forests of british colum@@ bia to believe those forests exi@@ sted to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the north end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to engage during their ha@@ mat@@ sa initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultur@@ es could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the north@@ west amaz@@ on just last a@@ pri@@ l .
this is a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psy@@ cho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
what makes a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharma@@ colo@@ gi@@ cal potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ o@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ridi@@ s .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
in fact , i used to argu@@ e with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexi@@ co in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- i used to argu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a hallu@@ c@@ ination .
but the thing about tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enzy@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tors of the preci@@ se sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when comb@@ ined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
well , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ eties of a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ on@@ omy and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ eties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but somehow redu@@ ced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , mo@@ ves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technological innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either activ@@ ely end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destru@@ ction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultur@@ es through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopp@@ ed being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ gy .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultur@@ es dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynami@@ c living peop@@ les being dri@@ ven out of exist@@ ence by identifi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@ pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been redu@@ ced to ser@@ vi@@ tude and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the si@@ lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese f@@ rei@@ gh@@ ters hang light in the horiz@@ on ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
you know , geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destru@@ ction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strate@@ gy .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once tra@@ v@@ elled 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ a@@ stern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young col@@ lea@@ gue , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sa@@ cre@@ d mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ res during the cultural revolution .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese inv@@ a@@ sion .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ed into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embra@@ ce a pol@@ y@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropolo@@ gist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ fted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ orph@@ ous generi@@ c world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination redu@@ ced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 50,000 &#93; years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we su@@ c@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the seed ; the poe@@ try of the sha@@ man was disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y speci@@ ali@@ zation sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
now , that s@@ hal@@ low history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultur@@ es of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . and there are great moments of opti@@ mis@@ m .
this is a photograph i took at the north@@ ern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grandfather .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 19@@ 50s , to establi@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ ced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man &apos;s grandfather re@@ f@@ used to go .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advan@@ tage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were ori@@ gin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in c@@ ari@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
so , this man &apos;s grandfather was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and defe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
he s@@ kin@@ ned the dog and improvi@@ sed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the dog and improvi@@ sed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbo@@ l of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in a@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ u@@ t .
it &apos;s an independent terri@@ tory . they control all min@@ er@@ al resources .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stitu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote re@@ a@@ ches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ and@@ s of somebody .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dre@@ ams of these children , like the dre@@ ams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geo@@ graphy of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geo@@ graphic , finally , is , we believe that politi@@ cians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not per@@ su@@ a@@ sive , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hi@@ ts on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
our magaz@@ ines are read by millions .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hop@@ efully , therefore , embra@@ ce gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropolo@@ gy : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi@@ cultural , pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our colle@@ ctive well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amo@@ un@@ ts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ ytes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ arran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the libr@@ ary of congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 mega@@ pi@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chapter .
to pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ ent@@ ation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artifi@@ cial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ mend it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an issue of the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
every large image is the beginning of a se@@ ction .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of read@@ ing the real paper version of a magazine or a new@@ spa@@ per , which is an inher@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve made up a fake ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real e@@ state .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but those are all the ro@@ ads in the u.s .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa geo@@ sp@@ ati@@ al image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah s@@ na@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vi@@ sed by steve sei@@ tz at u.@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at microsoft research . a very nice collabor@@ ation .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s power@@ ed by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ resol@@ ution experience .
but the sp@@ ati@@ al arran@@ gement of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
the computer vision al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabi@@ li@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ a@@ mic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environ@@ ments .
there are some that are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
i would like to ju@@ mp straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototy@@ pe of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done enti@@ r@@ ely compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type not@@ re d@@ ame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone cameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , sti@@ tched together in this environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed corre@@ ctly .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire colle@@ ctive memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emergen@@ t that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to stephen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with me@@ ta@@ -@@ data that somebody else ent@@ ered .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that me@@ ta@@ -@@ ver@@ se , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , colle@@ cted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satellite images and so on , but from the colle@@ ctive memory .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically lin@@ k together ?
yes . what this is really doing is discover@@ ing .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in p@@ hr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
thanks so much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will reson@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dres@@ sing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sa@@ mic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on off@@ er suit you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the con@@ su@@ mer electronics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- speak@@ ers , c@@ d player , ta@@ pe player , tun@@ er , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single con@@ su@@ mer electronics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on off@@ er in one store .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communi@@ cations .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never bro@@ ke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , no@@ se hair tri@@ m@@ mer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient auton@@ omy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shi@@ fting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly si@@ ck and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identi@@ ty has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
we don &apos;t inher@@ it an identi@@ ty ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that every@@ day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marri@@ age and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt as@@ sumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ ligen@@ t .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are con@@ sum@@ ing questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hot@@ el .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ fi works .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our la@@ ps .
and even if they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this e@@ mail ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , para@@ do@@ xi@@ cally , is that it produ@@ ces paral@@ ysi@@ s , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ tary reti@@ rement plans .
a col@@ lea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al fund company of about a million emplo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tu@@ al fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of participa@@ tion went down two percent .
you off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer emplo@@ ye@@ es participa@@ te than if you only off@@ er five . why ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row .
and then tom@@ or@@ row , and then tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
by not partici@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
so paral@@ ysi@@ s is a consequ@@ ence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tu@@ al fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dres@@ sing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the paral@@ ysi@@ s and make a choice , we end up less sa@@ tis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad dres@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easi@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you chose .
second , what economi@@ sts call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
dan gi@@ l@@ b@@ ert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to .
well , when there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that you re@@ je@@ ct , that make you less sa@@ tis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ha@@ mp@@ t@@ ons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
gor@@ geous be@@ ach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s au@@ gu@@ st .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these options are going to be refle@@ cted by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re choo@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re choo@@ sing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expe@@ c@@ tations .
this hit me when i went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and wash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
you want button fly or zi@@ pper fly ? you want st@@ one@@ wash@@ ed or aci@@ d-@@ wash@@ ed ?
do you want them di@@ stres@@ sed ?
you want boo@@ t cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , blah blah blah ... &quot; on and on he went .
my ja@@ w dropped , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fi@@ tting je@@ ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expe@@ c@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
i had very low -- i had no particular expe@@ c@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compar@@ ed what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ is@@ on to what i expected .
ad@@ ding options to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expe@@ c@@ tations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expe@@ c@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surpri@@ sed because your expe@@ c@@ tations , my expe@@ c@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expe@@ c@@ tations .
i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t sett@@ le .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , one consequ@@ ence of buying a bad@@ -@@ fi@@ tting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on disp@@ lay , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for fail@@ ure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ ctively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some magi@@ cal amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hur@@ t .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shi@@ fted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
this is what economi@@ sts call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this car@@ to@@ on , and , being a sophi@@ sti@@ cated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
im@@ po@@ veri@@ shed imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paral@@ ysi@@ s .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
you increase paral@@ ysi@@ s , and you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some metaph@@ ori@@ cal fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a reci@@ pe for miser@@ y , and , i su@@ spe@@ ct , disa@@ ster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discover@@ ing new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with desig@@ ning and synthe@@ si@@ zing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many biologi@@ sts have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various appro@@ a@@ ches , par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal components .
we &apos;ve been digi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
this is the map of a small organ@@ ism , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laborat@@ ory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its met@@ abo@@ lic map , it &apos;s rela@@ tively simple compar@@ ed to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthe@@ size this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthe@@ size a chromo@@ some ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boo@@ t up a chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our p@@ ace of digi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al p@@ ace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several sta@@ ges , in fact , starting with a bio@@ ethi@@ cal re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthe@@ si@@ zing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
so we had to create a new meth@@ od for putting these little pieces together and corre@@ ct all the er@@ r@@ ors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kil@@ ls bac@@ teria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error corre@@ ction and had a dna mole@@ cule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bac@@ teria , and the bac@@ teria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . coli .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bac@@ teri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cas@@ sett@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the cas@@ sett@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate .
when we first sequen@@ ced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accu@@ ra@@ cy was one error per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
part of the design is desig@@ ning pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ units we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
some people were disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted there was not poe@@ try .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely ro@@ bu@@ st that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . coli -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ isms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olo@@ g@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organ@@ ism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organ@@ isms that can do this .
these organ@@ isms can be totally desi@@ c@@ cated ; they can live in a v@@ acu@@ um .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the mole@@ cule we built using these process@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ isms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together automatically .
this is not an elec@@ tr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular ph@@ ot@@ omi@@ cro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large mole@@ cule we can see it with a light microscop@@ e .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest mole@@ cule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boo@@ t up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bac@@ teria .
it &apos;s also sim@@ pler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ oning .
with bac@@ teria and ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete tran@@ spl@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophi@@ sti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
there are enzy@@ mes called re@@ stri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the charac@@ teri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genomi@@ c al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gene@@ sis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble feeding , provi@@ ding fres@@ h , clean water , medi@@ cin@@ es , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we try to think of biological process@@ es or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid metho@@ ds of synthe@@ sis , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genomi@@ cs .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosom@@ es a day .
when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze process@@ es to produce o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or to produce pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ ti@@ c@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard sele@@ ction : we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vac@@ cine production , etc .
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els .
you &apos;ve seen recently , corn to e@@ than@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out rela@@ tively soon that are sugar , to much hi@@ g@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limi@@ ting its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cells to go down this road .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 is one meth@@ od ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
this is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have mod@@ est go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vac@@ cine .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spee@@ ding up evolution with synthe@@ tic bac@@ teria , ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilome@@ ters in cir@@ cum@@ ference .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ ti@@ ous .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ ctors .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wide , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
spect@@ acu@@ lar picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
it caused im@@ men@@ se celebra@@ tion in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am parti@@ cle going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great trium@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bi@@ ts of wire here -- these gold wir@@ es .
those wir@@ es carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engine@@ ers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ condu@@ cting wire .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wir@@ es can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufac@@ turing defe@@ ct .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 13@@ ,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electri@@ cal resi@@ stance .
this was the result .
now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fix@@ ed them .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents rei@@ gni@@ te the de@@ ba@@ te about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ aching , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i su@@ spe@@ ct , when de@@ fen@@ ding his prote@@ ge &apos;s u@@ sel@@ ess experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to as@@ sume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteri@@ es in nature , that our trium@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fas@@ c@@ ination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to re@@ c@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly un@@ like any of my previ@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
seri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reaction .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction will kill you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dre@@ ams with your mouth filled with bi@@ tter ash of fail@@ ure ? &quot;
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besi@@ des that people can &apos;t even guess at .
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are sc@@ ary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
you know , is it ra@@ tional ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
you know , and what is it speci@@ fi@@ cally about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t re@@ call once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engine@@ ers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the cent@@ u@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic mani@@ c@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
we wri@@ ters , we kind of do have that repu@@ tation , and not just wri@@ ters , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this repu@@ tation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally com@@ mit su@@ i@@ cide seem to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last inter@@ view , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
an extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ ctively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you com@@ fort@@ able with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ sumption .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encoura@@ ge our great creative minds to live .
and i defini@@ tely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of as@@ sumption , particularly given the cir@@ cum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , so j@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king gin at nine o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refle@@ ction , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct , right ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural anxi@@ ety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of man@@ age the inher@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
people believed that creativity was this di@@ vine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and un@@ know@@ able source , for distant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ vine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
so@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke wisdom to him from a@@ far .
the roman@@ s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of magi@@ cal di@@ vine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ b@@ by the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invi@@ sibly assi@@ st the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ological constru@@ ct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
so the ancient artist was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
if your work bom@@ bed , not enti@@ r@@ ely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and mysteri@@ es , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take di@@ c@@ tation from the di@@ vine .
and it &apos;s the beginning of ra@@ tional human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us rather than having a geni@@ us .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ vine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ tern@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a smi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fragi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expe@@ c@@ tations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative my@@ ster@@ y .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of ra@@ tional humani@@ stic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate scientific su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ons about the notion of , basically fai@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter mad@@ den@@ ing ca@@ pri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had this en@@ coun@@ ter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she grab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
and in these in@@ stances , the po@@ em would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pipeline !
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have bru@@ shed up against that thing , at times .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
and for me , the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , who i got to inter@@ view several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he &apos;s spee@@ ding along , and all of a sudden he he@@ ars this little fra@@ gment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and t@@ ant@@ ali@@ zing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ geous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe recor@@ der .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxi@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and instead of pani@@ cking , he just stopp@@ ed .
he just stopp@@ ed that whole mental process and he did something completely no@@ vel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; ex@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more op@@ port@@ une moment when i can take care of you .
o@@ ther@@ wise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
go bo@@ ther le@@ on@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anxi@@ ety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizar@@ re collabor@@ ation kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite tom .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of pi@@ ts of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disa@@ ster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
but then i re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just li@@ fted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i dire@@ cted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and i would please like the record to refle@@ ct today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sa@@ cre@@ d dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
and they were always ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent , because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
but every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would ali@@ g@@ n .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
he would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from below and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ v@@ ini@@ ty .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know .
curi@@ ous histori@@ cal foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded south@@ ern spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .
in spa@@ in , when a perfor@@ mer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , o@@ le , o@@ le , al@@ la@@ h , ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent , bra@@ vo , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad kne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able source for some ex@@ qui@@ site por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ ghten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psy@@ ched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the di@@ vine , co@@ ck@@ e@@ yed geni@@ us as@@ signed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; o@@ le ! &quot;
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and &quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
o@@ le !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ stra@@ te that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has s@@ hr@@ unk by 40 percent .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
it exp@@ and@@ s in winter and contra@@ cts in summer .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ and@@ s to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it contra@@ cts in summer .
the so-called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ il@@ ling out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by microbes .
compar@@ ed to the total amount of global warming pollu@@ tion in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cro@@ ss this ti@@ pping point .
already in some s@@ hal@@ low la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is activ@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bling up out of the water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another s@@ hal@@ low la@@ ke last winter .
who@@ a !
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in south@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level ri@@ ses from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ a@@ ches the sea .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists reported the entire contin@@ ent is now in negative ice balance .
and west ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly rapid in its mel@@ ting .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
the flo@@ ws have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
this is hi@@ tting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predi@@ ctions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fir@@ es .
and the disa@@ sters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previ@@ ous 75 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pac@@ i@@ fic , from the ameri@@ c@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossi@@ l fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest e@@ mit@@ ters , along with china .
and the pro@@ posal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives pro@@ posed .
however there is a political bat@@ tle in our country .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ dar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image re@@ minded me of something .
around christmas , in my home in ten@@ n@@ es@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around christmas .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christmas was this one .
fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy soul .
he &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting cle@@ aner every@@ day .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
let me be clear about it . al g@@ ore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate prote@@ ction has laun@@ ched two campaig@@ ns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ gy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our pri@@ mary goal to spend a large sum of money on an ad@@ verti@@ sing eff@@ ort to help bring out and compli@@ cate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ ells good , too .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ art clean coal faci@@ lity .
amazing ! the machin@@ er@@ y is kind of l@@ oud .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our addi@@ ction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this mess .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more se@@ cure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
re@@ power america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy gri@@ d .
new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ pa@@ ying jobs .
re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relationships .
sp@@ ati@@ al reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ ti@@ lity of our inter@@ actions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vi@@ ser pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physi@@ cally , arran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building si@@ ft@@ ables .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ ki@@ e .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radio .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by re@@ aching out and gras@@ ping .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fun inter@@ action sty@@ les .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it roll@@ s it back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active por@@ tra@@ its are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surro@@ unded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implications on inter@@ action , we started to realize , was that we could use every@@ day gest@@ ures on data , like po@@ uring a color the way we might po@@ ur a li@@ qu@@ id .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be pain@@ t bu@@ ck@@ ets and i can use them to po@@ ur color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and logi@@ c games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that i &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
basically , in every ro@@ und you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really lo@@ ved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of appli@@ cation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instru@@ ctions .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
that &apos;s our youn@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an inter@@ active car@@ to@@ on appli@@ cation .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually .
and he can bring new charac@@ ters into the scene , just by li@@ fting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
the sun is ri@@ sing .
now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good job ! yeah !
so by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters interact -- wo@@ of !
invent@@ ing his own nar@@ ra@@ tive .
h@@ ello !
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can in@@ je@@ ct these sounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ semble into the pattern that you want .
and you in@@ je@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence si@@ ft@@ able .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
you atta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and then , overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequ@@ ence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now i put a b@@ ass line in .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ ussion in .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequ@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequ@@ ence while it pla@@ ys .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but i can improvi@@ se , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequ@@ ence out using the volume si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laborat@@ ory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you . yes , h@@ ello .
i ’ m happy to be here .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i ’ ll have to provide some back@@ ground information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i ’ d learned theore@@ ti@@ cally into practice .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
so it was curi@@ o@@ sity and i somehow wanted to get clo@@ ser to the material , that was it .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ nolo@@ gy , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like synthe@@ tic biology , etc .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
there are contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al t@@ opi@@ cs such as all those gene@@ ti@@ cally modi@@ fied plants in the fiel@@ ds .
now there ’ s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the usa who ’ s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ di@@ es@@ el fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e .
and then there are things that have already become part of every@@ day life , although most people are not aware of it , such as was@@ hing po@@ w@@ der enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clo@@ th@@ es at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ ti@@ cally opti@@ mis@@ ed enzy@@ mes .
and the list can go on forever .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more .
so what why ha@@ cking ?
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it ’ s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on .
that ’ s rather sad for the ha@@ cker community , because it doesn ’ t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what ’ s behind it .
software ha@@ ck@@ ers started building computers in the se@@ venti@@ es and ei@@ gh@@ ties and this gave rise to the internet .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ ving in a pla@@ yful , creative , original way .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it ’ s also found in the electronics se@@ ctor where you also find a whole tin@@ ker@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of cra@@ zy things with electri@@ cal circu@@ its .
and so now you find it in biology , and i ’ d like to take a metaphor from synthe@@ tic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it ’ s not exactly like a computer , because it ’ s more dynami@@ c , because it ’ s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
but it ’ s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that ’ s it , and i thought think it ’ s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
these these networks didn ’ t really take form until two thousand eight .
there ’ s ha@@ ck@@ teria do@@ t org , which ori@@ gin@@ ally comes from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and it ’ s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it ’ s many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing the knowledge cre@@ ati@@ vely , there are museum ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .
but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it pla@@ y@@ fully .
and then there ’ s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bio@@ - dot@@ -@@ org , di@@ y bi@@ o .
that ’ s a network from the usa , that ’ s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ uss things online .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practi@@ cal questions being asked .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i ’ d like to brie@@ fly describe .
this picture on the left is of bio@@ curi@@ ous , that ’ s a ha@@ cker@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit organi@@ sation institution , where anybody can go to .
children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam@@ ine this in a different kind of way , they ’ ve set up a laborat@@ ory and look at what can be done there , if at laborat@@ ory pro@@ to@@ col@@ s .
here in the bottom left there ’ s a group in in@@ don@@ esi@@ a , house of natural fi@@ bers it ’ s called , but they ’ ve been around for quite some time .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electronic tin@@ k@@ ering , and combine this in a very out@@ lan@@ dish way .
a group from an@@ kar@@ a , that i came into cont@@ act with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organ@@ is@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .
and in this other image at the top i have a le@@ cture in in copenhagen at the medical mu@@ sei@@ on in combin@@ ation with an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion on the topic .
and that ’ s , well that ’ s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really uni@@ tes everybody , is this fas@@ c@@ ination with technology .
and what you can do with it and appro@@ aching society very tar@@ ge@@ ted@@ ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , okay , to ha@@ ck into biology , you need material .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that ’ s a laborat@@ ory .
or what you would normally understand to be a laborat@@ ory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely distant ones , for professional staff , trained academi@@ cs with a doctor ’ s degre@@ e et@@ c. only .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don ’ t actually have to do that .
that ’ s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laborat@@ ory devi@@ ces , that ’ s really true .
and so with this premi@@ ses with this premi@@ ses , brian de@@ gger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laborat@@ ory , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and bre@@ d bac@@ teria with it , working like this .
so anybody who ’ s ever had a sou@@ p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
i then tried to exp@@ and this at my laborat@@ ory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ erni@@ ty test , so dna finger@@ prin@@ ting in other words , at home again .
that ’ s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below you can see there ’ s the laborat@@ ory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a clo@@ sed up garage with all this laborat@@ ory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i ’ d like to brie@@ fly men@@ tion a project .
that here is bio@@ curi@@ ous , the ha@@ cker@@ space i men@@ tioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see that it ’ s a rela@@ tively rela@@ tively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organi@@ sations , who are doing this more form@@ ally in an institu@@ tion@@ ali@@ sed form already .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acc@@ es@@ sible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we ’ re online , and we we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting there and everything .
and then the fo@@ under of do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bi@@ o do@@ t org came and said : okay
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organ@@ is@@ ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ cti@@ ves , our fundamental principles ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu@@ ct .
that was really intui@@ tive , i mean , everyone expres@@ sed their wi@@ shes , their and things that move them .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
and that was then it ’ s not bin@@ ding , but it ’ s yes , i think it has managed to become accep@@ ted quite well , people are quite convin@@ ced about it , yes .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but somehow it wasn ’ t really well received there .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academic world .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teria network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create a so-called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical t@@ wee@@ z@@ ers .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in li@@ qu@@ id and then move them in this focus , so , they ’ re then tra@@ pped in there , so it ’ s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
that really works , it ’ s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might man@@ age that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ tled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has a four hundred fold ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cation appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately .
you can see this at the bottom .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately that didn ’ t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that ’ s pretty cool .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devi@@ ces that measure brain waves , an e@@ e@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum .
visi@@ tors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met .
their brain waves were then meas@@ u@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swi@@ tched on .
was a very a very fan@@ cy project .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with pat@@ erni@@ ty test thing , is the the p@@ c@@ r , the pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ase cha@@ in reaction , a complicated term .
this is about the cop@@ ying of genes , repli@@ cating genes , dna , fra@@ g@@ ments , so that you can make them vi@@ sible .
so when i now that ’ s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this meth@@ od , and then they can say , okay , this hair belon@@ gs to this person , like that .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
and that ’ s not within the range of am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s , but it ’ s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so that ’ s just one appli@@ cation among many that you can use .
and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easi@@ er and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hardware and electronics and they ’ re now the they ’ ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devi@@ ces worl@@ d@@ wide .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it ’ s certainly now it ’ s that ’ s still not cheap , but it ’ s certainly within a range that makes it much more acc@@ es@@ sible .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opinion .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which sho@@ ots about this far , two centi@@ me@@ tr@@ es or so .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that .
so the device you see here didn ’ t work .
but that ’ s my my prototy@@ pe , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing bro@@ ke .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ spen@@ ser and connected it to that .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ spen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to si@@ x@@ ty bar .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ gly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fi@@ f@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , wh@@ ere@@ as whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ spen@@ s@@ ers cost about fi@@ f@@ ty euro@@ s .
so the it ’ s not as effi@@ cient , but it ’ s basically do@@ able .
so that ’ s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sibility , so that that more people can get involved .
because as i said in the beginning , it ’ s an extremely important technology and most people know rela@@ tively little about it and also have no chance of edu@@ cating themselves really well on it .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y literature , that ’ s not the same as when you ’ ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if , as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and this tra@@ des under the names open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core conc@@ ern of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
those are the people who are at least offi@@ cially regi@@ ster@@ ed on the website , the di@@ y-@@ bio@@ -@@ dot@@ -@@ or@@ g-@@ website .
there &apos;s already a rather im@@ pres@@ sive number of people worl@@ d@@ wide .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in south@@ -@@ ea@@ st-@@ asia .
that is i think they are less people have regi@@ ster@@ ed than actually exist .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed .
and they are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , individuals .
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with the ha@@ cker@@ spaces , those places .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five .
and that &apos;s become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent@@ res , which are being repres@@ ented all over the world .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll exp@@ and in a similar way and also be simi@@ lar@@ ly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
and i would like to invi@@ te everyone to work on it and ev@@ ent try something your@@ selves .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curi@@ ous enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
thanks for listening .
that was all .
yes , h@@ ello .
how do we humans actually function ?
this is a question that really mo@@ ves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use inter@@ active media and can come to the most sa@@ tis@@ fying result possible .
i think that inter@@ active media address ar@@ cha@@ ic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were program@@ med into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be eli@@ ci@@ ted through inter@@ active media .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into cont@@ act with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our ar@@ cha@@ ic roots .
so what are ar@@ cha@@ ic models ?
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them brie@@ fly .
ar@@ cha@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to these ar@@ cha@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality .
that might sound unusual at first .
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attempt to pro@@ ve by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that since we because of these ar@@ cha@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
and the third area spe@@ a@@ ks for itself really .
we all know that inter@@ active media is , by definition , non-@@ linear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ g@@ ation of line@@ ari@@ ty , and which of course tells us that we consider line@@ ari@@ ty normal today .
the four@@ th point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i would like to pro@@ ve that to you .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ?
we you wouldn ’ t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are .
that is exactly what you are doing .
you are virtu@@ ali@@ sing the reality without a computer .
fantastic , isn ’ t it ?
at the media cam@@ pu@@ s , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to ren@@ der virtual reality in our virtual reality laborat@@ ory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and this this ability to virtu@@ ali@@ se the virtual reality was something that people in pre-@@ industrial times bi@@ tter@@ ly needed , because they didn ’ t have anything .
they didn ’ t have books , after all .
and they didn ’ t have photo@@ li@@ tho@@ graphy .
they didn ’ t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their mind .
and in this mind they had memory .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and that ’ s why it is so stron@@ gly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short tri@@ p .
yes , that ’ s possible .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produ@@ cer and medi@@ um .
now let ’ s take that a step further .
what is the media today ?
you will notice that a change has taken place .
but i ’ ll come back to that in a moment .
a cru@@ cial tool in information bro@@ ker@@ age has always been stories .
sha@@ man@@ s , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-called kee@@ pers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally as@@ signed to pres@@ er@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very depen@@ dent on stories .
according to the author of the book the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ t@@ sch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the re@@ ception of stories .
that means that once a child has re@@ ached the the the age of legal maj@@ ority , it has spent most of its life recei@@ ving stories .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we s@@ at in the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , that ’ s way off .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-@@ industrial cultur@@ es .
what is particularly im@@ pres@@ sive in the area of inter@@ active media is the fact that we ’ ve an@@ ch@@ ored the ability to think in a non-@@ linear way in our biological memory .
i brought along an example of the north american tribe of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navi@@ gate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and they did this using so-called lead ma@@ ps .
perhaps you ’ ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the au@@ str@@ ali@@ an ab@@ ori@@ gin@@ als .
they have similar principles .
they don ’ t have lead ma@@ ps , but used so-called son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ am@@ pa@@ ths
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ g@@ ation and the to@@ po@@ graphy of regions could be de@@ pi@@ cted through son@@ gs .
and for them language had inf@@ eri@@ or importance .
that means they navi@@ g@@ ated through the use of sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pi@@ cted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graphy of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ fra@@ gment these son@@ gs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
at least not to navi@@ gate .
what what happened there ?
what happened is the the so-called machine age .
before this , we were in the so-called age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ ali@@ sm .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photo@@ li@@ tho@@ graphy .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ tern@@ al media .
to the book and to the image .
the consequ@@ ence of this is that we ’ ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtu@@ ali@@ se .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien to us
and has nothing more to do with reality .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design researcher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@ c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@ ies to stone and have ero@@ ded our ability to virtu@@ ali@@ se .
let ’ s make a short provi@@ sional app@@ ra@@ i@@ sal .
from the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ ali@@ sm to the to the machine age .
what has an influ@@ ence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
those are the de@@ clin@@ ing influ@@ ences of the pre-@@ industrial cultur@@ es .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
that means that instead of having individual memor@@ ies , we have standar@@ dis@@ ed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memor@@ ies , onto which we can atta@@ ch our personal memor@@ ies .
we no longer produce .
we have an abstract an abstra@@ cted language .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but co@@ di@@ fy them through language .
we ’ ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion .
and we ’ ve accep@@ ted line@@ ari@@ ty as the law and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , such as non-@@ line@@ ari@@ ty .
what ’ s left is story@@ telling .
we ’ re still extremely atta@@ ched to story@@ telling as a meth@@ od of information bro@@ ker@@ age .
the question is , what will come next ?
we had the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ ali@@ sm , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so-called cy@@ ber age .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fi@@ ction , i know .
but the concepts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non-@@ line@@ ari@@ ty , about story@@ telling .
i ’ d like to explain that a little more .
there are technical concepts such as “ au@@ g@@ mented reality ” .
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that ’ s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff@@ ini@@ ty for virtu@@ ali@@ sation , of experi@@ en@@ cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addres@@ sed again .
another example is so-called virtual reality as cra@@ zy as that may of course sound in the context of my present@@ ation , we are physi@@ cally moving in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual worl@@ ds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ently .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or ’ s projects by michael bur@@ k , an@@ n@@ -@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ enz , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er .
the last two men@@ tioned are also present today .
perhaps you could just brie@@ fly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
i brought this project along as an example to illu@@ stra@@ te how these ar@@ cha@@ ic , cognitive models are being addres@@ sed again .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es for story@@ telling , and it ’ s a computer game .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of person@@ s people jump@@ ing around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ so@@ le .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
this is a game for outside .
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to en@@ able me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i ’ m sorry i have to keep this so short .
you can explain this much more el@@ abor@@ ately later on , as there ’ s more much more to this .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been men@@ tioned posi@@ tively or ne@@ ga@@ tively on twitter .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different im@@ pression , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can take a look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explan@@ ation of what we ’ re about to see .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that ’ s obvious .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds vi@@ sible .
right , i ’ d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my present@@ ation by stat@@ ing that the charac@@ teri@@ stics and abilities that we ac@@ qui@@ red during the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ ali@@ sm , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be re@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the so-called cy@@ ber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
i was just asked whether this sa@@ ck is a talking sa@@ ck and will talk for me .
it won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the su@@ spen@@ se .
yes , children are or should be natur@@ ally curi@@ ous , and so are designers .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ o@@ sity and how curi@@ o@@ sity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ o@@ sity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besi@@ des your exist@@ ence as a designer .
when profess@@ ors become curi@@ ous , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the topic natural user interface design .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with such natural , ar@@ cha@@ ic prototy@@ pes of communication , inter@@ action , etc .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devi@@ ces , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
and against that back@@ ground , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the inter@@ action between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has su@@ c@@ c@@ essi@@ vely transformed itself from a calcul@@ ator to a digital assi@@ stant .
so i looked into when things are natural and intui@@ tive .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed brie@@ fly here , we are moving from the third to the four@@ th social generation , or social form .
from the modern to the computer society .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by one pri@@ mary medi@@ um .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ b@@ al society , charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by language .
that means people related to each other because they spo@@ ke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
but the pri@@ mary medi@@ um was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can natur@@ ally talk , but we learn it su@@ c@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and rela@@ tively natur@@ ally .
that was then re@@ plac@@ ed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstra@@ ction .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest itself in writing , meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so manipu@@ late it .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compar@@ ed to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the pri@@ mary medi@@ um , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ oth@@ old .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at .
that &apos;s the medi@@ um of print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ g@@ y@@ men and others said : have you gone ma@@ d , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it .
of course it totally con@@ f@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that clas@@ h@@ es with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the las@@ ag@@ ne and not be@@ ef or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not con@@ f@@ ess to it .
and these two worl@@ ds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechan@@ isms , principles and ar@@ cha@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the the@@ me of ecolo@@ gy is a global the@@ me .
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also with complete transpar@@ ency .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with who@@ m and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devi@@ ces on a global level .
we &apos;re accu@@ mul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re accu@@ mul@@ ating it increasingly qui@@ cker and better , for example .
just like it used to happen in the village .
against that back@@ ground i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friend@@ ly , so that anybody can use it ?
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be improved too .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influ@@ ence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of per@@ ception and per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al psych@@ ology .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of per@@ ception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ?
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig de@@ e@@ per to understand how it works .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundam@@ entally .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven offi@@ cially recogni@@ sed senses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be ad@@ ded to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .
and to see how we process information , how do we ab@@ sor@@ b information ?
and just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intui@@ tive or natur@@ ally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible .
and of course how design affe@@ cts per@@ ception .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a con@@ f@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pper , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so a lot more natur@@ ally , and though they &apos;re in a con@@ tain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains s@@ alt and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pper .
and if i say to someone , pass me the s@@ alt or the pe@@ pper , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the s@@ alt , as it hop@@ efully won &apos;t be sugar .
but our per@@ ception , how it de@@ cei@@ ves us too .
for example per@@ ception in this context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our per@@ ception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recogni@@ tion should also work .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate a certain simi@@ l@@ ari@@ ty .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
this is called a law of design or gest@@ alt psych@@ ology , which in turn affe@@ cts our per@@ ception .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great la@@ ws of design .
the law of pro@@ xi@@ mi@@ ty , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
that might sound mun@@ dan@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a clo@@ ser look at it .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
that &apos;s wrong .
first you see from back to front .
because you project an as@@ sumption that you &apos;re seeing something you recogni@@ se to the front , such as a circle .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
i have this cognitive feed@@ back , you proje@@ cted something you want to see .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequ@@ ence of certain things is and the sp@@ an of milli@@ seconds in which these things happen .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
the same thing that i just descri@@ bed is now happening .
everybody is now trying to recogni@@ se something in this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ ses what .
does anyone see anything specific ?
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an , exactly .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an in this , you know it .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an is .
now you see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feed@@ back , seeing .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an to the front .
then i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
so these are really exciting process@@ es , which take place ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted area .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
a long time , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds .
he will have to process that as the present .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegan@@ t way , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five milli@@ seconds ?
yes , milli@@ seconds .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and si@@ x@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
that means the first im@@ pression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we per@@ cei@@ ve things .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ingly .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the topic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ es or cognitive er@@ gon@@ omi@@ cs , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
on the one hand there are the practi@@ cal functions in terms of product language , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal a@@ esthe@@ tic aspe@@ cts .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator functions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
but there are also symbo@@ lic functions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous su@@ ms of money on such a little bag that you can har@@ dly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practi@@ cal ?
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , effi@@ cient and sa@@ tis@@ fying way possible .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something as user friend@@ ly as possible ?
can i hand@@ le it directly or do i need a manu@@ al or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training .
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly .
making it differently or pret@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easi@@ er to use .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an elem@@ entary economic fac@@ tor , an elem@@ entary success fac@@ tor , when apple appeared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devi@@ ces us@@ able for people .
why ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in effici@@ ency , to man@@ age to do certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to hand@@ le these systems .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ omi@@ sts say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
that made the whole thing consider@@ ably more user friend@@ ly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the next generation of graphic user inter@@ faces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance .
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an appli@@ cation .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intui@@ tive ?
if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to r@@ ough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ omi@@ cs , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intui@@ tive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things rela@@ tively simple for themselves .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consider@@ ably more user friend@@ ly .
that pos@@ es the question as to what is actually the most intui@@ tive performance sch@@ e@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
it &apos;s the so-called o@@ sit model .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , transa@@ ct .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ ctively in part .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it functions worl@@ d@@ wide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
o@@ sit in itself is used by us fi@@ f@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ cer@@ ta@@ ined that when you sle@@ ep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , transa@@ ct to an inter@@ action system .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the one of the des@@ k@@ top .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let ori@@ ent take shape as an over@@ view , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , in@@ form in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , transa@@ ct means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ opp@@ ing , etc . ,
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in .
i get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consider@@ ably more intui@@ tive and natural .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consider@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acc@@ es@@ sible via hierarchi@@ cally organ@@ is@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechan@@ isms so to speak .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sent@@ ence a and again give the ad@@ vi@@ ce that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
i &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to a particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ o@@ sity .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your po@@ t@@ ty and sti@@ r its cont@@ ents , your curi@@ o@@ sity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
and curi@@ o@@ sity can &apos;t be learned .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a charac@@ teri@@ stic that can &apos;t be learned .
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , for@@ ty years of the@@ -@@ clu@@ b-@@ o@@ f-@@ ro@@ me , into quality .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
give pe@@ e a chance .
every day you rele@@ ase + you rele@@ ase in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to ab@@ sor@@ b two grams of phosphorus .
o@@ ther@@ wise you couldn &apos;t have te@@ eth .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in the earth &apos;s se@@ as as am@@ orph@@ ous m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t ab@@ sor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosphorus .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we are depen@@ dent on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worl@@ d@@ wide is already e@@ mi@@ tting a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last tw@@ enty years alone , fi@@ f@@ te@@ en thousand ton@@ nes of ur@@ ani@@ um was put onto our fiel@@ ds in ger@@ many .
and we ab@@ sor@@ b all of it .
it causes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
protect the environment , produce less ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh .
protect the environment , con@@ sume less energy .
but that &apos;s not prote@@ ction .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it &apos;s just a little less destru@@ ction .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ d@@ le to the gra@@ ve , then our our entire planet will become a ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y so@@ on@@ er or later .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the ground stores over si@@ x@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
at the moment we &apos;re growing corn and losing between el@@ even and thir@@ ty kilo@@ grams thir@@ ty ton@@ nes per he@@ ct@@ are , if you were to calcu@@ late it per square met@@ re .
that means we &apos;re losing fi@@ ve-@@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and everything is either the packa@@ ging or the cont@@ ents .
in offen@@ ba@@ ch , for example , tw@@ enty percent of the amount of waste produced by hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds consi@@ sts of na@@ pp@@ ies .
and as we get older , the na@@ pp@@ ies get bigger .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-@@ na@@ pp@@ y stage , so to speak .
right ?
one a baby needs about si@@ x-@@ thousand na@@ pp@@ ies .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
china can make up for that in one second .
it &apos;s enti@@ r@@ ely in@@ significant .
so the question is , how should we deal with na@@ pp@@ ies ?
here we have a the pro@@ of , by the way , that humans are not pi@@ gs .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
because with pi@@ gs , phosphorus is released in their soli@@ d components fa@@ e@@ ces .
with people , it is released in the ur@@ ine .
yes .
so humans can &apos;t be pi@@ gs .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
tradi@@ tion@@ ally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their exist@@ ence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so you have someone like al g@@ ore , one of our great hero@@ es , saying : there is nothing more important than stabi@@ li@@ sing the human population .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants wei@@ gh four times as much a people .
i could also men@@ tion ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the usa nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
so ants wei@@ gh more than we do .
and because they work so much har@@ der physi@@ cally than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amo@@ un@@ ts to that of thir@@ ty billion people .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen@@ ba@@ ch , for example , has a program to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l by tw@@ enty for@@ ty , right ?
you can only be climate neu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
that &apos;s your only chance .
have you ever seen a climate neu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
have you ?
just one single one ?
that means our entire intelligence amo@@ un@@ ts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you see ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
than@@ k@@ fully , right ?
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amaz@@ on forest alone .
of those have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
so all of our intelligence amo@@ un@@ ts to us wanting to be du@@ mber than trees .
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ ct@@ est organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own met@@ abo@@ lic waste to be returned .
every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosphorus , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated .
and so there are too many of us .
just because of that .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no nat@@ u@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mi@@ ts our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
but where are we of use ?
we try to mini@@ mi@@ ze our ecolo@@ gi@@ cal footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that &apos;s of use .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
zero emissions , you see ?
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents .
with the agriculture we practice in brazi@@ l in which we win back nutri@@ ents .
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
in in china a a cham@@ ber pot is still called a hon@@ ey pot , you could say , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is charac@@ teri@@ zed by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places .
that &apos;s why all western em@@ pi@@ res just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until they couldn &apos;t man@@ age the infrastructure any@@ more and then they imp@@ lo@@ ded .
you see ?
it was different in china .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents .
even today , if you get invi@@ ted to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me@@ al until you need to use the toilet .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you .
you were you were invi@@ ted to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bio@@ gas , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a far@@ mer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ gs and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over n@@ ine@@ ty percent .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
that &apos;s high-@@ tech agriculture of course , but the pl@@ ots take care of themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a far@@ mer can farm them easily .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and none of these pl@@ ots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fi@@ f@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ enty years , none of these pl@@ ots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ t@@ re of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in ger@@ many the most su@@ it@@ able pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ cation plant is the one in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t .
unfortunately not the one on offen@@ ba@@ ch , but perhaps you can give the fran@@ k@@ fur@@ ters a hand .
because the plant in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t would be the best at w@@ inning back phosphorus .
and it must go back .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see that it can be done .
in holl@@ and we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worl@@ d@@ wide to win back phosphorus .
but we need this everywhere .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosphorus reser@@ vo@@ irs worl@@ d@@ wide .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c , a a bunch of am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s .
it consi@@ sts of tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six member countries that control for@@ ty percent of all the oil de@@ posi@@ ts .
and oil will be able to be re@@ plac@@ ed by other energy sources .
but phosphorus will not be able to be re@@ plac@@ ed .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
so it &apos;s about effe@@ ctivity , not effici@@ ency .
in holl@@ and it &apos;s easi@@ er to understand this , because holl@@ and built the country on flo@@ wers .
you see ?
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up@@ set her , and you turn up with fi@@ f@@ ty ro@@ ses .
totally in@@ effi@@ cient .
but totally effective , right ?
or take li@@ p@@ stick .
a woman in ger@@ many s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws about six point three ki@@ los of li@@ p@@ stick in her life@@ time .
wh@@ ere@@ as .
and that scienti@@ fi@@ cally speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly corre@@ ct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li@@ p@@ stick is totally in@@ effi@@ cient , but very effective , you see ?
a all the beautiful things in life are in@@ effi@@ cient .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource effici@@ ency , but effe@@ ctivity .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cycles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ el@@ f , how do you close cycles ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art being effi@@ cient .
right ?
if i invi@@ te you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a p@@ ill with offen@@ ba@@ ch ta@@ ste and a glass of water to go with it .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s effi@@ cient .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not effi@@ cient .
when you fall in love with someone , effi@@ cient ?
yes ?
that means that everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding , redu@@ cing .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environ@@ ment@@ ally aware .
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a north@@ ern perspective .
every footprint is disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ geous there .
when you go running , right , every footprint destro@@ ys the ground .
because the soil will the mo@@ ss dies and the the wind and water was@@ h away the soil .
but if you &apos;re in i@@ tal@@ y , every footprint means the water will re@@ main in the field for longer .
so it &apos;s about lea@@ ving lea@@ ving a large footprint , which will turn into we@@ t@@ land .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
we say sustain@@ ability in ger@@ many .
right ?
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
what would you say ?
sustainable .
then i would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
that &apos;s just about the minim@@ um .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding .
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in i@@ tal@@ y throw out a can of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a from their car window .
that &apos;s a funny oc@@ curr@@ ence , you know .
it &apos;s a type of terri@@ t@@ ori@@ al behavior , right ?
you can show that you were there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns into li@@ qu@@ id at room temper@@ ature .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ degra@@ ded , wh@@ er@@ ever it is .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of r@@ are plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contribu@@ ting to bio@@ diversity .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not har@@ m@@ ful .
so two cycles are created .
of course not everything should be com@@ post@@ able .
a tv or a was@@ hing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
only things that are subject to wear and te@@ ar , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , bra@@ ke cover@@ ings , car ty@@ res , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
right ?
let &apos;s take s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers for example , right ?
direct ad@@ verti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to help this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
right ?
so if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , this is free of chi@@ cken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
posi@@ tively .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it .
everything that &apos;s inside can be u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed .
these are the first shoes with which you make a j@@ ac@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit start at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an lights and the ru@@ b@@ ber so@@ le can go into biological cycles , okay ?
it &apos;s all com@@ post@@ able all of it .
and if we man@@ age to do it , we &apos;ll of course man@@ age to do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole texti@@ le industry .
and half of the wa@@ ste@@ water problem worl@@ d@@ wide is caused by the texti@@ le industry .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you are you really serious ?
because they changed their cha@@ ir@@ man of the board of dire@@ ctors twice now .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
so give me a hand here .
it is possible though .
yes .
that which i just pres@@ ented to you .
it &apos;s possible .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and te@@ ar , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles .
there are also technical cycles .
there &apos;s the a direct re@@ turning system for this .
it &apos;s the first biological ru@@ ck@@ sa@@ ck , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
if you think about it , right ?
remember those na@@ pp@@ ies again ?
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
these na@@ pp@@ ies are everywhere practi@@ cally .
in those countries where people have money .
they &apos;re on the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh ti@@ ps , but also el@@ se@@ where in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water t@@ ank , inside , so they can go back to a cellu@@ lose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fi@@ f@@ ty trees in israel or t@@ uni@@ sia with one baby .
right ?
if you just take these these na@@ pp@@ ies , sh@@ red them , steri@@ li@@ ze them and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees with it .
that makes the baby carbon@@ -@@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ positive .
it &apos;s about making a benefi@@ cial po@@ op print .
yes , so to speak .
right ?
we can do that .
we can re-@@ inv@@ ent things all over again .
i fo@@ unded an institute with this in mind .
today , it has many emplo@@ ye@@ es and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s also an extra associ@@ ation , the cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ le-@@ institute , where everybody can get involved .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding , redu@@ cing , no more gu@@ il@@ t management , but intelligent waste .
does that make you curi@@ ous ?
thank you .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
music as language .
in the descri@@ ption of my present@@ ation , it is written that i , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a transl@@ ator , in the english sense of the word .
interpre@@ ters are transl@@ ators of the written notes in res@@ o@@ unding music .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl@@ ator can ’ t just simply ren@@ der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the de@@ e@@ per meaning of the words and the context in which they appe@@ ar , so that a mean@@ ing@@ ful trans@@ lation can occur .
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can already dem@@ and more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it ’ s the trans@@ lation of literature or even poe@@ try .
what we musi@@ cians do with our musi@@ cal language is very alien to non-@@ profession@@ als .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music i only have the musi@@ cal notes at first .
now you probably think that the com@@ pos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they ’ ve thought of .
in reality the notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ preci@@ se .
these notes are about as preci@@ se or im@@ preci@@ se as the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely preci@@ se .
because you can ’ t smell the flo@@ wers in the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , you can ’ t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can ’ t hear or feel the whi@@ sp@@ ering of the wind .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must translate these im@@ preci@@ se indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al musi@@ cal language .
today i ’ d like to verb@@ ally translate what i usually translate into music , or interpre@@ t .
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation .
that ’ s why i pre@@ fer to do it all in ger@@ man , because if i ’ d have to translate it into english , that would be like the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
the so , music functions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opinion .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
so it ’ s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a vi@@ oli@@ n str@@ ing .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don ’ t recogni@@ ze the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musi@@ cal language as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it pas@@ si@@ vely or whether you can also activ@@ ely speak it , all the way to the musi@@ cal native speaker .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
once you ’ ve sele@@ cted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the back@@ ground of the com@@ position ’ s cre@@ ation .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dar@@ y literature .
you read letters , di@@ ari@@ es , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expres@@ sed by the com@@ pos@@ er themselves .
you study works that have been com@@ posed before or after .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
the reasons for writing it .
how and what did they feel ?
what were their life cir@@ cum@@ stances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
all that interests me .
you imagine the time by looking at images or read@@ ing literature from that period .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surro@@ unding the com@@ pos@@ er as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easi@@ er and easi@@ er to understand and feel with the com@@ pos@@ er .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you ’ re living with .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
as the note is anything but a preci@@ se indi@@ cation of the desire of a com@@ pos@@ er , and is , rather , a fra@@ me@@ work , i will now u@@ ti@@ li@@ se this fra@@ me@@ work to fill it with sense and meaning .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this fra@@ me@@ work .
i play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the com@@ pos@@ er at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
every note , every p@@ hrase is thus given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i ’ ve personally experienced .
it has to make sense in the here and now , o@@ ther@@ wise i won ’ t convin@@ ce my audience that this is my desire .
it always makes for a happy conc@@ ert when i have the fortun@@ e to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though i ’ ve been working on it for so long in ad@@ v@@ ance .
it ’ s like experi@@ en@@ cing a happy new day af@@ res@@ h , even though you go through the same ritu@@ als , getting up , having break@@ fast , going to work , i experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
i ’ m a day older , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se is slo@@ wer in the ev@@ ening than it is in the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall it takes longer for the rever@@ ber@@ ation to return than it does at home .
i ’ m aware of the breathing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all this influ@@ ences me and influ@@ ences my experience of the com@@ position .
it ’ s also really wonderful when i ’ m on stage with my musi@@ cal other half and we ’ re on the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , sti@@ mul@@ ating conversation .
you introdu@@ ce a new idea and this is answered inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with a reaction .
it ’ s exciting , because things happen that we didn ’ t practice and we aren ’ t able to practice .
it ’ s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communi@@ c@@ ates in a li@@ vely way .
in this way , every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
i won ’ t be able to play like i do today in tw@@ enty years .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musi@@ cal pal@@ ette will have many more nu@@ an@@ ces of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
sure , i will have thro@@ wn some colors away too , but i will have ad@@ ded new ones to take their place .
i have a nice , con@@ cre@@ te example to illu@@ stra@@ te this .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my belo@@ ved old teacher professor j@@ ü@@ r@@ gen u@@ de , a well-@@ known be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pi@@ an@@ ist and lon@@ g@@ standing professor at the conser@@ v@@ at@@ ory here in stu@@ tt@@ g@@ art .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir@@ te@@ en , and so i always atten@@ ded his courses while i was at school .
i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in ’ s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works .
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this bal@@ la@@ d was in my opinion .
it ’ s a so@@ le@@ m@@ n part .
and , being young , i said , expe@@ c@@ tation .
he smi@@ led and said , oh ?
that must be our difference in age .
because to me it means memory .
he was over si@@ x@@ ty at the time .
well , at se@@ vent@@ e@@ en you still have dre@@ ams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
today , i play this piece every few years and it ’ s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
it ’ s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
another example from a very different field . mon@@ et pain@@ ted his wat@@ er@@ li@@ lies an infinite number of times .
it ’ s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
he transl@@ ated the wat@@ er@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
his personal im@@ pres@@ sions of the wat@@ er@@ li@@ lies .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the um@@ pte@@ ent@@ h time is compar@@ able in this way .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in when he wrote the piece at thir@@ ty-@@ two .
he only lived until the age of thir@@ ty-@@ nine .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
to main@@ tain the dialo@@ gue , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
usually you first learn to read notes in music les@@ sons .
you practi@@ cally first learn to read before you speak an a word .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
when you then move all your fing@@ ers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music .
once it &apos;s played free of mi@@ stakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly har@@ der .
beginn@@ ers &apos; classes har@@ dly talk about interpre@@ tation .
well , so it says pre@@ st@@ o at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
len@@ to , slow .
the l@@ oud and soft symb@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
most people here have heard of them .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just rema@@ ins something technical .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpre@@ tation .
i &apos;m surpri@@ sed .
i &apos;m surpri@@ sed that people often forget something very elem@@ entary .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musi@@ cal action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance .
which is singing .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it reson@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
people who have never s@@ un@@ g consequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one .
to form a p@@ hrase with one &apos;s own bre@@ ath .
the music instrument is an exten@@ sion of our own body .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fing@@ ers .
the mel@@ o@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being s@@ un@@ g and rhyth@@ m is created through dance .
the con@@ stant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very benefi@@ cial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bor@@ ed .
you no longer need to whi@@ stle or sing a song .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use these little mu@@ sc@@ les that att@@ une the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds .
because you can train that .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ it@@ able .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so ni@@ c@@ ely no@@ wa@@ days ?
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
which i would very much re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a lo@@ vely , communi@@ ca@@ tive thing .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the ta@@ ste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ sta@@ in from food just because you can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ sta@@ in from listening to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether you like its ta@@ ste or not .
whether the music is too pep@@ per@@ y or sweet for your ta@@ ste .
say what you feel .
with time , you will have dem@@ and@@ s and will want to have more spi@@ ces in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
why do i dem@@ and from my audience that they listen activ@@ ely ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
a work of art that is never looked at will never ga@@ ther the strength to have an effect .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a co@@ ok , not just look at it or pass on the reci@@ pe for it .
so please listen when music is played .
it is not only a nice wall@@ paper made of noise .
when a child gro@@ ws up in an environment where the adul@@ ts activ@@ ely make music or at least activ@@ ely li@@ stens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and it will sound completely different from before .
that would be the very beginning of their own musi@@ cal expression .
so the first step towards an interpre@@ tation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was ori@@ gin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
instru@@ ments have developed .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as the piano in ba@@ ch &apos;s time .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
i think ba@@ ch would have been very enthusi@@ a@@ stic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pi@@ an@@ os have .
i can make ba@@ ch &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a bar@@ o@@ que har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ ord was not able to .
of be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven we know that he listen@@ ed more once he &apos;d already gone dea@@ f .
today a modern orchestra can play anything that was re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ pla@@ y@@ able at the time .
that &apos;s why com@@ pos@@ ers depend on us interpre@@ ters to rein@@ vent the pieces again and again .
so that what they had only con@@ ju@@ red up in their minds becomes listen@@ able .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what en@@ vy is ?
were you ever en@@ vi@@ ous ?
and how did you feel ?
terrible .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
when i turn up in my little v@@ w cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
something sho@@ ots through my head .
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s un@@ fair .
it goes against justice .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
our organ@@ ism has come up with an ex@@ cell@@ ent meth@@ od to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappear .
you can also try it with words like reven@@ ge or ac@@ qui@@ si@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and the like .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acc@@ es@@ sible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall .
and then they start pil@@ ing up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something enti@@ r@@ ely different in mind .
he &apos;s only de@@ cei@@ ving you and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re de@@ cei@@ ving yourself .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self-@@ de@@ ception , up@@ right .
this is har@@ der to check or bring down .
you need time .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know talks about this time .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pi@@ cas@@ so once pain@@ ted a por@@ tra@@ it of a woman .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the por@@ tra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her .
pi@@ cas@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
it will start to look more and more like you .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recogni@@ ze how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mi@@ r@@ ror .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ di@@ o@@ se inven@@ tion to stabi@@ li@@ ze our living conditions .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories .
perhaps you know this idea of the la@@ dy who looked at her@@ self in the mi@@ r@@ ror every day and said , who is the fai@@ rest of them all ?
one day this mi@@ r@@ ror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you .
over the hi@@ ll@@ s and all that .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ lity ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mi@@ r@@ ror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political corre@@ ct@@ ness here .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bi@@ shop of wor@@ ce@@ ster .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the ori@@ gin of species and the des@@ cent of man .
that humans are supposed to have des@@ cen@@ ded from apes and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ stor shared by both humans and apes .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true .
that the human des@@ cen@@ ded from apes and we have a shared ance@@ stor .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
because we want this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , des@@ cen@@ ded from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predict@@ able as an organ@@ ism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that ’ s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
so we can ’ t be@@ ar these things .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they ’ re true .
to show you how slowly this mechan@@ ism disappe@@ ars and to illu@@ stra@@ te the tra@@ ces it lea@@ ves , which lead to something other than this gran@@ di@@ o@@ se image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
my wife told me it .
one day she came back from her school , she ’ s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the ten@@ den@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and then he said , well , i ’ m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
and because i ’ m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i ’ m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
yes , you ’ ll sense it if you ’ re feeling a little ner@@ v@@ ous at this point , something is not quite right .
i told my wife , wh@@ en@@ ever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to re@@ place it with the word although .
you do this and then you ’ ll see the sent@@ ence , although i ’ m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i ’ m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sent@@ ence .
a young la@@ d like that , he ’ s not interested in putting out fir@@ es .
he ’ s interested in setting fir@@ es .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
there ’ s only the second best op@@ tion , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
that ’ s where he signed up .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don ’ t tell your teacher that you like to set fir@@ es and are happy when the fire fl@@ ar@@ es up .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we ’ re responsible for re@@ moving the dan@@ ger that others create when they set a fire .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can ’ t say that out l@@ oud .
here you have the cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which swi@@ t@@ ches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political corre@@ ct@@ ness .
we know that something else is really true .
but we know that if we were to say that out l@@ oud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively di@@ stur@@ bed .
we can ’ t just do that .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
i ’ d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
according to which logi@@ c do we dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present a reality that ’ s different from the reality we know is v@@ ali@@ d in our un@@ conscious minds ?
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illu@@ stra@@ te this .
the first example works with the pres@@ um@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don ’ t need at all .
i ’ m talking about the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something mental , lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convin@@ ced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an in@@ corpo@@ real fra@@ me@@ work around you , and it ’ s not material , and you are just made of fl@@ es@@ h and blood , are soli@@ d , so to speak , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to de@@ ca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an air@@ y nature , it ’ s called anim@@ a in la@@ tin , being like a bre@@ ath of air .
and when this bre@@ ath of air po@@ ur@@ s out onto a human , the human is filled with di@@ gni@@ ty , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul .
and then it can leave you .
that ’ s how people imagine the soul works .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and if you think of this condi@@ tion , then you ’ ll understand the logi@@ c behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three .
you ’ ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a logi@@ c to us .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my present@@ ation .
you ’ ll need some logi@@ c here , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
nam@@ ely to lie in such a way that you can simply imple@@ ment this logi@@ c in the wrong way .
this rule of three con@@ tains three the@@ or@@ em@@ s .
the first the@@ or@@ em is , kl@@ au@@ s cla@@ im@@ s there is no soul .
the second the@@ or@@ em is thus , if kl@@ au@@ s is right , then he doesn ’ t have a soul .
now we have the third the@@ or@@ em .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
a third the@@ or@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to the idea of a soul .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can ’ t cla@@ im anything .
so you sense it already .
here this logi@@ c is expres@@ sed in this de@@ cep@@ tive disc@@ our@@ se .
you see it straight away .
the first two the@@ or@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally corre@@ ct .
i can cla@@ im anything .
logi@@ c does not make any stat@@ ements about reality .
i can say , the ger@@ man chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
and if i ’ m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
if i ’ m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man .
logi@@ c does not make any stat@@ ement about what is v@@ ali@@ d .
i can cla@@ im anything .
what is deci@@ sive , if i ’ m right , then it ’ s v@@ ali@@ d .
so when kl@@ au@@ s says , there is no soul .
secon@@ dly , if he ’ s right , then he doesn ’ t have a soul .
these things are logi@@ cally corre@@ ct .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
so it atta@@ ches a third the@@ or@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two the@@ or@@ em@@ s and only acts as if the opposite of the first the@@ or@@ em had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority .
because we ’ d really have to pro@@ ve whether the soul exists or not .
but with this logi@@ c , which just uses the fact that two the@@ or@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally corre@@ ct and atta@@ ches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul .
and we ’ re very happy about it .
we can apply these things to other examples .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly an i@@ te@@ m in the da@@ ily new@@ spa@@ pers .
here you have to keep another philosophi@@ cal the@@ me , a philosophi@@ cal slo@@ w-@@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ te@@ ent@@ h
century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan ’ s ass was named after him .
bu@@ ri@@ dan ’ s ass is an ass that is made pur@@ ely of nature .
it doesn ’ t have this soul .
it ’ s a natural thing .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ yst@@ ac@@ ks , it will star@@ ve .
because it doesn ’ t know which ha@@ yst@@ ack it should go to first .
so it ’ s right in the middle .
that ’ s how things of nature are imag@@ ined .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ nat@@ ures will can@@ c@@ el each other out .
nothing will happen .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ yst@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn ’ t need any sense or anything else .
he ’ ll automatically go to the right thought .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow dri@@ ven , determined by the larger ha@@ yst@@ ack that immediately attra@@ cts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we ’ re here in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t am main , i ’ ll remind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research .
there ’ s a sch@@ ol@@ ar there , his name is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes people say , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ im@@ s , there is no free will .
now we can come up with the second the@@ or@@ em and say : if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will .
these the@@ or@@ em@@ s are absolutely logical and corre@@ ct .
and now the thing you can almost read da@@ ily in the pa@@ pers is what you find in this third the@@ or@@ em .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ im@@ s and is thus of un@@ sound mind .
here you have it again .
really , you ’ d have to pro@@ ve , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
but the logi@@ c of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first the@@ or@@ em were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you ’ d have accept the opposite without any pro@@ of .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predi@@ ctors .
and don ’ t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ctors , which would be prop@@ he@@ t .
you mu@@ st@@ n ’ t say that , because that would be a little politi@@ cally in@@ corre@@ ct .
say , there are no predi@@ ctors .
you ’ ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it ’ s a matter of course that there are predi@@ ctors , you can ’ t pro@@ ve that .
and you ’ ll have a problem right away .
because while you are bu@@ sy telling yourself that you can ’ t pro@@ ve that there are no predi@@ ctors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
he ’ ll be very happy because he ’ s de@@ cei@@ ved you .
because he led you down a path he ’ s not on himself .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he ’ s only interested in kee@@ ping himself free of the ne@@ c@@ es@@ sity to pro@@ ve that there are predi@@ ctors .
so through this mode of pas@@ sing on the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving something you are experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
and if you have another opportunity to en@@ act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don ’ t remind them of their self-@@ de@@ ception .
thank you for your attention .
yes , h@@ ello .
i took the liber@@ ty i asked li@@ l@@ ly , if it would be okay to men@@ tion her .
she ’ s one of the organi@@ z@@ ers of this wonderful ev@@ ent and asked me to hold a present@@ ation and present my idea .
i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wi@@ tn@@ essed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
but of course it ’ s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad ecolo@@ gi@@ cal image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it ’ s called k@@ it today .
and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and they didn ’ t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ f@@ en nuclear research plant .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ li@@ ch was also called a k@@ f@@ a .
today they ’ re called project execu@@ ting organizations .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ d@@ ul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred watt per square met@@ re , that was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin there was this cra@@ zy engineering colle@@ ctive .
i ’ m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind premi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ habi@@ li@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad .
but it wasn ’ t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties .
at that time , there were self-@@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in k@@ re@@ u@@ z@@ berg in me@@ hr@@ ing@@ h@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was was called wu@@ sel@@ troni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that ’ s where i started out in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really mo@@ ves me , because many , many nice stat@@ ements were made , which i also was part of .
i worked in the colle@@ ctive for el@@ even years , it was based on a gras@@ s@@ roots democracy .
we were a group of tw@@ enty people .
if one person said no , there was the ve@@ to principle , which was totally de@@ morali@@ sing , for ten years , i i had gra@@ ve dou@@ b@@ ts as to whether i was perhaps really wa@@ sting my great engineering degre@@ e on something ridiculous , also because all my father ’ s colleagues had told him , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .
he ’ s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense .
and that was really very , very bi@@ tter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don ’ t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deut@@ sch@@ mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the colle@@ ctive of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en n@@ ine@@ ty six and then i became the co@@ -@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would de@@ di@@ cate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &apos;s cra@@ zy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introdu@@ ce to you .
the title of the present@@ ation was , how to reach one hundred percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
and we started asking with a rela@@ tively simple and cra@@ zy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on a@@ z@@ or@@ es .
yes , here is the data .
four and a half thousand people live there .
they have a ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy share of fi@@ f@@ te@@ en percent at the moment .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because technologi@@ cally it &apos;s just not possible .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fa@@ il .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politi@@ cians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of .
they then also say , why ?
we have tw@@ enty percent in ger@@ many .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physi@@ cally , the european one .
if we had tw@@ enty percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
the question is just , calcu@@ late that was in two thousand and six , the first cont@@ act started with the island , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fi@@ f@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ watts electri@@ cal out@@ put on di@@ es@@ el fuel basis is ad@@ ded in the world per year .
that &apos;s equi@@ valent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is re@@ lie@@ ved with di@@ es@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a li@@ cen@@ se for it .
it goes fast .
you put a box like this over there .
and that generally looks like this .
in it , there are always three di@@ es@@ els running , two are always main@@ ta@@ ined .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
we were given very accu@@ rate data .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small qu@@ anti@@ ties .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay ,
the di@@ es@@ el will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will ser@@ ve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , you have to switch off di@@ es@@ el .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es can take over the entire network .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
that is do@@ able .
but if you want to ho@@ ok up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to constru@@ ct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach se@@ vent@@ y to n@@ ine@@ ty percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ enty percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from batter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .
that will defini@@ tely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydrogen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ on@@ al reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ mi@@ ll electro@@ chemical battery .
how far would you get with that ?
and then we tried out a whole load of simu@@ lations .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compar@@ ed to the conven@@ tional system , which needs a medi@@ um electricity price of about fi@@ f@@ ty c@@ ents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ enty years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about for@@ ty-@@ four c@@ ents .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
and then we said , okay ,
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the di@@ es@@ el system , if the price of di@@ es@@ el ri@@ ses by five percent a year .
and then we started ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating with the is@@ l@@ anders .
what needed to be done ?
we ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated with inve@@ stors , i looked for new sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the organi@@ sation .
and here you have the graphic again .
the brown bit is the conven@@ tional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ enty percent di@@ es@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and the power u@@ ti@@ lity , which which the electri@@ c u@@ ti@@ lity on the island , said they think it ’ s great .
they said , we want to support it , but we don ’ t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that ’ s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could preci@@ sely re@@ constru@@ ct , so to speak , the electri@@ cal ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
natur@@ ally it ’ s from asia , in this case from japan .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the bbc man@@ n@@ heim , called ab@@ b today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then li@@ cen@@ sed to the japanese .
it is you can see that it ’ s a very , very big battery .
it has a mega@@ watt out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it ’ s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
and then pres@@ ented .
we also brought one of these di@@ es@@ el aggre@@ g@@ ates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynami@@ c behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the di@@ es@@ el is behind it , here ’ s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
over here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission gui@@ dance system , the c@@ able ’ s kilometer physics , to illu@@ stra@@ te the vibra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred kilo@@ watt + to the network .
we can see it again here we can see the di@@ es@@ el again here , and all the individual aggre@@ g@@ ates here .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed practi@@ cally everything that could be developed elec@@ troni@@ cally and in terms of software between the individual systems .
so we ’ re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the the@@ me of the battery and the the@@ me of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ fi@@ ve-@@ thir@@ ty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to li@@ mit the wind and sun .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart gri@@ d .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mobi@@ lity on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
that means that if you ’ re at se@@ vent@@ y percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then you won ’ t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should defini@@ tely be done , but you ’ ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely .
and that ’ s kind of the message .
that ’ s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ari@@ se .
if we turn off the di@@ es@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain amount of i@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network .
and our european energy gri@@ d basically consi@@ sts of ro@@ tat@@ ing masses of large power plants , where the a@@ x@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of europe .
we look into this network , see the fi@@ f@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .
that ’ s the system .
and of course that ’ s incredibly slow .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently .
if you don ’ t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass any@@ more , then you have to re@@ place it with power electronics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milli@@ seconds .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ enty , tw@@ enty , tw@@ enty percent , tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase our mu@@ st-@@ run cap@@ aci@@ ties in the network .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency .
yes , this is a huge de@@ ba@@ te at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al-@@ burning power plants , because o@@ ther@@ wise we wouldn ’ t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that ’ s not possible .
and we ’ re just trying to demon@@ stra@@ te that we can de@@ cre@@ ase the cap@@ aci@@ ties , the mu@@ st-@@ run cap@@ aci@@ ties , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
than@@ k@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried out on this topic .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experim@@ ental equipment on the , basically our te@@ sting equipment on the island .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
and many disc@@ us@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir@@ ty years re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ tai@@ cs .
you can ’ t do it , it ’ s non@@ sense , a pla@@ y@@ thing for kids , we calcul@@ ated everything , it will never add up .
we have thir@@ ty gi@@ ga@@ watt of photo@@ -@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic power in ger@@ many .
that ’ s ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
and i simply as@@ sume that we ’ ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thir@@ ty years .
it ’ s simple , that ’ s what will happen .
there will be a whole load of resi@@ stance and arguments .
the nice thing is that i ’ ve experienced that scientists have been jo@@ ining my side in the last couple of years .
we ’ ve been given over ten million funded projects , also to atta@@ ch a ten@@ -@@ mega@@ watt battery to the ger@@ man network .
that will take place next a@@ pri@@ l .
so you ’ re noti@@ cing a change is taking place , from a de@@ fen@@ sive at@@ titude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .
and when you have one hundred percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then it ’ s like a self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient system .
up till now the following is always argu@@ ed in disc@@ us@@ sions , these is@@ l@@ anders are becoming self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our jo@@ int network .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossi@@ l or nuclear fu@@ els which are dri@@ ll@@ ed out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they ’ re an island .
then they ’ ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and that is kind of our vision of sen@@ sible energy use and i am gr@@ ate@@ ful to the cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le institute that they said , use solar power .
and that ’ s what we ’ re doing , and so in this sense we ’ re coming together , also if you look at the present@@ ation by premi@@ um col@@ a , that it ’ s okay to be a colle@@ ctive and use solar power .
and yes , well , i ’ d just like to mo@@ tiv@@ ate you , in the sense that it ’ s fine to be a bit cra@@ zy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while doing so , but i think it ’ s it ’ s possible .
thank you .
