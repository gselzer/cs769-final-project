one day , los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ oli@@ n that only had two str@@ ings .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert do@@ w@@ ney j@@ r@@ . acting as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and ja@@ mi@@ e fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ th@@ ani@@ el an@@ th@@ ony a@@ yers , the ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bas@@ si@@ st whose pro@@ mis@@ ing career was cut short by a tragic aff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ ano@@ id schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ el dropped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angeles .
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that b@@ ond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the streets .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t disney conc@@ ert hall .
he had just heard a performance of be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and four@@ th sym@@ ph@@ oni@@ es , and came back@@ stage and introdu@@ ced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ gari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and hi@@ ll@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ oli@@ n pas@@ sage work in the last movement of be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s four@@ th sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an e@@ mail from steve a few days later saying that na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interested in a vi@@ oli@@ n lesson with me .
now , i should men@@ tion that na@@ th@@ ani@@ el re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic epi@@ so@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
and na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in such a state of agi@@ tation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t disney conc@@ ert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invi@@ sible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ oning him in his sle@@ ep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ oli@@ n if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ oli@@ n pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ oli@@ n con@@ cer@@ to .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invi@@ sible pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ al@@ y@@ st .
and na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was transformed into understanding , a qui@@ et curi@@ o@@ sity and gra@@ ce .
and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ fted his own vi@@ oli@@ n and he started playing , by e@@ ar , certain s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts of vi@@ oli@@ n con@@ cer@@ tos which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ so@@ hn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from ba@@ ch to be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ รณ@@ k , all the way up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ on@@ en .
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spo@@ ke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phi@@ l@@ harmon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the par@@ ano@@ id , di@@ stur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , brilliant , ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musi@@ cian .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music is s@@ ani@@ ty .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an es@@ ca@@ pe from his tor@@ mented state .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression re@@ a@@ ches all of us and mo@@ ves us , inspi@@ res and uni@@ tes us .
and for na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
and i will always make music with na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t disney conc@@ ert hall or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
robert gu@@ pt@@ a .
robert gu@@ pt@@ a : i &apos;m going to play something that i sha@@ mel@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from c@@ elli@@ sts .
so , please for@@ give me .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve lo@@ ved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a best@@ s@@ eller on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was far@@ m-@@ rais@@ ed to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel good about s@@ elling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an ev@@ ent about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able problem for us che@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destru@@ ction .
n@@ ine@@ ty percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollu@@ te -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ effi@@ cient . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
that means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one po@@ und of farm tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the ev@@ ent , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not con@@ cent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , i called don .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolo@@ gist .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he men@@ tioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chi@@ cken p@@ el@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chi@@ cken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ ra@@ ps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what per@@ cent@@ age of your feed is chi@@ cken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chi@@ cken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chi@@ cken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , good@@ y-@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chi@@ cken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in south@@ ern spa@@ in .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
like twice over .
amaz@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ ci@@ ous .
who can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolo@@ gist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the south@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
they rais@@ ed be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
they built this intri@@ cate series of can@@ als , and they pus@@ h@@ ed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economi@@ cally .
and ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disa@@ ster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
what did they do ?
they rever@@ sed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of pushing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- b@@ ass , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely rever@@ sed the ecolo@@ gi@@ cal destru@@ ction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you st@@ are out at a horiz@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this thi@@ ck , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
okay ? there we are slo@@ gging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my kne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly condu@@ cting a biology le@@ cture .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a r@@ are bl@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed ki@@ te .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tioning the min@@ er@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tan@@ z@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qu@@ atic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ ci@@ ous fish i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish ta@@ ste so good ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom@@ ass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , it &apos;s what fee@@ ds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this proper@@ ty with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , un@@ like like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pin@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , a liter@@ al pin@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , pin@@ k .
they &apos;re fe@@ a@@ sting . &quot;
fe@@ a@@ sting ? i was totally con@@ f@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ a@@ sting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
well , last year , this proper@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ ctu@@ ari@@ es in all of europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
this is an ecolo@@ gi@@ cal network .
the fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ ctu@@ ary .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no kid@@ ding .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a whi@@ t@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t men@@ tion the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ ci@@ ous -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ; i don &apos;t like it sear@@ ed , i don &apos;t like it cri@@ sp@@ y .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , t@@ ar-@@ like fla@@ vor .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in south@@ ern spa@@ in , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
i men@@ tioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last de@@ fen@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants , pe@@ sti@@ cide run@@ off .
and when it works its way through the system and lea@@ ves , the water is cle@@ aner than when it ent@@ ered .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ cation plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water lea@@ ves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also instru@@ ctive .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new con@@ ception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love pin@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be hon@@ est ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribu@@ tion , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultur@@ es , chemi@@ c@@ als to soil , chi@@ cken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the moti@@ vation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fi@@ cation : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding ecolo@@ gi@@ cal capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ mini@@ shing supply , but because of di@@ mini@@ shing resources .
not by the lat@@ est combine and tra@@ ctor inven@@ tion , but by ferti@@ le land ; not by pump@@ s , but by fres@@ h water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecolo@@ gi@@ cal model .
that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
farms that aren &apos;t worl@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; farms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; farms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produ@@ cers , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
and if i &apos;m going to be really hon@@ est , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ ci@@ ous .
thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we con@@ sume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would o@@ ther@@ wise be invi@@ sible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , acci@@ dents .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
this is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory diseases and cancer are the usual su@@ spe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ strated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
you can ju@@ mp right into a specific issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the athle@@ tes that have appeared in this issue , the spor@@ ts .
i &apos;m a lance arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll cli@@ ck on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lance arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not sear@@ ching , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extra@@ po@@ late on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit cra@@ zy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we redu@@ ced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an i@@ con to indi@@ cate the t@@ opi@@ cal area that it comes from .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the t@@ opi@@ cal dom@@ a@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sele@@ ct government .
now , having sele@@ cted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not con@@ ta@@ ined within any one wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the maj@@ ority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can go , ju@@ mp , and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstra@@ ction .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific se@@ ction .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic sear@@ ching , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just la@@ unch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were o@@ ther@@ wise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y diet of science fi@@ ction .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and sa@@ tis@@ fied , in a nar@@ ra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ o@@ sity that i had .
and you know , that curi@@ o@@ sity also manifest@@ ed itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the woods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscop@@ e .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mi@@ rr@@ ored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
j@@ ac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
so , that seemed to reson@@ ate with the whole science fi@@ ction part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could pain@@ t .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movi@@ es and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to pain@@ t , to draw alien creatures , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the tex@@ t@@ book .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the j@@ ac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p someday -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and exo@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from read@@ ing these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a ym@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compar@@ ed to our own me@@ a@@ ger human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i chose a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly dra@@ wing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific nar@@ ra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water creature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated ani@@ ma@@ tion , c@@ g .
and this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g ani@@ ma@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , i should say -- i wi@@ tn@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
you know , it &apos;s arth@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
they were seeing something magi@@ cal .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with il@@ m , we created the li@@ qu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the premi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would lea@@ p@@ f@@ ro@@ g past the analo@@ g process@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advan@@ tage for a while .
but we found ourselves la@@ gging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually fo@@ unded the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely pus@@ h the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human e@@ mo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pus@@ h@@ ed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , i went and pi@@ tched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c ro@@ mance , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; ti@@ tani@@ c . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convin@@ ced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
and i talked them into funding an expedi@@ tion .
sounds cra@@ zy . but this goes back to that the@@ me about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic , looking at the real ti@@ tani@@ c through a view port .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it requi@@ red enormous plan@@ ning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fi@@ ction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , i really got bitten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation .
of course , the curi@@ o@@ sity , the science compon@@ ent of it -- it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ o@@ sity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
so , i was completely s@@ mitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curi@@ ous decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tani@@ c , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie ma@@ ker , and i &apos;m going to go be a full-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
and so , we started plan@@ ning these and we wo@@ und up going to the bi@@ s@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles .
we went back to the ti@@ tani@@ c w@@ re@@ ck .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior sur@@ v@@ ey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tani@@ c , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m oper@@ ating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tani@@ c .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ al@@ ed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ v@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is in@@ je@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of exist@@ ence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tur@@ es that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
they live in an environment of che@@ mo@@ synthe@@ sis .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 50@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fi@@ ction influ@@ ence , as a kid .
and i wo@@ und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y board , plan@@ ning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russia , going through the pre-@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal pro@@ to@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i wo@@ und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ biologi@@ sts , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
so , here we were making docum@@ entary fil@@ ms , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i &apos;d completely clo@@ sed the loo@@ p between being the science fi@@ ction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expedi@@ tions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no f@@ ame in it .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tani@@ c &quot; and &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the be@@ ach .
made all these fil@@ ms , made all these docum@@ entary fil@@ ms for a very limited audience .
no f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly kn@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ entu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a b@@ ond , creates a b@@ ond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynami@@ c .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory , doing &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movi@@ es .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organ@@ isms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthe@@ size out of all this ?
you know , what are the les@@ sons learned ?
well , i think number one is curi@@ o@@ sity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
i have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vi@@ ce for doing this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limi@@ tations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
nasa has this p@@ hrase that they like : &quot; fail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
but fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in explor@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of fai@@ th .
and no important en@@ dea@@ vor that requi@@ red innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deli@@ ver to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very strai@@ ght@@ forward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets e@@ mitted , that leads to a temper@@ ature increase , and that temper@@ ature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ re@@ ct effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temper@@ ature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temper@@ ature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squee@@ ze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ o@@ xi@@ de every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly ri@@ sing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero .
this equation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ produ@@ ctive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
the second fac@@ tor is the services we use .
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clothing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ ver@@ ed per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and read@@ ing their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
now , effici@@ ency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fertili@@ zer , or how we do air trans@@ port , where the rooms for improv@@ ement are far , far less .
and so , overall here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a fac@@ tor of three to even , perhaps , a fac@@ tor of six .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this four@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mira@@ cles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really cap@@ ture this ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demonstration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people en@@ jo@@ yed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ flies .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelie@@ vable scale and unbelie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many dire@@ ctions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fu@@ sion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossi@@ l fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full per@@ cent@@ age , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 qu@@ anti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the t@@ ough@@ est one here is this long-@@ term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billi@@ ons of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the sa@@ fe@@ ty , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concern@@ s about that .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t requi@@ re fuel -- they have some disa@@ d@@ van@@ tages .
one is that the density of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mi@@ tt@@ ent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
and , to dimen@@ sion@@ ali@@ ze this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for fl@@ ash@@ lights , for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electri@@ cal energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ a@@ ches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mi@@ tt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re cra@@ zy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gross has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ sl@@ a &apos;s investing in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mo@@ du@@ lar , li@@ qu@@ id .
and innovation really stopp@@ ed in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 9@@ 9 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
it is kind of a cra@@ zy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have great@@ ly improved cost profi@@ le .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a travel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ actor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ entu@@ cky .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire life@@ time of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hop@@ efully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
so , the other grade is : are we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ e@@ mission technology , have we dep@@ lo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these effici@@ ency meas@@ ures to start getting redu@@ ctions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temper@@ ature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big redu@@ ctions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ at@@ ory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al g@@ ore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ a@@ y book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vac@@ cine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation agen@@ da , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innova@@ tive appro@@ a@@ ches .
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 tax , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialo@@ gue be a more ra@@ tional , more under@@ stand@@ able dialo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
bi@@ l g@@ ates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the lo@@ cation that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as ad@@ verti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economi@@ cs , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same complexi@@ ties .
and it just si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ posal solution .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dr@@ y c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re redu@@ cing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ lo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ tary of energy here , talking about how this fi@@ ts into the energy agen@@ da .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the dead@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ shing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ du@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a mole@@ cule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a mole@@ cule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the ne@@ ga@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temper@@ ature of the earth stable ?
b@@ g : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ a@@ y the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an in@@ surance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ surance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geo@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
climate sk@@ ep@@ tics : if you had a sent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the sk@@ ep@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feed@@ back effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
you make the mi@@ sta@@ ke now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gen@@ t problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a ga@@ in later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the sk@@ ep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can disa@@ gre@@ e , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disa@@ ster is for that two billion .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more disc@@ us@@ sed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropriate .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s cra@@ zy how little it &apos;s funded .
well bill , i su@@ spe@@ ct i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
b@@ g : thank you .
several years ago here at ted , peter skil@@ l@@ man introdu@@ ced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , one y@@ ard of ta@@ pe , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design workshop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and archite@@ cts , even the c@@ tos of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exerci@@ se that reve@@ als very deep les@@ sons about the nature of collabor@@ ation , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ ent@@ ing themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
then they spend some time plan@@ ning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they spend the maj@@ ority of their time as@@ sem@@ bling the sticks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collap@@ se .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototy@@ pes , su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ sive prototy@@ pes , always kee@@ ping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototy@@ pes along the way .
designers recogni@@ ze this type of collabor@@ ation as the essen@@ ce of the i@@ ter@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feed@@ back about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototy@@ pe is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adul@@ ts .
who does the very best ?
archite@@ cts and engine@@ ers , than@@ k@@ fully .
thir@@ ty-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an execu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of faci@@ li@@ tation .
they man@@ age the process , they understand the process .
and any team who mana@@ ges and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
speci@@ alized skills and faci@@ li@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the w@@ inning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
we did the exerci@@ se again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototy@@ ping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep les@@ sons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and process@@ es to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden as@@ sump@@ tions .
because , fran@@ k@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototy@@ pe .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exerci@@ se .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step instru@@ ctions on this .
there are cra@@ zy examples from around the world of how people t@@ weak and ad@@ just the system .
there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a cont@@ act sport .
it dem@@ and@@ s that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototy@@ pe of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pret@@ end right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automo@@ bil@@ es or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convin@@ ced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ stal@@ gia , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobi@@ lity , opportunity , de@@ clin@@ ing rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grandparents pus@@ h@@ ed that number to 70 .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billi@@ ons of people on this planet .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s v@@ ani@@ shed .
we van@@ qui@@ shed it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ b@@ ella , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billi@@ ons of people , those are trium@@ ph@@ s of the scientific meth@@ od .
and to my mind , the scientific meth@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
that number &apos;s ri@@ sing , and it &apos;s ri@@ sing really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this globe .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billi@@ ons of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fiel@@ ds , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ tled progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people wra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ tled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even enti@@ tled to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ tled to ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ tled to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cin@@ es for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ ti@@ cally engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going cra@@ zy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we fi@@ le , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ ati@@ cs that were driving me cra@@ zy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ ati@@ cs at all .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , edu@@ cated people , de@@ cent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just di@@ stur@@ bed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be hon@@ est .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in ironi@@ c terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost fai@@ th in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ o@@ x@@ x , weapons of mass destru@@ ction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be sk@@ ep@@ tical .
ask questions , dem@@ and pro@@ of , dem@@ and evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemi@@ c of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epidemi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ sm to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ella vac@@ cine shot .
very sc@@ ary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government offi@@ cial giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disa@@ str@@ ous .
disa@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vac@@ cine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching mes@@ sa@@ ges of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k cau@@ sation and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a her@@ o , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vac@@ cine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 50@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
when paul spe@@ a@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without arm@@ ed gu@@ ards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vac@@ cine .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horri@@ ble diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long be@@ ach , and he &apos;s going to at@@ tend one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pret@@ end it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to wra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re u@@ sel@@ ess .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
i &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system su@@ cks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billi@@ ons of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; aca@@ i -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billi@@ ons of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ tary of h@@ h@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; hm@@ m , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mam@@ mo@@ grams , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
he killed 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of nee@@ d@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemi@@ c we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ ti@@ cally engine@@ ered food and the organic eli@@ te .
it &apos;s an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ ba@@ te . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a de@@ ba@@ te about words , about metaph@@ ors .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every bru@@ s@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of e@@ den .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we object to gene@@ ti@@ cally engine@@ ered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemi@@ c@@ als , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fiel@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ venting millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? gene@@ ti@@ cally engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ v@@ a for instance .
cas@@ sa@@ v@@ a &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it su@@ cks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemi@@ c@@ als .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ u@@ lar food .
this isn &apos;t about ri@@ ce k@@ ri@@ spi@@ es , this is about kee@@ ping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech coloni@@ ali@@ sm .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ gly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conver@@ sations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pil@@ ls have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s per@@ ception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 19@@ 50s .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i &apos;m just going to squee@@ ze my wri@@ st right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hop@@ efully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ ti@@ sm will hold the kni@@ fe .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wri@@ st to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ hood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shi@@ f@@ ts .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ ti@@ sm , but by chi@@ can@@ er@@ y , my inde@@ x finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ oni@@ shing thing .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pi@@ r@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a ro@@ und white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar pil@@ ls .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
a col@@ ored cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three pil@@ ls -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these do@@ sa@@ ges have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ ringe with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ je@@ ct this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ d@@ le .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very sharp , and i &apos;m going to just steri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not da@@ mi@@ an &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this nee@@ d@@ le through to the other side .
if you &apos;re que@@ asy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hot@@ el room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get que@@ asy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ aking you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not dum@@ b enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can twi@@ st that around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting que@@ asy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the nee@@ d@@ le out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wa@@ ve of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
this appli@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it appli@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ essed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance to ad@@ mit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word any@@ more , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might re@@ stri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ cum@@ stance that affe@@ cts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and@@ -@@ answer session after one of my le@@ ctures reported a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor appro@@ a@@ ches -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hur@@ t now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that keeps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor appro@@ a@@ ches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your tri@@ p to alb@@ ani@@ a ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ teller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
the stories of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspi@@ ring or great -- but one of them is this di@@ stin@@ ct ...
but one of them is di@@ stin@@ ctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just kee@@ ping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding dom@@ inated .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really strai@@ ght@@ forward : they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self keeps for us .
so we have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite di@@ stin@@ ct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that di@@ st@@ ingu@@ i@@ shes a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be cho@@ sen .
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ gging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
i mean , how much do we con@@ sume our memor@@ ies ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it rela@@ tively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have con@@ sum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week tri@@ p , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for con@@ sum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ si@@ c drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ di@@ cate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fair@@ ly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be meas@@ u@@ red ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or ple@@ ased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ sely this way .
the di@@ stin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how sa@@ tis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vi@@ ce ver@@ sa .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
we know something about what contro@@ ls sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not at@@ tend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the corre@@ ct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ i@@ er in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contra@@ st between california and other places , and that contra@@ st , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refle@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ i@@ er .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ i@@ er .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ i@@ er , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ minded of how horri@@ ble the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you men@@ tioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sample -- below an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
6@@ 0,000 .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gr@@ essi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the po@@ or@@ er they get .
above that , we get an absolutely fl@@ at line .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so fl@@ at .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you miser@@ y , and we can measure that miser@@ y very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ dea@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seri@@ ously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politi@@ cians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seri@@ ously and run public policy based on it ?
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to de@@ ba@@ te whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that de@@ ba@@ te fair@@ ly soon .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
this is going to influ@@ ence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ or@@ al economi@@ cs .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ g@@ oni@@ g@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ a@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , consider@@ ing how many ur@@ gen@@ t problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gen@@ t problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ be@@ sity , i believe that we need to as@@ pire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a por@@ tra@@ it by a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to cap@@ ture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but inten@@ se con@@ cent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of opti@@ mis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achi@@ ev@@ ed it .
it was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gen@@ t problems .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neighborhood in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worl@@ ds . but i also mean good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate .
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after fail@@ ure and try again .
and in real life , when we face fail@@ ure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel anxi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ ving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds .
so , the first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfe@@ ctly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this inspi@@ ring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feed@@ back .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us-@@ one strength , and pl@@ us-@@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ stant feed@@ back in real life .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us-@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us-@@ one cra@@ zy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 cra@@ zy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feed@@ back in real life .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so sa@@ tis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , colle@@ ctively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ liest pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the ma@@ gni@@ tude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also a@@ pt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a researcher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school from fi@@ f@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazi@@ l , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gen@@ t opti@@ mis@@ m .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ moti@@ vation .
ur@@ gen@@ t opti@@ mis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , comb@@ ined with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us bad@@ ly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ ctivity . i love it .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ i@@ er working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard mean@@ ing@@ ful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : epi@@ c meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspi@@ ring mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 arti@@ cles , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they are building an epi@@ c story .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an econ@@ om@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ v@@ a .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wi@@ tn@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ un@@ ts to no less than a mass exo@@ du@@ s to virtual worl@@ ds and online game environ@@ ments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an econ@@ om@@ ist . so , he &apos;s ra@@ tional .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is ra@@ tional , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
before we had a@@ wes@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histori@@ an her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the kingdom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something cra@@ zy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so engaging , and immer@@ se us in such sa@@ tis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ ctivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ ca@@ pe re@@ al-@@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not sa@@ tis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
they divi@@ ded the entire kingdom in half .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hop@@ efully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
now , this sounds cra@@ zy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the et@@ ru@@ sc@@ ans , who then led to the ro@@ man empire , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have sug@@ gest@@ ed that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; cra@@ zy story is actually true .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
so , this cra@@ zy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
that was the first re@@ al-@@ time strate@@ gy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ vot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
we do not want to try to predi@@ ct the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
we want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tur@@ es .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is fi@@ c@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news , videos , data fee@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affe@@ cted , how transportation is being affe@@ cted , if schools are clo@@ sed , if there is ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blo@@ g about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a trans@@ forma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
so , for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
and the premi@@ se was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movi@@ es , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astron@@ au@@ t , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social sa@@ fe@@ ty net . &quot;
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are invi@@ ting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insight , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
i would like to invi@@ te all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pri@@ ses to save the world .
so , i &apos;m going to wra@@ p up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ powers : bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ ctivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gen@@ t opti@@ mis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , i say : let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for it@@ ali@@ an wi@@ red .
i always keep my th@@ es@@ au@@ rus hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
let me read you the ent@@ ry .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ je@@ ctive : cri@@ pp@@ led , hel@@ pl@@ ess , u@@ sel@@ ess , w@@ re@@ cked , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ unded , man@@ gl@@ ed , l@@ ame , mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , wea@@ ken@@ ed , im@@ po@@ tent , ca@@ strated , paraly@@ zed , han@@ di@@ ca@@ pped , sen@@ i@@ le , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ i@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cra@@ ck@@ e@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ ted-@@ out ; see also hur@@ t , u@@ sel@@ ess and weak .
ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i was read@@ ing this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice bro@@ ke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sau@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old th@@ es@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting pri@@ mary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , nee@@ d@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a th@@ es@@ au@@ rus back then .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that per@@ cei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online edi@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
our language affe@@ cts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into exist@@ ence .
so , what reality do we want to call into exist@@ ence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ power@@ ed ?
by cas@@ u@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and casting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
one such person who open@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my chil@@ d@@ hood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ pon@@ t institute in wil@@ m@@ ington , del@@ aware .
his name was dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an it@@ ali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
i lo@@ ved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the ex@@ ception of my physical therapy ses@@ sions .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions of exerci@@ ses with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic band@@ s -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mu@@ sc@@ les , and i hat@@ ed these band@@ s more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exerci@@ ses , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these ses@@ sions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ me@@ e , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those band@@ s .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exerci@@ ses i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est fi@@ ve-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful da@@ ily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and pro@@ mis@@ ing experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an inher@@ ently strong , powerful and athle@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adul@@ ts in posi@@ tions of power can i@@ gni@@ te the power of a child .
but , in the previ@@ ous in@@ stances of those th@@ es@@ au@@ rus ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language has@@ n &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , las@@ er surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , ti@@ tani@@ um kne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to cla@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go ali@@ g@@ n with global groups of their own choo@@ sing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to off@@ er our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this p@@ hrase never s@@ at right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
impli@@ c@@ it in this p@@ hrase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or cir@@ cum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pi@@ t@@ falls of a life with prosthe@@ tics , or what other people per@@ cei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ad@@ ver@@ sity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ do@@ w .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s stru@@ g@@ gle .
there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ ver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ ver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ada@@ pt .
there &apos;s an important difference and di@@ stin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive soci@@ et@@ al opinion of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be descri@@ bed by those defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural stru@@ g@@ gle they might have .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those per@@ cei@@ ved de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wra@@ pped in the ad@@ ver@@ sity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , gra@@ pp@@ ling with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ ver@@ sity as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
this year we celebra@@ te the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illu@@ strated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to par@@ ap@@ hrase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ada@@ pt@@ able to change .
conflict is the gene@@ sis of cre@@ ation .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recogni@@ ze that the human ability to survive and fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ gle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ sity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ ver@@ sity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
ad@@ ver@@ sity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest ad@@ ver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exi@@ sted ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achi@@ ev@@ ing nor@@ mal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase the power of so many more children , and invi@@ te them to engage their r@@ are and valuable abilities with the community .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requi@@ red of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and u@@ sel@@ ess ; they were seen as r@@ are and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ani@@ a , and i was standing over a bu@@ sh@@ el of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ me@@ e mu@@ ll@@ ins . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did cli@@ ck .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arri@@ ved late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physician had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ ver@@ ed me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bul@@ a bones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobi@@ lity that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved new@@ spa@@ per cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole chil@@ d@@ hood , whether w@@ inning a second grade sp@@ elling bee , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ ade , w@@ inning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my spor@@ ts vict@@ ories , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x fac@@ tor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can accoun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly told o@@ ther@@ wise , and even if given a modi@@ c@@ um of support , if left to their own devi@@ ces , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condi@@ tion and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded prosthe@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one legs , i wouldn &apos;t have he@@ si@@ t@@ ated for a second .
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ cy back then .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have open@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are edu@@ cating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; edu@@ cate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s bri@@ tain , when they were moving from gram@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tra@@ cking &quot; here in the states .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the t@@ ough@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
and , of course , the hear@@ t@@ brea@@ king , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
those who were still around in school , besi@@ des the people who had dropped out .
a cru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cru@@ shed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cru@@ shed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , chil@@ d@@ like curi@@ o@@ sity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
if instead , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curi@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ teen@@ th@@ -@@ century persi@@ an poet named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , j@@ ac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps re@@ pe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you . how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more preci@@ se , more accu@@ rate and qui@@ cker .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stam@@ in@@ a .
would you like to be more attra@@ ctive and self-@@ confi@@ dent ?
how about living longer with good health ?
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about fi@@ t@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah , the maj@@ ority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al topic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
the great 20@@ th@@ -@@ century gene@@ ti@@ cist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communi@@ c@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ tled &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communi@@ cations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ y@@ n sch@@ ul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all dire@@ ctions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demon@@ strated a fi@@ t@@ ness to its environment .
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we bran@@ ch off of a common ance@@ stor to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ er@@ y of our cells is pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can take advan@@ tage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machin@@ er@@ y of a common bac@@ teri@@ um to produce the protein of human in@@ su@@ lin used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ?
this is not like human in@@ su@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
and speaking of bac@@ teria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ries in our gut more bac@@ teria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bac@@ teria ?
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospi@@ table environment for those bac@@ teria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no eff@@ ort on their part .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bac@@ teria , with the oc@@ ca@@ sional inter@@ ruption of the un@@ inten@@ ded for@@ ced ru@@ sh to the ex@@ it .
but o@@ ther@@ wise , you are a wonderful environment for those bac@@ teria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ isms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
that was us .
that also con@@ stitu@@ tes the enter@@ tain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so i hope you en@@ jo@@ yed it .
now when i was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i became en@@ am@@ ored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the exist@@ ence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ isms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ isms come online , things start to change .
sexu@@ al re@@ production ent@@ ers the picture .
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexu@@ al re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
in fact , you could say that the ine@@ vit@@ ability of the death of our bodies ent@@ ers in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexu@@ al re@@ production .
now i have to con@@ f@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of geor@@ ge bur@@ ns , who was per@@ forming still in las ve@@ gas well into his 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hot@@ el room door .
he answers the door .
standing before him is a gor@@ geous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says geor@@ ge , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to realize , as a physician , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ ct@@ ory , just different .
i was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pa@@ y@@ load into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the sea .
i think we would all understand the sen@@ ti@@ ment that wo@@ o@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily fa@@ vor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fa@@ vor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
that is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , bac@@ teria that are ther@@ m@@ ophi@@ lic and can survive at the ste@@ am vent heat that would o@@ ther@@ wise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that a hospi@@ table environment for them .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we will not evolve .
we have re@@ ached a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
and the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of genes that would o@@ ther@@ wise be sele@@ cted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it ada@@ pt to us as well as we ada@@ pt to it .
and by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gra@@ te and circu@@ late and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
and as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do coloni@@ ze distant planets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an enti@@ cing , intri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ ghten@@ ing possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultur@@ es , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
they &apos;re , in some cultur@@ es , choo@@ sing to have more mal@@ es than fe@@ mal@@ es .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choo@@ sing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or elimin@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequ@@ ence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
just a week ago , the national aca@@ de@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to francis ar@@ no@@ ld and wil@@ le@@ m ste@@ m@@ mer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desi@@ r@@ able proteins in a more effi@@ cient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ no@@ ld calls &quot; dire@@ cted evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he indu@@ ced that cell to rever@@ t to a pl@@ uri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human in@@ su@@ lin in bac@@ teria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce imm@@ uni@@ ty against other viruses .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ental trial going on with vac@@ cine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
what if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a , or change the new@@ ly fertili@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate the diabetes , elimin@@ ate the hem@@ ophi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ cap@@ aci@@ ties -- that better memory .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can au@@ gment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the quick twi@@ tch mu@@ sc@@ le that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ st@@ yle evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might requi@@ re 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
these are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
or , will we sele@@ ctively choose different at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uniform , or more ro@@ bu@@ st and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
i want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ oni@@ cs call these robots exo@@ skel@@ et@@ ons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to man@@ age your balance .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
but not only that -- it will integra@@ te and network you to the universe and other devi@@ ces out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is res@@ ul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ oni@@ c back in@@ ju@@ ries .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exo@@ skel@@ eton that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introdu@@ ce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
with the h@@ ul@@ c exo@@ skel@@ eton , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
its flexible design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ agi@@ lity mov@@ ements .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then au@@ g@@ ments my strength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introdu@@ ce this device , this new exo@@ skel@@ eton this year .
so this is for real .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the whe@@ el@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people est@@ im@@ ated to be in whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs worl@@ d@@ wide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
we are talking here about , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with spinal cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the whe@@ el@@ chair &apos;s the only op@@ tion .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
and the only op@@ tion , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations -- is the whe@@ el@@ chair .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu@@ ction , i must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobi@@ lity .
let me now introdu@@ ce you to ele@@ gs that is wor@@ n by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel that 19 years ago was spinal cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
thank you .
am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs set .
it has sens@@ ors .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive , sens@@ ors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her kne@@ e jo@@ in@@ ts , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural ga@@ it .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ hi@@ ll ski@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
in a spli@@ t second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my p@@ el@@ v@@ is .
not long afterwards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
he rob@@ bed every o@@ un@@ ce of hope from my being .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ hi@@ ll sk@@ i again , to rock climb and even hand@@ cycle .
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have disc@@ us@@ sions with you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future gener@@ ations -- not only for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the whe@@ el@@ chair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fir@@ es as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volun@@ te@@ er fire company .
now in our town , where the volun@@ te@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a highly skil@@ led career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volun@@ te@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volun@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the po@@ uring rain , under an um@@ br@@ ella , in her pa@@ j@@ am@@ as , bar@@ e@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volun@@ te@@ er who had arri@@ ved just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x luther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
here was some law@@ yer or money mana@@ ger who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
well , i was next .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house .
i need you to go up@@ stairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swe@@ ar .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no her@@ o .
i car@@ ried my pa@@ y@@ load back down@@ stairs where i met my ne@@ me@@ sis and the preci@@ ous dog by the front door .
we took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant eff@@ ort disp@@ la@@ yed in saving her home .
the act of kind@@ ness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my a@@ vo@@ cation as a volun@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ figh@@ ter , i am wi@@ t@@ ness to acts of gener@@ o@@ sity and kind@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ental scale , but i &apos;m also wi@@ t@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , remarkable levels of success , i would off@@ er this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
ser@@ ve food at a sou@@ p kit@@ chen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day is going to off@@ er us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that hol@@ ds the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say h@@ ello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , meet your cou@@ sins .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gl@@ es of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clo@@ sest relative .
that means we all share a common ance@@ stor , an evolutionary grand@@ mother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well-@@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an emp@@ ha@@ sis of this aspe@@ ct in our nar@@ ra@@ tives of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
while chimpanze@@ es are dom@@ inated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ mal@@ es .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tol@@ er@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great apes .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the con@@ go is a para@@ do@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , this destru@@ ction also en@@ dan@@ gers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
bu@@ sh@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small sta@@ di@@ um with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be hon@@ est .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laugh@@ ter swa@@ ying the trees .
who are these cou@@ sins ?
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; apes since they have frequ@@ ent , promi@@ sc@@ u@@ ous and bi@@ sexu@@ al sex to man@@ age conflict and solve social issues .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing tol@@ er@@ ance .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavi@@ ors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laugh@@ ter , dance and ritu@@ al .
play is the gl@@ ue that bin@@ ds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fres@@ h from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ st@@ yle -- and i do not mean foot@@ ball .
so here , we have a young female and a male enga@@ ged in a ch@@ ase game .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
it might be the evolutionary ori@@ gin of the p@@ hrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the ball@@ s . &quot;
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how play both re@@ quir@@ es trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more qui@@ et , imag@@ in@@ ative , curi@@ ous -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is qui@@ et@@ ly playing with water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we expl@@ ore the boun@@ dar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s that pla@@ yful curi@@ o@@ sity that dri@@ ves us to expl@@ ore , dri@@ ves us to interact , and then the un@@ expected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to ada@@ pt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
the secret is that play is the key to these cap@@ aci@@ ties .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive wil@@ d@@ card .
in order to ada@@ pt success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness ?
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
play &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and c@@ law .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gen@@ t .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mat@@ es , let us embra@@ ce this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ lo@@ w@@ ship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day , at the ex@@ act same moment , each con@@ cei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
so two cou@@ ples each con@@ cei@@ ving one baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the con@@ ception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that con@@ ception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a y chromo@@ some , meeting that x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an x chromo@@ some , meeting the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do .
as the one hat , i do history of anat@@ omy .
i &apos;m a histori@@ an by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with anat@@ omy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ i@@ ds , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fi@@ sm -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pi@@ cal sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an xy chromosom@@ al basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chromo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ stes .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ cept@@ ors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and this is a syn@@ dro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
as a consequ@@ ence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is rais@@ ed as a girl .
and it &apos;s often not until she hi@@ ts pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody fig@@ ures out something &apos;s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ vari@@ es inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ stes inside , and she has a y chromo@@ some .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
fe@@ mal@@ es , like mal@@ es , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ and@@ s .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ and@@ s make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a mas@@ cul@@ ini@@ zing hormone .
most fe@@ mal@@ es like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chromosom@@ al ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ mal@@ es like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensi@@ tive .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the consequ@@ ence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with te@@ stes who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spec@@ trum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , rais@@ ed a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ vari@@ es and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condi@@ tion called con@@ gen@@ it@@ al ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pla@@ sia .
he had x@@ x chromosom@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ and@@ s were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a mas@@ cul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .
and as a consequ@@ ence , his gen@@ it@@ als were mas@@ cul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas@@ cul@@ ine compon@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody su@@ spe@@ cted anything .
and it was only when he had re@@ ached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
some people who have x@@ x chromosom@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different vari@@ eties .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fi@@ sm , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually lea@@ ves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfe@@ ctly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ geri@@ es is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anat@@ omy comes with a particular identi@@ ty .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identi@@ ty ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african anat@@ omy in terms of your history .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
so we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ ali@@ sm .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ ali@@ sm .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ lin .
i had a lot of journali@@ sts call@@ ing me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journali@@ sts there isn &apos;t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable anat@@ omi@@ cal categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identi@@ ty categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our termin@@ ology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ com@@ fort@@ able areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is bat@@ tles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
we have very difficult conver@@ sations no@@ wa@@ days -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to stru@@ g@@ gle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s no@@ se , and if it twi@@ tched , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them yet .
if it stopp@@ ed twi@@ t@@ ching , you bur@@ y them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vi@@ tal organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a consequ@@ ence , we &apos;re stuck with having to stru@@ g@@ gle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we &apos;ve had before .
now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categ@@ ories would make somebody like me really happy .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gr@@ es@@ sive , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit to you that it makes me ner@@ v@@ ous .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musi@@ cal &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original anat@@ omi@@ cal ac@@ tivi@@ sts , and this is why .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an anat@@ omi@@ cal concept and re@@ plac@@ ed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all re@@ call , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , and the mon@@ ar@@ ch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of anat@@ omy .
the mon@@ ar@@ chs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ plac@@ ed it with a new anat@@ omi@@ cal concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the anat@@ omy that mat@@ tered was the com@@ mon@@ ality of anat@@ omy , not the difference in anat@@ omy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mitted because of a very va@@ gue concept of birth@@ right .
they were moving towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anat@@ omi@@ cal com@@ mon@@ ality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of anat@@ omi@@ cal com@@ mon@@ ality being more important than anat@@ omi@@ cal difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ vari@@ es is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own proper@@ ty , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; ain &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of color appe@@ aling to a com@@ mon@@ ality of anat@@ omy over a difference of anat@@ omy , again , success@@ fully .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that com@@ mon@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain divi@@ sions .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some divi@@ sions , anat@@ omi@@ cally , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we give up enti@@ r@@ ely on anat@@ omy .
i don &apos;t want to say fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
so there are some anat@@ omi@@ cal divi@@ sions that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings con@@ cei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both con@@ cei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 198@@ 0 .
hen@@ ry , by contra@@ st , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 198@@ 0 .
simply by virtu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than hen@@ ry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drin@@ k .
hen@@ ry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biologi@@ cally , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ d@@ ness in terms of what their rights are .
hen@@ ry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the xy one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ fted , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that hen@@ ry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
hen@@ ry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these anat@@ omi@@ cal categ@@ ories that persi@@ st that are in many ways proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anat@@ omy , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anat@@ omy might start fall@@ ing apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic at@@ titude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chromo@@ some .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosom@@ es .
but this is also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anat@@ omy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to ad@@ mit , that there are some gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab@@ ra@@ d@@ ors that i know that are more capable of in@@ formed , intelligent , mat@@ ure decisions about sexu@@ al rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ ali@@ ze the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also won@@ ders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mri ?
do we really want to go there ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job stru@@ ggl@@ ing with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexu@@ ally attra@@ cted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ der@@ ed , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very bad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a femin@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of anat@@ omi@@ es , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es in terms of the way they think and oper@@ ate in the world .
and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ mal@@ es , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vi@@ s@@ ers who knew i was interested in femin@@ ism -- i considered myself a femin@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the dum@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
femin@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so wh@@ ere@@ as the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we in@@ je@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anat@@ omy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identi@@ ty , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public con@@ f@@ es@@ sion , and that is , i &apos;m out@@ fi@@ t-@@ obsessed .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blo@@ gging a different , col@@ or@@ ful , cra@@ zy out@@ fit for every single oc@@ ca@@ sion .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stores .
aw@@ w , thank you .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing like my own personal tre@@ asure h@@ unt .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ fi@@ ts bring with her ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pants and that &apos;s it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ fi@@ ts right now .
does that sound good ?
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life les@@ sons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these ad@@ vent@@ ures wearing nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y ti@@ ger . &quot;
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jack@@ et , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you are happy , you are going to attra@@ ct other happy people to you .
tu@@ es@@ day : fi@@ tting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surro@@ unding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
we@@ d@@ n@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing dres@@ s-@@ up , or that i remind them of their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
so there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal st@@ yle is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conver@@ sations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to bro@@ o@@ kl@@ y@@ n , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another cra@@ zy , col@@ or@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good after@@ no@@ on , everybody .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
this is what we call , in our lab , sen@@ sible design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m it@@ ali@@ an ori@@ gin@@ ally , and every boy in i@@ tal@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good dri@@ ver and a good car .
and if the car and the dri@@ ver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that mon@@ it@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sens@@ ors colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mi@@ tting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an ac@@ tu@@ ating compon@@ ent .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electronics .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be ac@@ tu@@ ated .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
just as an a@@ side , i wanted to men@@ tion , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cru@@ st , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and ac@@ tu@@ ating is ent@@ ering our every@@ day objects .
that &apos;s from an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is organi@@ zing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an ac@@ tu@@ ator .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the inter@@ action we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , thre@@ w it at the moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ รฉ n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and ac@@ tu@@ ating it .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in i@@ tal@@ y .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been dep@@ lo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anon@@ ym@@ ous and aggre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
it &apos;s when i@@ tal@@ y won the so@@ c@@ cer world c@@ up .
some of you might remember , it was i@@ tal@@ y and fr@@ ance playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
and anyway , i@@ tal@@ y won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by mon@@ it@@ oring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the colo@@ sse@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
early after@@ no@@ on , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match beg@@ ins -- sil@@ ence .
fr@@ ance sc@@ or@@ es . i@@ tal@@ y sc@@ or@@ es .
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
second half . end of normal time .
first over@@ time , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
i@@ tal@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the w@@ inning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to celebra@@ te , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and con@@ sume .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track tr@@ ash as it mo@@ ves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volun@@ te@@ ers who helped us in se@@ at@@ tle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
here are the results we just ob@@ ta@@ ined .
from se@@ at@@ tle ...
after one week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transportation and con@@ vol@@ u@@ ted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bot@@ tle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ or@@ al change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my col@@ lea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we disc@@ us@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s ac@@ tu@@ ating our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ z@@ a , spa@@ in .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that spa@@ in and south@@ ern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , ta@@ ps , opening and clo@@ sing .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you ju@@ mp through , as you see in this image .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ lo@@ ch .
he li@@ ked it very much .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ ran@@ ce of the exp@@ o .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
here &apos;s the building working .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , te@@ sting the sens@@ ors that open the water .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sens@@ ors stopp@@ ed working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ z@@ a came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
not any@@ more a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to ju@@ mp without getting we@@ t .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as archite@@ cts , as engine@@ ers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predict@@ able .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchr@@ ony .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or disp@@ lay , like this -- a regular con@@ figu@@ ration in two dimen@@ sions .
or in regular , but in three dimen@@ sions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appe@@ ar in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many dire@@ ctions .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular gri@@ d as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an in@@ put that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to b@@ ol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the รฉ@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an in@@ put for fl@@ y@@ fire .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ utions being cap@@ tured .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion cap@@ ture .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london ol@@ ympi@@ cs .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud rais@@ ing -- like bar@@ n rais@@ ing , but with a cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acc@@ es@@ sible through the internet .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaig@@ n showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for desig@@ ning and doing a symbo@@ l .
that means something built in a city .
but tom@@ or@@ row it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pres@@ sing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ ctively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the ol@@ ympi@@ cs in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work i &apos;m trying to arti@@ cu@@ late that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
i first went to ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs .
i was in a@@ we .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
each i@@ ce@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they have a di@@ stin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
some re@@ fu@@ se to give up and hold on to the bi@@ tter end , while others can &apos;t take it any@@ more and cru@@ m@@ ble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an i@@ ce@@ berg , that they &apos;re is@@ ol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an i@@ ce@@ berg mel@@ ts , i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
as the i@@ ce@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ as@@ ing min@@ er@@ al-@@ rich fres@@ h water that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shes many forms of life .
i approach photograph@@ ing these i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making por@@ tra@@ its of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they m@@ elt ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an i@@ ce@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
it &apos;s a very r@@ are oc@@ ca@@ sion that you get to actually wi@@ t@@ ness an i@@ ce@@ berg roll@@ ing .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small bo@@ at .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot bo@@ at .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the i@@ ce@@ berg and where it is at the wat@@ er@@ line .
you can see here , it beg@@ ins to roll , and the bo@@ at has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge-@@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c i@@ ce@@ berg .
it &apos;s about 1@@ 20 feet above the water , or 40 me@@ ters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the i@@ ce@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
thank you .
i have had the di@@ stin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est i ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i artists in the 8@@ 0s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
and that was the on@@ set of als .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
he only has use of his eyes .
i was ex@@ posed to him .
i have a company that does design and ani@@ ma@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i is defini@@ tely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
so i went and met with his bro@@ ther and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his bro@@ ther said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devi@@ ces ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upper ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ surance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
these devi@@ ces aren &apos;t acc@@ es@@ sible to people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s ar@@ cha@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ aking idea how i was going to c@@ ash .
i com@@ mitted to his bro@@ ther and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so i spo@@ ke at a conference a couple months after that .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexu@@ al organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush sl@@ anders and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their present@@ ations .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things .
one , we batter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ surance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
and he &apos;s seri@@ ously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an e@@ mail from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven program@@ mers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and program@@ mers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy theori@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we program@@ med , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glasses that we bought at the ven@@ ice be@@ ach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from home de@@ pot and radio sha@@ ck .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limi@@ tations .
there &apos;s no in@@ surance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was a@@ wes@@ ome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle going on for the big un@@ vei@@ ling .
and after over a year of plan@@ ning , two weeks of program@@ ming , car@@ b-@@ fest and all@@ -@@ night ses@@ sions , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an e@@ mail , and this is what the e@@ mail said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally re@@ ached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ?
so that &apos;s kind of our bat@@ tle c@@ ry .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equi@@ valent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ck@@ ets .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ ored us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in a@@ pri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ffen mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the street art scene -- ban@@ k@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fai@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty a@@ wes@@ ome .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cular recogni@@ tion technology , but i just recogni@@ zed something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever chose far@@ mer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ ph@@ ani@@ es .
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ bro@@ ke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
i was the guy be@@ aten up b@@ loo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; lo@@ un@@ ge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. po@@ st@@ en , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adul@@ ts .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
and i should men@@ tion that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospi@@ ce .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and wat@@ ched over her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was plac@@ ed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had clo@@ sed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any i talked about pres@@ ented itself .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved her@@ s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been men@@ tioned so much here today .
it also needs -- it needs di@@ gni@@ ty , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3@@ ,000 ft .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
it sounds sc@@ ary .
well i had a unique se@@ at that day . i was sitting in 1@@ d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant any@@ more .
i could see in her eyes , it was ter@@ ror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to mend , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne anything in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the geor@@ ge washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my own humanity and mi@@ stakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to elimin@@ ate negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clo@@ ck starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please b@@ low up . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ ari@@ es .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ d@@ ness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
... yet .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
i realized at that point , by conne@@ cting those two d@@ ots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
i was given the gift of a mira@@ cle , of not dying that day .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment faci@@ lity .
the gra@@ y boxes that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now if we man@@ age to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
the gra@@ y boxes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we man@@ age to place a good windows virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we are in business .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pper .
the pa@@ y@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
i want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pper part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y boxes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a dire@@ cted attack .
it &apos;s completely dire@@ cted .
the dro@@ pper is pro@@ w@@ ling activ@@ ely on the gra@@ y box if a specific con@@ figu@@ ration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clo@@ ck , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in ger@@ many .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s stru@@ ctu@@ red in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
they knew all the bi@@ ts and bi@@ tes that they had to attack .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pper of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pa@@ y@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about -- around about 1@@ 5,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ st@@ yle as@@ sem@@ bly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
so we do need target theori@@ es that we can pro@@ ve or di@@ sp@@ ro@@ ve .
in order to get target theori@@ es , we remember that it &apos;s defini@@ tely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been reported .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bu@@ she@@ hr nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ an@@ z fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an eff@@ ort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an eff@@ ort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engine@@ ers cra@@ zy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 1@@ 6@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
i started to research scientific literature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ an@@ z and found they are stru@@ ctu@@ red in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 1@@ 6@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , sta@@ ges .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been ob@@ ta@@ ined over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gl@@ es .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ ca@@ de , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determined what the target is .
it is nat@@ an@@ z , and it is only nat@@ an@@ z .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the in@@ put values from sens@@ ors -- so for example , from pressure sens@@ ors and vibra@@ tion sens@@ ors -- and it provi@@ des le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake in@@ put data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake in@@ put data is actually pr@@ ere@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movi@@ es where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ ere@@ cor@@ ded video .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gr@@ es@@ sive .
the idea is to cir@@ cum@@ vent a digital sa@@ fe@@ ty system .
we need digital sa@@ fe@@ ty systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste@@ am turb@@ ine gets too over speed , you must open re@@ lief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
so this is where we need digital sa@@ fe@@ ty systems .
and when they are com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can b@@ low up .
and neither your oper@@ ators nor your sa@@ fe@@ ty system will notice it .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
think about this : this attack is generi@@ c .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automo@@ bi@@ le factory .
it is generi@@ c .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deli@@ ver this pa@@ y@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber we@@ apo@@ n of mass destru@@ ction .
that &apos;s the consequ@@ ence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environ@@ ments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
thanks .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely reported that people as@@ sume that mos@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the mos@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because o@@ ther@@ wise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situ@@ ations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i film@@ ed in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horri@@ ble situ@@ ations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine soci@@ et@@ al issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hop@@ efully break them down in a way that make them enter@@ taining and acc@@ es@@ sible to an audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sa@@ ges , some twitter mes@@ sa@@ ges , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 20@@ 11 ted talk .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ life@@ time opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
it &apos;s a lot .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , ad@@ verti@@ sing .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situ@@ ations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and ad@@ verti@@ sing , where the entire film is funded by product plac@@ ement , marketing and ad@@ verti@@ sing .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the@@ -@@ title spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ di@@ um , the sta@@ ples center ...
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever .
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more for emp@@ ha@@ sis .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand x title spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drin@@ k you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brand@@ s are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1.@@ 5 million .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious brand@@ s .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
j@@ k : both .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
a@@ wes@@ ome .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which brand@@ s .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ record conversation . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
i was ama@@ zed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of ad@@ verti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ se@@ ction of new media and old media and the fra@@ ctu@@ red media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one f@@ at@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; charac@@ teri@@ zed by vi@@ sibility or acc@@ es@@ sibility of information , especially concern@@ ing business practi@@ ces -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
our politi@@ cians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like that odd , st@@ ill@@ -@@ scre@@ aming be@@ ar .
it &apos;s un@@ predict@@ able -- like this odd country road .
and it &apos;s also very risk@@ y .
what else is risk@@ y ?
eating an entire bo@@ w@@ l of cool whi@@ p .
that &apos;s very risk@@ y .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three si@@ des to every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john b@@ ond and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ b@@ au@@ m for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conver@@ sations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood fil@@ ms , and i have friends who make little independent fil@@ ms like i make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movi@@ es say the reason their fil@@ ms are so successful is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent fil@@ ms say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movi@@ es ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so how speci@@ fi@@ cally will we see ban in the film ?
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see ban de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
while any@@ time i do an inter@@ view with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fres@@ h enough for this inter@@ view ?
are you ready ? you look a little ner@@ v@@ ous .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
so maybe you should put some one before the inter@@ view . &quot;
so we &apos;ll off@@ er one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ or@@ al fu@@ sion &quot; or a &quot; paradi@@ se win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
that &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the fi@@ ve-@@ cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brand@@ s have .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
super@@ ior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
we talk about b@@ old , fres@@ h .
i think &quot; fres@@ h &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categ@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and we@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
it keeps you fres@@ h .
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ hn@@ ess , more fres@@ hn@@ ess , three times fres@@ her .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi@@ -@@ million dollar corpo@@ ration .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like really nice clo@@ th@@ es .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dr@@ y day .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
unique .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , st@@ yle i am would be like dark glam@@ or .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ory , like sun@@ glasses , or i like cr@@ yst@@ al and things like that too .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas@@ u@@ al fly .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part bro@@ o@@ kl@@ y@@ n girl -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m the pe@@ t guy .
i sell pe@@ t to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i deli@@ ver the goo@@ ds .
failed wri@@ ter-@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic brand .
is that something ?
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
i &apos;m tom .
well we can &apos;t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter@@ se@@ ction of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ u@@ al fly .
and what i realized is i needed an exper@@ t .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ al@@ t@@ man in pi@@ tt@@ sbur@@ g .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ stle , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
if they could do it for them , sur@@ ely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things ste@@ mm@@ ed and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ mm@@ ed and started with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ pa stage are you in now ?
why is it important to re@@ boo@@ t ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er co@@ a@@ ster are you on ?
e@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of cra@@ zy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two di@@ stin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary si@@ des to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very ni@@ c@@ ely together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a para@@ do@@ x with those .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their str@@ eng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
what other brand@@ s are like that ?
the first on here is the classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
now there &apos;s pla@@ yful brand@@ s and min@@ d@@ ful brand@@ s , those things that have come and gone , but a pla@@ yful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a pla@@ yful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identi@@ ty , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
are you an up at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
or are you more of a down at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , reser@@ ved , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes are things like being pla@@ yful , being fres@@ h like the fres@@ h prin@@ ce , contemporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like er@@ ro@@ l fl@@ y@@ n@@ n , ni@@ m@@ ble or agi@@ le , pro@@ fan@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , magi@@ cal or my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f .
or are you more of a down at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te ?
are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophi@@ sti@@ cated like 0@@ 0@@ 7 ?
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , se@@ cure , sa@@ cre@@ d , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like the d@@ al@@ a@@ i lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
over the course of this film , we had 50@@ 0-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as pla@@ yful as myself and who ultimately em@@ power@@ ed us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an ad@@ verti@@ ser would normally never get behind .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the desire cent@@ ers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
we went to san pau@@ l@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door ad@@ verti@@ sing .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no po@@ sters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h@@ -@@ stra@@ pped schools all across america .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feed@@ back out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brand@@ s did .
they cut out the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film premi@@ ered at the sun@@ dance film festi@@ val , let &apos;s take a look .
according to bur@@ r@@ ell@@ es , the movie premi@@ ered in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media im@@ pres@@ sions for this film .
that &apos;s literally cover@@ ing just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
the film has@@ n &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to ga@@ in a lot of moment@@ um .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to ad@@ vi@@ sed their clients not to take part .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
i believe that when you pus@@ h people away from that , you &apos;re pushing them more towards fail@@ ure .
i believe that when you train your emplo@@ ye@@ es to be risk a@@ ver@@ se , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be re@@ ward challen@@ ged .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
we &apos;ve got to put that be@@ ar in a ca@@ ge .
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
and ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
em@@ c pres@@ ents : &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
so , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
i have in my pocket a check made out to the par@@ ent organization to the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be appli@@ ed toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
my name is am@@ it .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pi@@ tched this idea of doing something with muse@@ ums and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these muse@@ ums and these ar@@ t@@ works .
and so when i started travel@@ ing and going to these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ unch .
so , simple : you come to goo@@ g@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
you look around at all these muse@@ ums here .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mi@@ tage , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ i@@ tes , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
cli@@ ck and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexi@@ co , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one cli@@ ck , ju@@ mp .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
keep going . have fun .
expl@@ ore .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you cli@@ ck on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can cli@@ ck this -- but i &apos;m going to cli@@ ck this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ el technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
went in , and i started noti@@ cing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
i did a little research , spo@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a goo@@ se with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let &apos;s just quickly ju@@ mp into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
so another one of my favor@@ i@@ tes , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see bru@@ sh stro@@ kes ?
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this master@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ all@@ er@@ y .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these master@@ pieces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the muse@@ ums .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medi@@ um that we do justice to their ar@@ t@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a repres@@ ent@@ ation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mi@@ sphere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s enti@@ r@@ ely intui@@ tive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mi@@ sp@@ heres at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .
you can be logical and intui@@ tive .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experim@@ ental qu@@ ant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of logi@@ c to str@@ ing together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intui@@ tion to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intui@@ tion ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intui@@ tion from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intui@@ tion that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ cist .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a parti@@ cle physi@@ cist , because they don &apos;t play with car st@@ ops , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , every@@ day objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intui@@ tion , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a parti@@ cle .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an every@@ day object also follo@@ ws qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so i made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
and that &apos;s this piece of me@@ tal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of me@@ tal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ unk of me@@ tal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with a fres@@ h sili@@ con wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analo@@ gy .
you know how un@@ com@@ fort@@ able it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , fran@@ k@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
so qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs says that in@@ ani@@ mate objects feel the same way .
the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ ani@@ mate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of me@@ tal be@@ have qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cally , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a v@@ acu@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ unk of me@@ tal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we meas@@ u@@ red its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfe@@ ctly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was breathing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vibra@@ te and not vibra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the at@@ oms .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of at@@ oms that make up that ch@@ unk of me@@ tal are sitting still and at the same time those same at@@ oms are moving up and down .
now it &apos;s only at preci@@ se times when they ali@@ g@@ n .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ unk of me@@ tal is in two different places .
i think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ unk of me@@ tal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ unk of me@@ tal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ unk of me@@ tal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece me@@ tal was still there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intui@@ tion , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just qu@@ ant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s de@@ e@@ per .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ d@@ ness of qu@@ ant@@ um mechani@@ cs .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ con@@ cep@@ tu@@ ali@@ ze how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billi@@ ons of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just sub@@ stitu@@ te apartment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
you could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the surro@@ unding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ stra@@ ctions of construction .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that faci@@ li@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at one point , ja@@ vier said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bas@@ sy -- give some to the u.s. em@@ bas@@ sy ; give some to the can@@ adi@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ bas@@ sy gro@@ unds that they would o@@ ther@@ wise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 200@@ 9 , hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching con@@ stitu@@ tional crisis .
at the next regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed ele@@ ction , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that pro@@ mis@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his chi@@ ef of staff .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and error , a lot of user te@@ sting , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essen@@ ti@@ als .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and di@@ stur@@ b all the exi@@ sting apartment hol@@ ders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a lin@@ k to the ted@@ talk .
he showed it to ja@@ vier .
they called me .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ am@@ i , in a hot@@ el conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fair@@ ly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a p@@ ause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ habi@@ ted land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on janu@@ ary four@@ th and fi@@ f@@ th .
so i pres@@ ented another fac@@ t-@@ filled le@@ cture that inclu@@ ded a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilome@@ ters .
so i was trying to per@@ su@@ ade the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilome@@ ters .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundre@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ res .
everybody app@@ lau@@ ded poli@@ tely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your le@@ cture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
so i s@@ at down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could off@@ er new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ for@@ ced .
and the insight of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ surance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inve@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ stru@@ st .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilome@@ ters .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the congress to am@@ end their con@@ stitu@@ tion to have a con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the congress in fa@@ vor of this con@@ stitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
to be part of the con@@ stitu@@ tion , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on fe@@ bru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
immediately after that vote , on fe@@ bru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 2@@ 4@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ g@@ ation of about 30 hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mi@@ ts .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is sing@@ apo@@ re .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
so if you think about this practi@@ cally , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for mana@@ gers to come in , and also an ex@@ tern@@ al legal system .
one country has already volun@@ te@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t be the cour@@ t of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some finan@@ cing .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already sol@@ ved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to lo@@ cate in the ameri@@ c@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
around the world , there &apos;s 7@@ 00 million people who say they &apos;d like to move per@@ man@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go to the united states .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents ?
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
and my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted . do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
i recently did a sur@@ v@@ ey with over 2@@ ,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they follo@@ wed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
and they found that the average ce@@ o enga@@ ged in about 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at mana@@ ging those choices ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choo@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
o@@ ther@@ wise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ tled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drin@@ k ta@@ p water .
i used to love going to this store , but on one oc@@ ca@@ sion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thou@@ sand@@ -@@ year-old o@@ live trees .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the mana@@ ger , and i asked the mana@@ ger , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
and he poin@@ ted to the bu@@ slo@@ ads of touri@@ sts that would show up every@@ day , with cameras ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked ja@@ m for our experiment .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of ja@@ m .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the ent@@ ran@@ ce of the store .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some ja@@ m ?
more people stopp@@ ed when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopp@@ ed when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
of the people who stopp@@ ed when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wai@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affe@@ cts us even in very consequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
so now for the topic of today : financial sa@@ vings .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mi@@ r kam@@ en@@ i@@ ca , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ rement sa@@ vings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.s .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement sa@@ vings plan , the 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood to save more for tom@@ or@@ row .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates have now dropped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participa@@ te when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
so for those people who did choose to participa@@ te , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equi@@ ty fun@@ ds .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ com@@ mend for people when you &apos;re consider@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to off@@ ering people more and more choices .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ a@@ y choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less sa@@ tis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ ctively better .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning disp@@ lay .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an improv@@ ement of the choo@@ sing experience .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the gol@@ den cat corpo@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ s@@ elling cat li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in profi@@ ts by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
but the nin@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the nin@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce .
now in the financial sa@@ vings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best man@@ age the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ i@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in desig@@ ning , which was the program that they have at harvard .
every single harvard emplo@@ ye@@ e is now automatically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle fund .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
and the first thing i do is i ask the emplo@@ ye@@ es , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your emplo@@ ye@@ es can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your con@@ sum@@ ers . &quot;
now before we started our session this after@@ no@@ on , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to off@@ er people in this audience an all@@ -@@ expen@@ ses@@ -@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his off@@ er .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his off@@ er .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this tri@@ p .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ ctively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would vent@@ ure to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which br@@ ings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that i did with sh@@ l@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- emplo@@ ye@@ es that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing .
the one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sa@@ vings accoun@@ t by four percent .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
it turns out that in we@@ g@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y stores up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magaz@@ ines and i divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus i show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry disp@@ la@@ ys .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
if you think the disp@@ lay on the left is s@@ wing and the disp@@ lay on the right is ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly u@@ sel@@ ess categ@@ ori@@ zation sch@@ e@@ me .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ i@@ ce-@@ ma@@ ker .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
my four@@ th techni@@ que : condi@@ tion for complexity .
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easi@@ er .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they off@@ er per decision .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appe@@ ar .
so half of the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ f@@ ts .
the other half of the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ f@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
what am i going to look at ?
how enga@@ ged you are .
if you keep hi@@ tting the de@@ fau@@ lt button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hi@@ tting that de@@ fau@@ lt button over and over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my prefer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be mo@@ tiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged .
so let me re@@ cap .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condi@@ tion for complexity .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you man@@ age your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the trends mana@@ ger at youtube , and i profession@@ ally watch youtube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vi@@ ral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video up@@ loaded to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny per@@ cent@@ age ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of participa@@ tion and un@@ expe@@ c@@ ted@@ ness .
all right , let &apos;s go .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
wo@@ o@@ o !
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ ww@@ w@@ w !
last year , be@@ ar v@@ as@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vi@@ ral video , be@@ ar .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain be@@ ar .
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in janu@@ ary .
so what happened here ?
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as it would become .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l introdu@@ ce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of nowhere .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
michael j@@ . n@@ el@@ son from my@@ ster@@ y science theater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
un@@ like the one-@@ way enter@@ tain@@ ment of the 20th century , this community participa@@ tion is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
so &quot; ny@@ an cat &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed ani@@ ma@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
even cat@@ s were watching this video .
cat@@ s were watching other cat@@ s watch this video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ on@@ gst this tech@@ ie , ge@@ ek@@ y internet culture .
there were re@@ mi@@ xes .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
and then it went international .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participa@@ te .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; ny@@ an cat ? &quot;
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have con@@ ta@@ ined this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up@@ loaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy prote@@ sting bi@@ cycle fin@@ es in new york city , i ad@@ mit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
so i got a ticket for not ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ stru@@ ctions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do cre@@ ati@@ vely .
and so it all br@@ ings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
what does it mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative partici@@ p@@ ating communities , complete un@@ expe@@ c@@ ted@@ ness , these are charac@@ teri@@ stics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the po@@ pul@@ ari@@ ty .
i mean , as men@@ tioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , ju@@ stin bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
no one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
and these are not charac@@ teri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the enter@@ tain@@ ment of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three gener@@ ations , about how the ast@@ oni@@ shing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -@@ year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grand@@ mother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small bo@@ at in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
he is a poet , a pla@@ y@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s uni@@ ty and freedom .
imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
he re@@ treated into sil@@ ence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
i never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grand@@ mother never let me forget his life .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cru@@ sh us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a bo@@ at in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arran@@ ged marri@@ age , already with two small girls .
for her , life had di@@ st@@ il@@ led itself into one task : the es@@ ca@@ pe of her family and a new life in au@@ str@@ alia .
it was in@@ con@@ cei@@ vable to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a bo@@ at sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
all the adul@@ ts knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of pi@@ rates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adul@@ ts on the bo@@ at , my mother car@@ ried a small bot@@ tle of po@@ is@@ on .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grand@@ mother would drin@@ k .
my first memor@@ ies are from the bo@@ at -- the ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wa@@ ve , the vast and empty horiz@@ on .
i don &apos;t remember the pi@@ rates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our bo@@ at , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mal@@ a@@ ysi@@ an coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three gener@@ ations sha@@ ping a new life together .
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class subur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
un@@ like the sett@@ led mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class subur@@ bs , whose exist@@ ence i was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ tle@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
the sm@@ ells from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
and the s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car as@@ sem@@ bly line , working six days , double shi@@ f@@ ts .
somehow she found time to study english and ga@@ in it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we were poor .
all the dollars were allo@@ cated and extra tui@@ tion in english and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out , which was usually new clo@@ th@@ es ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
two pa@@ irs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
a school uniform down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
and there were r@@ are but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the oc@@ ca@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i : &quot; asi@@ an , go home . &quot;
go home to where ?
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
there was a gather@@ ing of resol@@ ve and a qui@@ et voice saying , &quot; i will by@@ pass you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of my grand@@ mother around the house .
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the bo@@ at .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
she open@@ ed a computer store then studied to be a be@@ au@@ ti@@ cian and open@@ ed another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gr@@ y and in@@ flexible , and trou@@ bled children caught between two worl@@ ds .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ s@@ ors were s@@ ought .
cent@@ ers were establi@@ shed .
i lived in parallel worl@@ ds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ and@@ s that i made on myself .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were pre@@ c@@ ari@@ ous , tragi@@ cally sc@@ ar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and is@@ ol@@ ation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was cho@@ sen as the young au@@ str@@ ali@@ an of the year .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
tan le , anon@@ ym@@ ous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invi@@ ted to speak in ven@@ u@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose exist@@ ence she could never have imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t know the pro@@ to@@ col@@ s .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an uns@@ un@@ g subur@@ b -- a grand@@ mother , a mother and two daugh@@ ters en@@ ding each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
she re@@ minded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the bo@@ at .
no had never been an op@@ tion .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spo@@ ke out on you@@ th un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and education and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of the mar@@ gin@@ alized and the di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spo@@ ke , the more i was asked to speak .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they lo@@ ved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
and even though i finished my degre@@ e , i realized i could not sett@@ le into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be than@@ k@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the bo@@ at .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ um@@ p@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
i have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able opti@@ mis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mi@@ lity and dar@@ ing .
so i follo@@ wed my hun@@ ches .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for who@@ m the lab@@ el &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of sou@@ p which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were cra@@ zy , but a few were brilliant , and we bro@@ ke through .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
after only one tri@@ p .
my hun@@ ches again .
three months later i had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grand@@ mother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social norm and the local m@@ and@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
life hadn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother rais@@ ed her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a m@@ and@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to cour@@ t and pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hot@@ el room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say good@@ by@@ e .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temple in foot@@ sc@@ ray and s@@ at around her cas@@ ket .
we told her stories and as@@ su@@ red her that we were still with her .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it r@@ uns through the women .
given who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
defe@@ at would have come too easily .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the bo@@ at .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet i am afraid of pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , of e@@ ase , of enti@@ tle@@ ment .
can i give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wa@@ ve , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the vast horiz@@ on that gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it and still see them saf@@ ely through , i would .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the four@@ th or fi@@ f@@ th row .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
or is it photograph@@ y ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ gger .
photos like this : construction going on along a bu@@ sy road .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of reali@@ sm .
or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ taining the level of reali@@ sm .
when i say reali@@ sm , i mean photo@@ -@@ reali@@ sm .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
so i think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alterna@@ te reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfe@@ ctly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but comb@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
it &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ ily lives .
but when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because o@@ ther@@ wise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but comb@@ ined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos comb@@ ined should have the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , photos comb@@ ined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
so by mat@@ ching color , contra@@ st and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photo@@ graphic defe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
so here &apos;s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this image is actually enti@@ r@@ ely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
i personally think that it &apos;s easi@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it does requi@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing tri@@ p .
the shor@@ es are from a different lo@@ cation .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dish .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to plan@@ ning .
it always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fa@@ il .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopp@@ ed listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at ra@@ d@@ b@@ oud university is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a chi@@ ef listening offi@@ cer .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of tea and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fa@@ il , since we stopp@@ ed listening .
this is my wi@@ fi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that wh@@ en@@ ever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ fi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light l@@ unch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ be@@ sity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled dem@@ and and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introdu@@ ced by a little video .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ g@@ ation contro@@ ls in our car .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
we know perfe@@ ctly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s clo@@ sed , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mitted .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
and we built an i@@ pad appli@@ cation .
we made an appli@@ cation for la@@ y@@ ar , au@@ g@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and wh@@ en@@ ever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introdu@@ ce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we would like to start this on a worl@@ d@@ wide level .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , col@@ lea@@ gue universi@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these a@@ e@@ ds all around the world .
that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re on holi@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mitted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected discover@@ ies .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by pa@@ ying attention to ...
... pa@@ ying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
hu@@ h . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- i &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall .
and there they make great apps , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to di@@ gging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named eri@@ k mi@@ cha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynami@@ cs on it .
this is a mod@@ est little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 apps that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .t. department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t ts@@ un@@ am@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these ts@@ un@@ am@@ i si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies out of them .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and then se@@ at@@ tle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
and chi@@ ca@@ go just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
so we now know of nine cities that are plan@@ ning to use this .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organi@@ cally , natur@@ ally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there is one project in the california cour@@ t system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and that &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of colle@@ ctive action .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at colle@@ ctive action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
they are fru@@ strated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really ma@@ d about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people ele@@ cted to office .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
so scot@@ t gets this call .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing lea@@ ves ? &quot;
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechani@@ cs in boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tras@@ h@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this lo@@ cation , found the tras@@ h@@ can behind the house .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? ye@@ p .
turned tras@@ h@@ can on its side . walked home .
good@@ night sweet o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we str@@ eng@@ then our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other .
that our in@@ put to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
now how many times have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader ele@@ cted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ in@@ ch la@@ yer on top .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dise@@ m@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machin@@ er@@ y of government .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ th@@ es@@ e@@ c movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 2@@ 5@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s re@@ qu@@ est for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill .
that &apos;s not being politi@@ cally active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ ti@@ cally active .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundam@@ entally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s gro@@ wn up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to archite@@ ct the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 2@@ 8 , so i am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s gro@@ wn up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
they &apos;re not fighting that bat@@ tle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can ex@@ press their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better .
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pulling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ bage can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital re@@ min@@ ders that we &apos;re not just con@@ sum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just con@@ sum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jump@@ s in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fi@@ le .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of ma@@ gni@@ tude in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a fl@@ at line .
but when something like this happens , things are quali@@ ta@@ tively changing .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tom@@ or@@ row , i would be able to get in a ta@@ x@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by orders of ma@@ gni@@ tude every few years .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ?
because the transition seems very , very con@@ f@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole life@@ time .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , steri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemi@@ c@@ als flo@@ ating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemi@@ c@@ als got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i think that there &apos;s theori@@ es that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemi@@ c@@ als in them .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemi@@ c@@ als in them which caused them to in@@ corpo@@ rate chemi@@ c@@ als from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemi@@ c@@ als .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemi@@ c@@ als within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating chemi@@ c@@ als around them , grew more and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated more chemi@@ c@@ als and divi@@ ded more .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ grams of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 2@@ 2 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ enty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had really been a e@@ go@@ ti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communi@@ cating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bac@@ teria can actually exchange dna .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , anti@@ bio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
some bac@@ teria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ i@@ c@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bac@@ teria , and now we have a lot of bac@@ teria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ i@@ c@@ il@@ lin , because bac@@ teria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same bo@@ at together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were re@@ pe@@ ated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one str@@ ing of dna .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi@@ -@@ cellu@@ lar communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organ@@ ism .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi@@ -@@ cellu@@ lar community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves any@@ more .
your skin cell is really u@@ sel@@ ess without a heart cell , mu@@ sc@@ le cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organ@@ ism .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neu@@ ral structures .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ ali@@ sts in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the ner@@ v@@ ous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advan@@ tage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organ@@ ism , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
so an organ@@ ism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got si@@ ck last time it ate it .
that could happen within the life@@ time of a single organ@@ ism , wh@@ ere@@ as before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evol@@ ution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
so that ner@@ v@@ ous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communi@@ cating .
and for example , the most sophi@@ sti@@ cated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing inven@@ tion if you think about it .
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , con@@ f@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hop@@ efully constru@@ cting a similar mess@@ y , con@@ f@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ gy to it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequ@@ ences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organ@@ ism .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ cting out .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi@@ -@@ cellu@@ lar organ@@ isms have gone through -- abstra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , present@@ ing , process@@ ing information .
so for example , the inven@@ tion of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ apes , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechan@@ isms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like ner@@ v@@ ous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ al@@ y@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechan@@ isms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ stor in the connection machine does .
there are billi@@ ons of them .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one meth@@ od that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of instru@@ ctions .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of instru@@ ctions .
now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of instru@@ ctions , run all of those pro@@ grams , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ sest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
so find the pro@@ grams that come clo@@ sest to sor@@ ting numbers .
so of course , random sequ@@ ences of instru@@ ctions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
take two pro@@ grams and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children inher@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two pro@@ grams .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of pro@@ grams that are produced by combin@@ ations of the pro@@ grams that did a little bit better job .
say , &quot; please re@@ pe@@ at that process . &quot;
score them again .
introdu@@ ce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those gener@@ ations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
so i can do the equi@@ valent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , i end up with pro@@ grams that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
in fact , they are pro@@ grams that are much more effi@@ cient than pro@@ grams i could have ever written by hand .
now if i look at those pro@@ grams , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird pro@@ grams .
but they do the job .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of pro@@ grams that did the job .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
we &apos;re now using those pro@@ grams to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so con@@ f@@ using .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ isms were turning into multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ isms .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so l@@ unch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sele@@ cted out .
my story beg@@ ins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ fi sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d ju@@ mp into a chari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bo@@ w , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ plac@@ ed by machin@@ er@@ y .
and this made me really sad .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver pocket watch .
and this piece of 50@@ -@@ year-old technology became the most magi@@ cal thing to me .
it became a gi@@ l@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of pi@@ rates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopp@@ ed us from dre@@ aming .
they stopp@@ ed us from being inspired .
and so i jump@@ ed in , i jump@@ ed into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect re@@ a@@ ders all over the world .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it can know where we are .
it br@@ ings together image and text and ani@@ ma@@ tion and sound and touch .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi@@ -@@ sens@@ ori@@ al .
but what are we doing with it ?
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and la@@ unch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the i@@ pad .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belon@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and actually i become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addres@@ sed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of chil@@ d@@ hood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bor@@ ed as children .
this idea of fi@@ re@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fi@@ re@@ flies out .
and they actually illu@@ min@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be con@@ ta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this magi@@ cal device within the device .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
all along , all fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had ma@@ ps , but these ma@@ ps have been sta@@ tic .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ g@@ ation for the rest of the book .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fai@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ ym@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sticks and st@@ ones and pe@@ bb@@ les and sh@@ ells .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that any@@ more .
so in bringing back this chil@@ d@@ hood ritu@@ al , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put up online .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a colle@@ ction of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an inter@@ action where you take your i@@ pad out with the video on and through au@@ g@@ mented reality , you see this la@@ yer of anim@@ ated pi@@ xi@@ es appe@@ ar on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with lea@@ ves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come clo@@ ser together to technology , and magic and technology can come clo@@ ser together .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves clo@@ ser to the natural world and that magic and joy and chil@@ d@@ hood love that we had through the simple medi@@ um of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pri@@ sons , on death row .
i spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
and being here at ted and seeing the sti@@ mu@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identi@@ ty .
and you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and i men@@ tion that because i think identi@@ ty is really important .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic present@@ ations .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be mean@@ ing@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a com@@ passionate teacher , they can be especially mean@@ ing@@ ful .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
and so i want to talk about the power of identi@@ ty .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practi@@ cing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grand@@ mother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dom@@ inated by a mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , and that mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch was my grand@@ mother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
her parents were born in sla@@ very in virginia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world .
and my grand@@ mother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
and she &apos;d squee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sau@@ lt me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youn@@ gest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cou@@ sins would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ sins were running around .
and my grand@@ mother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then she s@@ at me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget it .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
well i ad@@ ored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drin@@ k al@@ co@@ ho@@ l . &quot;
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a bro@@ ther a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my bro@@ ther came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ p@@ ack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
my bro@@ ther said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
and then my bro@@ ther started star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation ma@@ ma had with you . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oh , ma@@ ma tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
i know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identi@@ ty .
when we create the right kind of identi@@ ty , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
when i thought about my grand@@ mother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to com@@ mit to .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our cri@@ minal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pri@@ sons .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundam@@ entally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ comes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
our system isn &apos;t just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
and yet , we seem to be very com@@ fort@@ able .
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually per@@ man@@ ently di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a cri@@ minal con@@ vi@@ ction .
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has per@@ man@@ ently lost the right to vote .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of di@@ sen@@ fran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
and there is this stun@@ ning sil@@ ence .
i represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sent@@ ence 13@@ -@@ year-old children to die in prison .
we have life im@@ pri@@ son@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve com@@ mitted ?
and that &apos;s a very sen@@ sible question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identi@@ ty .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they com@@ mit , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been execu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
a kind of ast@@ oni@@ shing error rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
in avi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would cr@@ ash .
but somehow we can in@@ su@@ late ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our stru@@ g@@ gle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla@@ very .
i tell them about terror@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war i@@ i .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and that era of terror@@ ism , of course , was follo@@ wed by se@@ gre@@ g@@ ation and decades of ra@@ cial su@@ bor@@ din@@ ation and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and yet , we have in this country this dynami@@ c where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histori@@ cally .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to com@@ mit ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come a@@ par@@ thei@@ d without a com@@ mit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in r@@ wand@@ a , even after the geno@@ cide , there was this com@@ mit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
i was giving some le@@ ctures in ger@@ many about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the present@@ ation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in ger@@ many .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in ger@@ many . &quot;
and the room got very qui@@ et , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about execu@@ ting people . &quot;
and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of ger@@ many was execu@@ ting people , especially if they were di@@ sp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately je@@ wish ?
i couldn &apos;t be@@ ar it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we ex@@ ec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the victi@@ m is white than if the victi@@ m is black , 2@@ 2 times more likely to get it if the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is black and the victi@@ m is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
well i believe that our identi@@ ty is at risk .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless impli@@ cated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love enter@@ tain@@ ment .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , degra@@ dation , mar@@ gin@@ ali@@ zation .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integra@@ te the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ e@@ ful , more com@@ mitted , more de@@ di@@ cated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we do . as ra@@ tional as we are , as com@@ mitted to intelle@@ ct as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
and it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that i believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ ent@@ ation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wi@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
well that ori@@ ent@@ ation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be enga@@ ged in .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fairness , to in@@ justice .
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identi@@ ty is a much more challenging identi@@ ty than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r who was the organi@@ zer of the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , repres@@ ented dr. king .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ on@@ gly con@@ vi@@ cted .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of cri@@ minal justice .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sentences for children .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ geous .
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on everyone &apos;s humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a thi@@ ef .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human di@@ gni@@ ty that must be respe@@ cted by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspi@@ ring and so sti@@ mul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
i sometimes pus@@ h too hard .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ ent@@ ing these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sentences .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14@@ -@@ year-old black male cli@@ ent like a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -@@ year-old corpo@@ rate execu@@ tive . &quot;
and i put in my motion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ t@@ ori@@ al mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
there was a cra@@ zy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that cra@@ zy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to cour@@ t .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh go@@ sh , i &apos;ve got to go to the cour@@ t and do this cra@@ zy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
and as i was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the j@@ ani@@ tor in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
and he whi@@ sper@@ ed in my e@@ ar .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identi@@ ty , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ e@@ ful .
well i went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this cra@@ zy motion ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
i had written these cra@@ zy things .
and police offi@@ cers were coming in and assi@@ stant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gr@@ y that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this j@@ ani@@ tor pac@@ ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holl@@ er .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and s@@ at down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sher@@ i@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that the j@@ ani@@ tor had come into cour@@ t .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jump@@ ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic di@@ gni@@ ty .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
that our visions of technology and design and enter@@ tain@@ ment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an eff@@ ort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all h@@ omi@@ cide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t result .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement and sa@@ fe@@ ty .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and part of the nar@@ ra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined rela@@ tively stable .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ t@@ ori@@ c of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
and so we have three stri@@ kes la@@ ws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level proper@@ ty cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
and i think our current p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment philosop@@ h@@ y does nothing for no one .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ ent@@ ation that we have to change .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
you &apos;re an inspi@@ ring person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
thre@@ ats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .

oh , my god .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i colle@@ cted over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media prefer@@ enti@@ ally fee@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ gd@@ ala .
now the am@@ y@@ gd@@ ala is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
so given a do@@ zen news stories , we will prefer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
and that old new@@ spa@@ per saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it leads , &quot; is very true .
so given all of our digital devi@@ ces that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ es@@ simi@@ stic .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extin@@ ction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we sur@@ ely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in ad@@ v@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an has more than dou@@ bled , average per capita income ad@@ ju@@ sted for inf@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
chil@@ d@@ hood mortality has come down a fac@@ tor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ fold .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time ever in human history .
and charles ken@@ n@@ y that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expe@@ c@@ tations higher and higher .
in fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
think of this , in america today , the maj@@ ority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ amed of such lu@@ x@@ u@@ ries .
under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally growing technologies .
my good friend ray kur@@ z@@ wei@@ l showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jump@@ s on this curve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now look at this curve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , re@@ c@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g curve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infinite computing ; sens@@ ors and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d prin@@ ting , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; synthe@@ tic biology ; fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ es and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als ; and a@@ .@@ i .
i mean , how many of you saw the w@@ inning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by i@@ b@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
i mean , that was epi@@ c .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a new@@ spa@@ per i could .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qui@@ shes human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
and imagine if you would a@@ .@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
four years ago here at ted , ray kur@@ z@@ wei@@ l and i started a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ari@@ ty university .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have so@@ unded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
today we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that .
when i think about creating ab@@ un@@ dance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lu@@ x@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was sc@@ ar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant .
you see , sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tu@@ al , and technology is a resour@@ ce-@@ liber@@ ating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i in the mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
he invi@@ ted over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
but the king of si@@ am , he was f@@ ed with al@@ um@@ in@@ um u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
you see , al@@ um@@ in@@ um was the most valuable me@@ tal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent is made of al@@ um@@ in@@ um .
you see , even though al@@ um@@ in@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure me@@ tal .
it &apos;s all bo@@ und by oxygen and sili@@ c@@ ates .
but then the technology of electro@@ l@@ ysi@@ s came along and literally made al@@ um@@ in@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w-@@ away ment@@ ality .
so let &apos;s project this analo@@ gy going forward .
we think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , we are on a planet that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ watts of energy hi@@ ts the earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
it &apos;s not about being sc@@ ar@@ ce , it &apos;s about acc@@ es@@ sibility .
and there &apos;s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar-@@ gener@@ ated electricity is 50 percent that of di@@ es@@ el@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity in india -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six c@@ ents a kilo@@ watt hour compar@@ ed to 15 c@@ ents as a national average .
and if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ ya@@ ger spac@@ e@@ craft back towards the earth , in 199@@ 0 after it just passed satur@@ n ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there &apos;s nan@@ ot@@ ech@@ nolo@@ gy coming on , nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drin@@ king water a day out of any source -- sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two c@@ ents a li@@ ter .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will dep@@ lo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ power@@ ed by this technology , that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
my good@@ ness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ et@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
think about it , that a mas@@ a@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of ken@@ ya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re on a smar@@ t@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ un@@ dance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ ari@@ es of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of anno@@ un@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a@@ .@@ i@@ . , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequ@@ ences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ demi@@ c from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
i call it the ri@@ sing billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and by the way , the biggest prote@@ ction against a population explosion is making the world edu@@ cated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are conne@@ cting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they con@@ sume ? what will they desire ?
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic in@@ je@@ ction ever .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars in@@ je@@ cted into the global economy .
and they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better edu@@ cated by using the k@@ h@@ an aca@@ de@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d prin@@ ting and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more produ@@ ctive than ever before .
so what could three billion ri@@ sing , healthy , edu@@ cated , produ@@ ctive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed , wh@@ er@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predi@@ ct ?
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams dri@@ ven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpo@@ ra@@ tions and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ di@@ t .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ at@@ tle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequ@@ ence of am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it fol@@ ds di@@ ct@@ ates its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ er@@ y is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an execu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ ha@@ b clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ power@@ ed as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al technology .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ p@@ ist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ sti@@ ge to be able to do that .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of bas@@ e@@ ball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
we all love bas@@ e@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?
bas@@ e@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great bas@@ e@@ ball team .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bats 300 .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted saf@@ ely , hit saf@@ ely three times out of 10 at bats .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hi@@ tter in major lea@@ gue bas@@ e@@ ball ?
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 bas@@ e@@ ball hi@@ tter ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times saf@@ ely out of every 10 .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as in ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue bas@@ e@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular seas@@ on .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more com@@ fort@@ able , or perhaps a bit less com@@ fort@@ able after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surgeon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ de@@ ct@@ omi@@ es .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a lo@@ ved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor re@@ fers that lo@@ ved one to a car@@ di@@ olo@@ gist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
and she &apos;s hi@@ tting a 2@@ 5@@ 7 .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ dia@@ c surgeon or a nurse practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surgeon , an ob@@ g@@ y@@ n , a par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mi@@ sta@@ ke , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and that was the message that i ab@@ sor@@ bed when i was in med school .
i was an ob@@ ses@@ sive comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
and so i did .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; resi@@ dence at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
and i memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my anat@@ omy class the ori@@ g@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every mu@@ sc@@ le , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ ter@@ y that came off the aor@@ ta , differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar aci@@ do@@ sis .
and all the while , i was am@@ as@@ sing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i came out of medical school with the im@@ pression that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mi@@ stakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ cker .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working .
at the time i was as@@ signed to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology con@@ su@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and when i listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both si@@ des that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart fail@@ ure .
this is a condi@@ tion in which the heart fa@@ ils , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of bre@@ ath .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i gave her as@@ pi@@ r@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water pil@@ ls , to get her to pe@@ e out the access fluid .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mi@@ sta@@ ke ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mi@@ stakes .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ ni@@ sh addi@@ tional information about her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to cont@@ act him .
the second mi@@ sta@@ ke that i made was worse .
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said very mat@@ ter-@@ o@@ f-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so i signed the di@@ sch@@ ar@@ ge pa@@ pers , and an am@@ bu@@ lance came , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came to take her home .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that after@@ no@@ on , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my st@@ om@@ ach .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ ked up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know dre@@ ad .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergen@@ cy medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nurse asked mat@@ ter-@@ o@@ f-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arri@@ ved home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
and she was bar@@ ely breathing and she was blue .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staff pulled out all the st@@ ops .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ a@@ ster , because after they stabi@@ li@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had ir@@ rever@@ sible brain damage .
and the family gather@@ ed .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they re@@ signed themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grand@@ mother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with that .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , is@@ ol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible disc@@ us@@ sions , but at the end of it all that si@@ ck feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mi@@ sta@@ ke again .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mi@@ sta@@ ke again .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the un@@ healthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so si@@ ck inside .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what i was feeling .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ oth@@ ed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mi@@ sta@@ ke ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but sur@@ ely , it li@@ fted .
i began to feel a bit better .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
and i made myself a bar@@ ga@@ in that if only i re@@ double my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mi@@ sta@@ ke again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emergen@@ cy department at a community hospital just north of tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
it was bu@@ sy , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit pin@@ k .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ i@@ c@@ il@@ lin and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shift , and that &apos;s when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ et@@ ly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
he had a poten@@ tially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condi@@ tion called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ ti@@ s .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he was plac@@ ed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
and i went through the same period of shame and re@@ cri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emergen@@ cy shift , i mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
one i thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
i or@@ der@@ ed a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my col@@ lea@@ gue who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ r@@ ant and called the surge@@ ons .
the other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
i or@@ der@@ ed some flu@@ i@@ ds to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my col@@ lea@@ gue to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ r@@ ant , called the surge@@ ons .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mi@@ stakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
some of my do@@ o@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
alone , as@@ ham@@ ed and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mi@@ stakes , if i can &apos;t find the st@@ ill@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about fail@@ ure after fail@@ ure after fail@@ ure ?
oh yeah , you go to a co@@ ck@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mi@@ stakes .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my col@@ lea@@ ges and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye cont@@ act with that person .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete deni@@ al of mi@@ stakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mi@@ stakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mi@@ stakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ casting and journali@@ sm , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything i can , from one of the first arti@@ cles i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qui@@ t@@ ous .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospi@@ tal@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
in this country , as many as 2@@ 4,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ g@@ ged it at 100,000 .
in both cases , these are gross under@@ est@@ im@@ ates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
and here &apos;s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ va@@ sive .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ ru@@ l@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on their bre@@ ath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mi@@ stakes are ine@@ vi@@ table .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mi@@ sta@@ ke , &quot; i would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs to the chi@@ ef of car@@ dia@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mi@@ sta@@ ke , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mi@@ sta@@ ke i did . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
the re@@ defined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mi@@ stakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mi@@ stakes .
and she points out other people &apos;s mi@@ stakes , not in a got@@ cha way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mi@@ stakes from time to time .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easi@@ er to detect those mi@@ stakes that humans ine@@ vit@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mi@@ stakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mi@@ stakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
i am a re@@ defined physician .
i &apos;m human . i make mi@@ stakes .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shi@@ fting bas@@ eline .
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and you &apos;d think he was ch@@ as@@ ing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish .
and he descri@@ bed one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
a big fi@@ sher@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illu@@ stra@@ te another concept , is called shi@@ fting wai@@ st@@ line .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convin@@ ced that i was really not from there .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ me@@ ters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
and the fi@@ sher@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in ghana .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ unk to half of their size .
they were mat@@ uring at five centi@@ me@@ ters .
they had been pus@@ h@@ ed gene@@ ti@@ cally .
there were still fi@@ shes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fi@@ sher@@ s and this bo@@ at , quite u@@ gly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and i went sa@@ iling on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the south@@ ern south china sea and especially the ja@@ v@@ a sea .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were cor@@ al re@@ ef fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
within a year , you do a sur@@ v@@ ey and then commercial fishing beg@@ ins .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft cor@@ al into a mu@@ d@@ dy mess .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually colle@@ cted by fi@@ sher@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fi@@ shed .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t re@@ call what was there .
if you gener@@ ali@@ ze this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or natur@@ ally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward .
and the difference then , they per@@ cei@@ ve as a loss .
but they don &apos;t per@@ cei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
you can have a su@@ c@@ c@@ ession of changes .
at the end you want to susta@@ in miser@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affe@@ cted people certainly when in pre@@ dat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few gener@@ ations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant , before it gets extin@@ ct , it becomes r@@ are .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals .
you always lose r@@ are animals .
and therefore they &apos;re not per@@ cei@@ ved as a big loss .
over time , we con@@ cent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and@@ -@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed by fi@@ sher@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a mar@@ ine prote@@ cted area can play .
because with mar@@ ine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ cei@@ ve because the bas@@ eline has shi@@ fted and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a mar@@ ine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the insight that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ eline .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
this is a simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar . &quot;
and if you think about &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the ima@@ gery ?
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for cam@@ er@@ on to do &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar i@@ i &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the 198@@ 0s in the comm@@ un@@ ist eastern ger@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
you had to regi@@ ster a sample she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attac@@ ks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
we have three main groups .
we have online cri@@ min@@ als .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mi@@ try gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of ki@@ e@@ v in u@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ air@@ es online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attac@@ ks .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form tar@@ tu in est@@ oni@@ a .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
this is stephen watt .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n sun@@ din .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ lo@@ g@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the swi@@ ss bank accoun@@ t of mr. sam ja@@ in right here , and that bank accoun@@ t had 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victi@@ m of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the maj@@ ority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not mo@@ tiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re mo@@ tiv@@ ated by something else -- mo@@ tiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by an opinion , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
groups like anon@@ ym@@ ous have ri@@ sen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attac@@ ks .
so those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anon@@ ym@@ ous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in di@@ gin@@ ot@@ ar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
di@@ gin@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ tifi@@ cate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
somebody bro@@ ke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government repres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the di@@ gin@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
well di@@ gin@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a .
they sell cer@@ tifi@@ c@@ ates .
what do you do with cer@@ tifi@@ c@@ ates ?
well you need a cer@@ tifi@@ cate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ mail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ ali@@ t@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their disc@@ us@@ sions .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ tifi@@ c@@ ates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of di@@ gin@@ ot@@ ar .
what about ar@@ ab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ ypti@@ an secret police in a@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .
among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ tled &quot; fin@@ fi@@ sher . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in ger@@ many which had sold the eg@@ ypti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ ypti@@ an government .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ ali@@ t@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in ger@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
if you are a su@@ spe@@ ct in a cri@@ minal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online disc@@ us@@ sions , to collect your pass@@ words .
now when we think de@@ e@@ per about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .
why should i worry ?
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
priv@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were manu@@ f@@ ac@@ tu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fix@@ ed meas@@ u@@ rement that fit together .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this .
it was called the autom@@ atic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ seh@@ old .
it &apos;s est@@ im@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful hou@@ ses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
le@@ go made it acc@@ es@@ sible .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be anno@@ un@@ ced , the next building block .
the transi@@ stor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ stor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engine@@ ers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts .
let me show you how they work .
litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts are electronic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sens@@ ors .
and the best part about it is they s@@ na@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , pin@@ k is in@@ put and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is s@@ na@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts is that it &apos;s a growing libr@@ ary .
we want to make every single inter@@ action in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ es@@ sible .
we &apos;ve been giving litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from every@@ day that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an i@@ po@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been taking litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts to design schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have geor@@ die making ...
a few weeks ago we took litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion-@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of pla@@ y@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
to these non-@@ engine@@ ers , litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material acc@@ es@@ sible to everyone .
so litt@@ le@@ bi@@ ts is open-@@ source .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
we want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of invent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
so go ahead and start invent@@ ing .
thank you .
