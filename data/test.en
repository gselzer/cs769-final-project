one day , los angel@@ es times col@@ um@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angel@@ es when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with rob@@ ert dow@@ ney j@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined double b@@ ass@@ ist whose promis@@ ing career was cut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel dropped out of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete bre@@ ak@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angel@@ es .
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that b@@ ond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert h@@ all .
he had just heard a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the dod@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first viol@@ in pas@@ sage work in the last movement of be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a viol@@ in less@@ on with me .
now , i should men@@ tion that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therap@@ y and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then dis@@ appe@@ aring for days , w@@ ander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first less@@ on at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert h@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven viol@@ in concer@@ to .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into understanding , a quie@@ t curiosity and gra@@ ce .
and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own viol@@ in and he started playing , by e@@ ar , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of viol@@ in concer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ so@@ hn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ bel@@ i@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach to be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ รณ@@ k , all the way up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ onen .
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spo@@ ke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angel@@ es phil@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angel@@ es to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , brilliant , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined musi@@ cian .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tor@@ ment@@ ed state .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emo@@ tions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emo@@ tions into reality .
and the reality of that expression rea@@ ches all of us and moves us , in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ ites us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert h@@ all or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
rob@@ ert gu@@ p@@ ta .
rob@@ ert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from c@@ elli@@ sts .
so , please for@@ give me .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a best@@ s@@ eller on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ raised to the supposed high@@ est standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us che@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fis@@ h@@ ing the seas like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the de@@ stru@@ ction .
n@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it : fish far@@ ms poll@@ ute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one po@@ und of farm tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t poll@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ rated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you fee@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable prot@@ ein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken pel@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , sc@@ r@@ aps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percent@@ age of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fee@@ ding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , goo@@ d@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es fo@@ o@@ die .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in sou@@ th@@ ern spa@@ in .
a journal@@ ist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
like twice over .
ama@@ zingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the argent@@ ini@@ ans .
they raised bee@@ f cat@@ tle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
they built this in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they p@@ ush@@ ed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
and ec@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ chas@@ ed the land .
what did they do ?
they re@@ ver@@ sed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of p@@ ush@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 000-@@ acre fish farm -- b@@ ass , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely re@@ ver@@ sed the ec@@ ological de@@ stru@@ ction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you st@@ are out at a hori@@ zon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this thi@@ ck , rich mar@@ s@@ hl@@ and .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
okay ? there we are slo@@ g@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my kne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly condu@@ cting a biology lec@@ ture .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare black@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dered ki@@ te .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tioning the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , here he se@@ es a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mik@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aqu@@ a@@ tic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom@@ ass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fee@@ ds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght : thousands and thousands of pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al pin@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , pin@@ k .
they &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? i was totally conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ari@@ es in all of europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
he said , &quot; we farm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely , not intensi@@ vely .
this is an ec@@ ological network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no ki@@ dding .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the pengu@@ ins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a wh@@ it@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t men@@ tion the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ; i don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , i don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , t@@ ar-@@ like fla@@ vor .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in sou@@ th@@ ern spa@@ in , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted swe@@ et and clean , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last de@@ fen@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ statement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de r@@ un@@ off .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean@@ er than when it ent@@ ered .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
you might say it &apos;s a recip@@ e for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or bee@@ f cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new conc@@ eption of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radi@@ cal .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gros@@ s ine@@ qualities in distribution , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s deter@@ min@@ ed the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , che@@ mic@@ als to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re fee@@ ding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ ological capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ke@@ t is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources .
not by the lat@@ est com@@ bine and tra@@ ctor invention , but by fer@@ tile land ; not by pump@@ s , but by fres@@ h water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fis@@ h@@ ing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ ological model .
that &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely instead of just intensi@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers , but exper@@ ts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are exper@@ ts in fla@@ vor , too .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of de@@ a@@ ths -- say , accidents .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
this is because , in the mid-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual suspe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ str@@ ated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
you can jum@@ p right into a specific issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appeared in this issue , the spor@@ ts .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
so i can step back , and expand on that .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mon@@ d now .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ ader , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we redu@@ ced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ c@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sel@@ ect government .
now , having selec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ ined within any one wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bos@@ s -- and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can go , jum@@ p , and take a look at all the ted prize winn@@ ers .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of ab@@ stra@@ ction .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by surprise .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , po@@ p right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fr@@ ames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just launch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor rep@@ ur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
and , instead of de@@ aling just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fi@@ ction .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and sa@@ tis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curiosity that i had .
and you know , that curiosity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the micros@@ cope .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limit@@ s of possibility .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mi@@ r@@ r@@ ored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
j@@ ac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
so , that seemed to res@@ onate with the whole science fi@@ ction part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this satur@@ ation of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class dood@@ ling behind the text@@ book .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the j@@ ac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a s@@ cu@@ b@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in can@@ ada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a s@@ cu@@ b@@ a class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a ym@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absol@@ ute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i ch@@ ose a career as an ad@@ ult , it was film@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly dra@@ wing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i ch@@ ose to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ s@@ s . &quot;
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ ature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated ani@@ ma@@ tion , c@@ g .
and this resul@@ ted in the first so@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g ani@@ ma@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur cl@@ ar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suffi@@ ci@@ ently advan@@ ced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
they were seeing something ma@@ gi@@ cal .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ ma@@ tic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with il@@ m , we created the li@@ qu@@ id metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , dra@@ wing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the premi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analo@@ g process@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 90s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually fo@@ unded the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ ush@@ ed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this ep@@ ic roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; titanic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
and i talked them into fund@@ ing an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real titanic through a view p@@ ort .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build camer@@ as and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enorm@@ ous planning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fi@@ ction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation .
of course , the curiosity , the science comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was everything . it was ad@@ venture , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that h@@ oll@@ ywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expe@@ di@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
so , i was completely s@@ mit@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a h@@ oll@@ ywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these and we wo@@ und up going to the bis@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles .
we went back to the titanic w@@ re@@ ck .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of titanic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of titanic .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blue@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ v@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is in@@ je@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of exist@@ ence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a glimp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .
so , having done these expe@@ di@@ tions , and really beginning to app@@ reci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
they live in an environment of chem@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fi@@ ction influence , as a kid .
and i wo@@ und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russia , going through the pre-@@ cos@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i wo@@ und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
so , here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i &apos;d completely clos@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the science fi@@ ction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn &apos;t really learn about lea@@ der@@ ship until i did these expe@@ di@@ tions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no f@@ ame in it .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
made all these fil@@ ms , made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very limited audience .
no f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly kn@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in com@@ bat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a b@@ ond , creates a b@@ ond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same princi@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ ship , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory , doing &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ ora . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthesi@@ ze out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
i have young film@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t be@@ t against yourself , and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
nasa has this p@@ hr@@ ase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in explor@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
and no important ende@@ a@@ vor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those ris@@ ks .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vacc@@ ines and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deli@@ ver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their c@@ rop@@ s won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that lea@@ ds to starvation , it lea@@ ds to un@@ certain@@ ty , it lea@@ ds to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advan@@ ced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ eled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id decl@@ ine in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constra@@ int , and that constra@@ int has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that lea@@ ds to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase lea@@ ds to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ re@@ ct effects , in that the natural ec@@ osystems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ oxi@@ de every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rap@@ i@@ dly ris@@ ing to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four factors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ bra , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ comp@@ asses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street l@@ amp@@ s .
now , effici@@ ency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various in@@ ven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fer@@ tili@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you bur@@ n coal , no .
if you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emer@@ ging ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle .
so , the people here have parti@@ cip@@ ated in the creation of many mira@@ cles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stra@@ tion , some demon@@ stra@@ tion that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rel@@ eas@@ ing fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelie@@ vable scale and unbelie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many dire@@ ctions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fu@@ sion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning fossi@@ l fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning coal or bur@@ ning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the fl@@ ue , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
now we have some pil@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percent@@ age , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of vol@@ u@@ me .
so that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly reg@@ ul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weap@@ ons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
so three very t@@ ough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able sour@@ ces .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
one is that the den@@ si@@ ty of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is drama@@ tically less than a power plant .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent sour@@ ces .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t blo@@ w all the time .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sour@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
and , to dimen@@ si@@ on@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for fl@@ ash@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the appro@@ a@@ ches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gros@@ s has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ od k@@ hos@@ la &apos;s invest@@ ing in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mo@@ du@@ lar , li@@ qu@@ id .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of ter@@ r@@ ap@@ o@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s bur@@ n the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost profile .
you actually bur@@ n up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s reac@@ tors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ thes this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a traveling wa@@ ve reactor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire life@@ time of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
so , the other grade is : are we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we dep@@ lo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these effici@@ ency meas@@ ures to start getting redu@@ ctions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big redu@@ ctions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these bre@@ ak@@ through@@ s .
these bre@@ ak@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pil@@ ot projects , reg@@ ul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be disc@@ ussed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vacc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research fund@@ ing .
when countries get together in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative appro@@ a@@ ches .
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this di@@ alo@@ gue be a more rational , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ alo@@ gue , including the ste@@ ps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ r@@ ap@@ o@@ wer , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
bi@@ l g@@ ates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an reactor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the t@@ ough thing is building the pil@@ ot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the reg@@ ul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ si@@ ty , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and it just si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by reac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reac@@ tors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re redu@@ cing the vol@@ u@@ me of the waste quite drama@@ tically as you &apos;re going through this process .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possi@@ bilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t pi@@ cked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clos@@ ure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ tary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important adv@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , ter@@ r@@ ap@@ o@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortun@@ ately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fund@@ ing for their pil@@ ot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
b@@ g : an energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental constra@@ int , but the environmental constra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ du@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radi@@ ation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temperature of the earth st@@ able ?
b@@ g : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geo@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
climate skep@@ tics : if you had a sent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different camp@@ s .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
you make the mista@@ ke now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a ga@@ in later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 constra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll acc@@ ept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that drama@@ tic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reason@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to f@@ und that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fest@@ yle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more disc@@ ussed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associ@@ ated with the skep@@ tic cam@@ p , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appro@@ pri@@ ate .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fund@@ ed .
well bill , i suspe@@ ct i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
b@@ g : thank you .
several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , one y@@ ard of t@@ ape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ sho@@ p .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exer@@ cise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collabor@@ ation , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , norm@@ ally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sticks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collap@@ se .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are re@@ cent gradu@@ ates of business school .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are re@@ cent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build pro@@ totyp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve pro@@ totyp@@ es , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build pro@@ totyp@@ es along the way .
designers recognize this type of collabor@@ ation as the essen@@ ce of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in pro@@ totyp@@ e is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams per@@ form .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adul@@ ts .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , than@@ k@@ fully .
thir@@ ty-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building st@@ able structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of fac@@ ili@@ tation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
speci@@ alized skills and fac@@ ili@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typ@@ ically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
we did the exer@@ cise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of pro@@ totyp@@ ing .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and process@@ es to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identi@@ fy the hidden as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
because , fran@@ k@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right pro@@ totyp@@ e .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exer@@ cise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s step@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ weak and ad@@ just the system .
there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
and the fundamental less@@ on , i believe , is that design truly is a cont@@ act sport .
it demand@@ s that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little pro@@ totyp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , te@@ d-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were autom@@ o@@ bil@@ es or twi@@ tter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that crow@@ d , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
it &apos;s because possi@@ bilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , decl@@ ining rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents p@@ ush@@ ed that number to 70 .
my parents are clos@@ ing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
sm@@ all@@ po@@ x . sm@@ all@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
it res@@ h@@ ap@@ ed the demo@@ graphy of the glo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hard@@ ly .
di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a , poli@@ o ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vacc@@ ines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific me@@ thod .
and to my mind , the scientific me@@ thod -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
that number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rap@@ i@@ dly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this glo@@ be .
pot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journal@@ ist .
we type , we fi@@ le , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , edu@@ cated people , de@@ cent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weap@@ ons of mass de@@ stru@@ ction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skep@@ tical .
ask questions , dem@@ and pro@@ of , dem@@ and evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to acc@@ ept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epide@@ mic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that lin@@ ked the epide@@ mic of autis@@ m to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a vacc@@ ine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from can@@ ada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messa@@ ges of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link cau@@ sation and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a her@@ o , j@@ on@@ as sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . poli@@ o -- pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vacc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vacc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
what about poli@@ o ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vacc@@ in@@ ate her kid against poli@@ o , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have poli@@ o . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have poli@@ o in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to at@@ tend one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ oxi@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
i know you did because half of americ@@ ans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
i &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we ha@@ te big phar@@ ma .
we ha@@ te big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system su@@ cks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely aston@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ tary of hh@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; hm@@ m , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on mammo@@ grams , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ k@@ i south africa .
he killed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ root , gar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on oil were much more effective than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of nee@@ d@@ less de@@ a@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ sequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epide@@ mic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic el@@ ite .
it &apos;s an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every gra@@ in of rice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the gar@@ den of e@@ den .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many che@@ mic@@ als , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for inst@@ ance .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a pot@@ a@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it su@@ cks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prot@@ ein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we figh@@ ting it ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we figh@@ ting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about che@@ mic@@ als .
it &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
this isn &apos;t about rice kris@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech coloni@@ al@@ ism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this ama@@ zingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is belie@@ ved in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , su@@ gar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic tri@@ ck .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a tri@@ ck that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ fe .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ ck@@ ery . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
so , this is a tri@@ ck that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ eption by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple tri@@ ck metho@@ d@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally .
probably many of you in the room know this tri@@ ck .
what happens is this .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illu@@ sion .
in a moment when my hand moves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
and we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my finger .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
there is a tri@@ ck you can do for your friends and neighbor@@ s . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an aston@@ ishing thing .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in shaped -- it &apos;s just a ro@@ und white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical -- they &apos;re su@@ gar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
a col@@ ored cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
d@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ rin@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ je@@ ct this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ d@@ le .
and none of it has any real phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic tri@@ ck .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ inch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just steri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a h@@ oll@@ ywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to pier@@ ce my skin and run this nee@@ d@@ le through to the other side .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pier@@ ce .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe tri@@ ck .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not dum@@ b enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satelli@@ te room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a h@@ oll@@ ywood special effect .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can twi@@ st that around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ e@@ ding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
norm@@ ally now , i would take the nee@@ d@@ le out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wa@@ ve of interest in happiness , among resear@@ ch@@ ers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tr@@ aps .
this appli@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it appli@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might re@@ stri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different conc@@ ep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the foc@@ using illu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ cum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he added , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor appro@@ a@@ ches -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hur@@ t now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that keeps sc@@ ore , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor appro@@ a@@ ches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ dur@@ e .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ copy than patient b .
the stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a dire@@ ct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clin@@ ical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ copy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward : they are lost for@@ ever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self keeps for us .
so we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be ch@@ osen .
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future norm@@ ally as experiences .
we think of our future as anti@@ cip@@ ated memor@@ ies .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
i have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in antar@@ c@@ tica a few years ago , which was clearly the best v@@ ac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it rela@@ tively often , rela@@ tive to how much i think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory rela@@ tive to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two conc@@ ep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emo@@ tions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crow@@ d of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in re@@ cent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
the g@@ all@@ up organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
so in re@@ cent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main less@@ on i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how sa@@ tis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice vers@@ a .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
we know something about what contro@@ ls sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maxi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not at@@ tend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the cor@@ re@@ ct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refle@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how horrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that g@@ all@@ up survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the g@@ all@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americ@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very large s@@ ample of americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative s@@ ample -- below an income of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year ...
6@@ 0,000 .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gressi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
above that , we get an absolutely fl@@ at line .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so fl@@ at .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but l@@ ack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold for emo@@ tions .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american ende@@ a@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politi@@ cians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inv@@ enting behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ g@@ on@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ a@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the op@@ posi@@ te is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total drama@@ tically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portra@@ it by a photo@@ grapher named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the emo@@ tion of g@@ aming , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classi@@ c g@@ aming emo@@ tion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but inten@@ se concent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on tac@@ kl@@ ing a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ kle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of opti@@ mis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an ep@@ ic win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an ep@@ ic win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an ep@@ ic win .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neighbor@@ hood in ber@@ kel@@ ey , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to cooper@@ ate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a gradu@@ ate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make ep@@ ic wins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are willing to trust you with a world-@@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your ep@@ ic mission .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and also there is this ep@@ ic story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us-@@ one str@@ ength , and pl@@ us-@@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of const@@ ant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us-@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us-@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so sa@@ tis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , colle@@ cti@@ vely all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ liest pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently invest@@ ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magni@@ tu@@ de of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 2@@ 1 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states 1@@ 0,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be virtu@@ os@@ os at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ os@@ os at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent opti@@ mis@@ m .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation .
ur@@ gent opti@@ mis@@ m is the des@@ ire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , combined with the belief that we have a reason@@ able hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ os@@ os at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ric .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ adly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result .
bli@@ ss@@ ful productivity . i love it .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : ep@@ ic meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
second biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 articles , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ k@@ i .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
they are building an ep@@ ic story .
they are building an ep@@ ic knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ unts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stron@@ ger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
these are an@@ cient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
before we had awesome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the an@@ cient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the kingdom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were figh@@ ting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and immer@@ se us in such sa@@ tis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful productivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to escape re@@ al-@@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not sa@@ tis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
they divi@@ ded the entire kingdom in half .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the winn@@ ers of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic ad@@ venture .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ c@@ ans , who then led to the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the an@@ cient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest@@ ed that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually sa@@ ved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually sa@@ ved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
that was the first re@@ al-@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ voted my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case sc@@ en@@ ario out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
we want to imagine ep@@ ic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the ep@@ ic win .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to give people the means to create ep@@ ic wins in their own fu@@ tures .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news , videos , data fee@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil co@@ sts , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transpor@@ tation is being affected , if schools are clos@@ ed , if there is ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a trans@@ forma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic ad@@ venture and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and ad@@ venture for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our play@@ ers have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
so , for the next world-@@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher : bigger problem than just pe@@ ak oil .
we did a game called super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
and the pre@@ mis@@ e was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the global ex@@ tin@@ ction a@@ war@@ en@@ ess system , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the a@@ stron@@ au@@ t , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are invi@@ ting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
i would like to invi@@ te all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
so , i &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have sa@@ ved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ ss@@ ful productivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ric , this feeling of ur@@ gent opti@@ mis@@ m and the des@@ ire for ep@@ ic meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , i say : let the world-@@ changing games begin .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
i always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
let me read you the ent@@ ry .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ je@@ ctive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ re@@ cked , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ unded , man@@ gl@@ ed , l@@ ame , mu@@ til@@ ated , r@@ un-@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , wea@@ ken@@ ed , imp@@ ot@@ ent , ca@@ str@@ ated , paraly@@ zed , han@@ dic@@ apped , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ i@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cra@@ ck@@ e@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hur@@ t , us@@ eless and weak .
ant@@ ony@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i was reading this list out lou@@ d to a friend and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and colle@@ ct myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the ass@@ au@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an an@@ cient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , nee@@ d@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ au@@ rus back then .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online e@@ dition , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
here &apos;s the up@@ dated version of this ent@@ ry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ se@@ tt@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many an@@ cient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , belie@@ ved that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out lou@@ d brought it into exist@@ ence .
so , what reality do we want to call into exist@@ ence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting shado@@ ws on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
one such person who open@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.@@ i@@ . du@@ pon@@ t institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , del@@ aware .
his name was dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an itali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americ@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exc@@ eption of my physical therap@@ y s@@ essi@@ ons .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these thi@@ ck , el@@ astic band@@ s -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these band@@ s more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my s@@ ession -- ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essi@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . a@@ i@@ me@@ e , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those band@@ s .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pros@@ pe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est fi@@ ve-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ h@@ ape an aw@@ ful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his decl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adul@@ ts in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
but , in the previous inst@@ an@@ ces of those thes@@ au@@ rus ent@@ ri@@ es , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , laser surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ ani@@ um kne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limit@@ s that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identi@@ fy , to cla@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global groups of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest as@@ set .
the human ability to adap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ versi@@ ty , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this p@@ hr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
imp@@ lic@@ it in this p@@ hr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ versi@@ ty &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a challenging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or cir@@ cum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pros@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ad@@ versi@@ ty isn &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my shado@@ w .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s strug@@ gle .
there is ad@@ versi@@ ty and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rela@@ tive to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ versi@@ ty , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ versi@@ ty , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to adap@@ t .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive soc@@ ie@@ tal opinion of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defini@@ tions .
in our des@@ ire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ gn@@ osis , or , indeed , a pro@@ gn@@ osis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their pot@@ ency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural strug@@ gle they might have .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those percei@@ ved de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avo@@ id or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wr@@ apped in the ad@@ versi@@ ty .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versi@@ ty as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ versi@@ ty as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
this year we cele@@ bra@@ te the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illu@@ str@@ ated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , n@@ or is it the most intelli@@ gent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is driven by the strug@@ gle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ versi@@ ty gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ versi@@ ty as something more than just t@@ ough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
ad@@ versi@@ ty is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest ad@@ versi@@ ty that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exi@@ sted ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or pot@@ ency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can rel@@ ease the power of so many more children , and invi@@ te them to engage their rare and valu@@ able abilities with the community .
anthrop@@ ologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ jury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valu@@ able .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ sylvania , and i was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t a@@ i@@ me@@ e mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my bir@@ th@@ day by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who delivered me was a complete str@@ an@@ ger to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la bones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ an@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ gn@@ osis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , winning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my spor@@ ts vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and inte@@ gr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ gn@@ osis can accoun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a deter@@ min@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ c@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pros@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have open@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast shado@@ ws on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are edu@@ c@@ ating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; edu@@ c@@ ate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s bri@@ tain , when they were moving from gram@@ mar schools to comprehen@@ sive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tra@@ cking &quot; here in the states .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ g@@ her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
and , of course , the hear@@ t@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
those who were still around in school , besi@@ des the people who had dropped out .
a cru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ ush@@ ed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ ush@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curiosity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
if instead , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ century per@@ si@@ an poet named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , j@@ ac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you . how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more precise , more accurate and quick@@ er .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stron@@ ger , with more stam@@ ina .
would you like to be more attra@@ ctive and self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent ?
how about living longer with good health ?
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about fit@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vity ?
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
the great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ k@@ y , who was also a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say that he tit@@ led &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not acc@@ ept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ yn sch@@ ul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
but if you do acc@@ ept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all dire@@ ctions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolu@@ tionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demonstr@@ ated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we bran@@ ch off of a common an@@ c@@ est@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about 1@@ 30,000 years .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can take advantage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machin@@ ery of a common bacter@@ ium to produce the prot@@ ein of human insu@@ l@@ in used to treat di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics ?
this is not like human insu@@ l@@ in ; this is the same prot@@ ein that is che@@ mic@@ ally indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ri@@ es in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dam@@ asi@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hos@@ pit@@ able environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the oc@@ c@@ asi@@ onal inter@@ ruption of the un@@ intended forced r@@ ush to the ex@@ it .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolu@@ tionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organis@@ ms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emer@@ ging in the last 1@@ 30,000 years .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
that was us .
that also con@@ stit@@ utes the enter@@ tainment por@@ tion of this talk , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
now when i was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i became en@@ am@@ ored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the exist@@ ence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organis@@ ms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organis@@ ms come online , things start to change .
sexual re@@ production ent@@ ers the picture .
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production that pass@@ es on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
in fact , you could say that the ine@@ vit@@ ability of the death of our bodies ent@@ ers in evolu@@ tionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ gradu@@ ate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reason@@ able at the time , but with each pass@@ ing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of george bur@@ ns , who was per@@ forming still in las v@@ eg@@ as well into his 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
he answers the door .
standing before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to realize , as a physi@@ cian , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , just different .
i was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about pass@@ ing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
from an evolu@@ tionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the sea .
i think we would all understand the sen@@ ti@@ ment that woo@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily fa@@ vor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fa@@ vor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
that is the sol@@ e test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ c and can survive at the steam v@@ ent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that a hos@@ pit@@ able environment for them .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possi@@ bilities .
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
we have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
and the reason@@ ing behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figu@@ red our environment that we have managed to make it adap@@ t to us as well as we adap@@ t to it .
and by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gra@@ te and circu@@ late and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
and as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do coloni@@ ze dist@@ ant planets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and ch@@ osen by us as individuals in the cho@@ ices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making cho@@ ices about their off@@ spring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than fe@@ mal@@ es .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate diabetes or al@@ zhei@@ mer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or el@@ im@@ in@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ingly possible .
the human genome project started in 19@@ 90 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 000-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increas@@ ingly available for everyone .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering a@@ war@@ ded its dr@@ aper prize to fran@@ cis ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ m@@ mer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old call@@ s &quot; dire@@ cted evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was a@@ war@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ aka for his research in which he took an ad@@ ult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he indu@@ ced that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a pl@@ uri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell potenti@@ ally capable of becoming any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insu@@ l@@ in in bacteria can make vir@@ uses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce imm@@ un@@ ity against other vir@@ uses .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ent@@ al trial going on with vacc@@ ine against influ@@ en@@ za that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a to@@ b@@ acc@@ o plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ b@@ acc@@ o ?
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
what if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly fer@@ tili@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a health@@ ier life -- el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the diabetes , el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want health@@ ier children ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the quick twi@@ tch mus@@ cle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;ll take a process that norm@@ ally might require 100,000 years , and we can comp@@ ress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
these are cho@@ ices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
will we use these cho@@ ices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?
or , will we selec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we make a society that is more boring and more uni@@ form , or more robust and more ver@@ sa@@ tile ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to in@@ her@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ices wi@@ sel@@ y ?
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ices will be up to us .
thank you .
i want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir users up standing and walking again .
we at ber@@ kel@@ ey bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ os@@ kel@@ et@@ ons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra str@@ ength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for inst@@ ance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
but not only that -- it will inte@@ gra@@ te and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es , 30 percent of them -- chron@@ ic back in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ os@@ kel@@ et@@ on that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introduce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ os@@ kel@@ et@@ on , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
its flexi@@ ble design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ a@@ gi@@ li@@ ty movements .
it sen@@ ses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then aug@@ ments my str@@ ength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex@@ os@@ kel@@ et@@ on this year .
so this is for real .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people estim@@ ated to be in whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive estimate .
we are talking here about , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir &apos;s the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations -- is the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu@@ ction , i must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
let me now introduce you to ele@@ gs that is wor@@ n by am@@ anda box@@ tel that 19 years ago was spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
thank you .
am@@ anda is we@@ aring our ele@@ gs set .
it has sensors .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve , sensors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her kne@@ e jo@@ in@@ ts , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ oth and very natural ga@@ it .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
in a spli@@ t second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my pel@@ v@@ is .
not long afterwards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
he rob@@ bed every o@@ un@@ ce of hope from my being .
adap@@ tive technology has since enab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock clim@@ b and even hand@@ cycle .
but nothing has been invented that enab@@ les me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have disc@@ us@@ sions with you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
when i &apos;m not figh@@ ting poverty , i &apos;m figh@@ ting fir@@ es as the assi@@ st@@ ant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed career staff , you have to get to the fire sc@@ ene pretty early to get in on any action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the sc@@ ene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our assi@@ gn@@ ments would be .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the p@@ our@@ ing rain , under an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a , in her pa@@ jam@@ as , bar@@ e@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was st@@ un@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
here was some law@@ yer or money manag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five seconds .
well , i was next .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
he said , &quot; be@@ zo@@ s , i need you to go into the house .
i need you to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es . &quot;
i swe@@ ar .
so , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing for , but off i went -- up the sta@@ irs , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedro@@ om to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no her@@ o .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ cious dog by the front door .
we took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
the act of kin@@ dness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ figh@@ ter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achie@@ ved , or are on their way to achie@@ ving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . clean up a neighbor@@ hood park .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the sho@@ es .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hell@@ o , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn &apos;t bur@@ ning man or san francisco .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , meet your cou@@ s@@ ins .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gl@@ es of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clos@@ est rela@@ tive .
that means we all share a common an@@ c@@ est@@ or , an evolu@@ tionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well-@@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of this aspe@@ ct in our narra@@ tives of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated by big , scary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ mal@@ es .
these guys have really worked something out , since this lea@@ ds to a highly toler@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese j@@ ung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the con@@ go is a para@@ do@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the sc@@ ene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
not surpris@@ ingly , this de@@ stru@@ ction also en@@ danger@@ s bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
bus@@ h@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small sta@@ di@@ um with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ gh@@ ter s@@ wa@@ ying the trees .
who are these cou@@ s@@ ins ?
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ ex@@ ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing toler@@ ance .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increas@@ es creativity and res@@ ili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of conne@@ ctions .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolu@@ tionary roots of human lau@@ gh@@ ter , dance and ritu@@ al .
play is the gl@@ ue that bin@@ ds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fres@@ h from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i do not mean football .
so here , we have a young female and a male enga@@ ged in a ch@@ ase game .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
it might be the evolu@@ tionary orig@@ in of the p@@ hr@@ ase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the b@@ alls . &quot;
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ veness of bringing un@@ usual elements into play -- such as te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how play both requ@@ ires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
play &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quie@@ t , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is quie@@ tly playing with water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boun@@ dar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worlds .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the un@@ expected conne@@ ctions we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adap@@ t to an increas@@ ingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive wil@@ d@@ card .
in order to adap@@ t success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
play &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cla@@ w .
in times when it seems least appro@@ pri@@ ate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embra@@ ce this gi@@ ft from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ low@@ ship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day , at the ex@@ act same moment , each conc@@ ei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
so two cou@@ ples each conc@@ ei@@ ving one baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the conc@@ eption , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that conc@@ eption , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this sc@@ en@@ ario , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is car@@ rying a y chro@@ mos@@ ome , meeting that x chro@@ mos@@ ome of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is car@@ rying an x chro@@ mos@@ ome , meeting the x chro@@ mos@@ ome of the eg@@ g .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do .
as the one hat , i do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , conc@@ ep@@ ts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ joined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
so in one inst@@ ance , you can have somebody who has an x@@ y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chro@@ mos@@ ome tells the pro@@ to-@@ g@@ on@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ stes .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks rec@@ ep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and this is a syndro@@ me called andro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody fig@@ ures out something &apos;s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ vari@@ es inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ stes inside , and she has a y chro@@ mos@@ ome .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
fe@@ mal@@ es , like mal@@ es , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make andro@@ gens , which are a mas@@ cul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one .
most fe@@ mal@@ es like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ mal@@ es like me are actually andro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
we &apos;re making andro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to andro@@ gens .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more andro@@ gens than the woman born with te@@ stes who has andro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ vari@@ es and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asia .
he had x@@ x chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a mas@@ cul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were mas@@ cul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas@@ cul@@ ine comp@@ on@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspe@@ cted anything .
and it was only when he had re@@ ach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating inter@@ n@@ ally , that doctors figu@@ red out that , in fact , he was female inter@@ n@@ ally .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
some people who have x@@ x chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cu@@ lar tissue wr@@ apped around it .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ joined tw@@ inn@@ ing , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by sur@@ ge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social categories .
or system has been based typ@@ ically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identi@@ ty .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identi@@ ty ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simp@@ li@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ t@@ les us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
so we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ al@@ ism .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ al@@ ism .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african r@@ un@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ l@@ in .
i had a lot of journ@@ alists call@@ ing me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists there isn &apos;t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as st@@ able an@@ atom@@ ical categories that m@@ apped very simply to st@@ able identi@@ ty categories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simp@@ li@@ stic categories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simp@@ li@@ stic .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is bat@@ t@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions no@@ wa@@ days -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to strug@@ gle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t b@@ ury them yet .
if it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you b@@ ury them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organ@@ s out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to strug@@ gle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this lea@@ ds us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .
now you might think that all this bre@@ ak@@ ing-@@ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ f@@ end people with un@@ usual bodies , but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categories are really much more un@@ st@@ able than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first admit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radi@@ cal in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musi@@ cal &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radi@@ cal and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all re@@ call , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simp@@ li@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of bir@@ th@@ right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that mat@@ tered was the com@@ mon@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radi@@ cal thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a nat@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very va@@ gue concept of bir@@ th@@ right .
they were moving towards a nat@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the decl@@ ar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ vari@@ es is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; ain &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of color appe@@ aling to a com@@ mon@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y over a difference of an@@ atom@@ y , again , success@@ fully .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that com@@ mon@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
i don &apos;t want to say fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical di@@ visi@@ ons that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conc@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both conc@@ ei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
hen@@ ry , by contr@@ ast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 19@@ 80 .
simply by virtu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than hen@@ ry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drin@@ k .
hen@@ ry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
hen@@ ry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that hen@@ ry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
hen@@ ry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categories that per@@ s@@ ist that are in many ways proble@@ ma@@ tic and questi@@ on@@ able .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start falling apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ ma@@ tic at@@ titu@@ de : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chro@@ mos@@ ome , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chro@@ mos@@ ome .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es .
but this is also very bi@@ zar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about andro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab@@ rad@@ ors that i know that are more capable of in@@ formed , intelli@@ gent , mat@@ ure decisions about sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also w@@ on@@ ders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mri ?
do we really want to go there ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job strug@@ gl@@ ing with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ dered , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ joined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very b@@ adly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you consi@@ dered political as@@ y@@ l@@ um instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possi@@ bilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something a little bit radi@@ cal for a femin@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es in terms of the way they think and oper@@ ate in the world .
and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ mal@@ es , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ cl@@ ined to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when i was in gradu@@ ate school , one of my gradu@@ ate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in femin@@ ism -- i consi@@ dered myself a femin@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the dum@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
femin@@ ism is all about un@@ doing ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we in@@ je@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identi@@ ty , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is , i &apos;m out@@ fit@@ -@@ ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed .
i love finding , we@@ aring , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging a different , col@@ or@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stor@@ es .
aw@@ w , thank you .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing like my own personal tre@@ as@@ ure h@@ unt .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pan@@ ts and that &apos;s it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ f@@ its right now .
does that sound good ?
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have pi@@ cked up in these ad@@ vent@@ ures we@@ aring nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y tiger . &quot;
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
this whole out@@ fit , including the j@@ ac@@ ke@@ t , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
it is almost physi@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re we@@ aring bright red pan@@ ts .
if you are happy , you are going to attra@@ ct other happy people to you .
tu@@ es@@ day : fit@@ ting in is way over@@ rated .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surro@@ unding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will app@@ reci@@ ate it .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing dres@@ s-@@ up , or that i re@@ mind them of their se@@ ven@@ -year-old .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : con@@ fi@@ dence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
so there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m we@@ aring , and we &apos;ve had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
because the less@@ on i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , col@@ or@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good after@@ noon , everybody .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in ital@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you be@@ t your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two comp@@ on@@ ents -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating comp@@ on@@ ent .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been b@@ lan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electronics .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respon@@ d in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
just as an asi@@ de , i wanted to men@@ tion , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emis@@ sions .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is ent@@ ering our everyday objects .
that &apos;s from an ex@@ hibi@@ tion that pa@@ ola ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is organi@@ zing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ s@@ or and an actu@@ ator .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mos@@ es , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mos@@ es -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ รฉ n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in ital@@ y .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been dep@@ lo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous and aggre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 200@@ 6 .
it &apos;s when ital@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up .
some of you might remember , it was ital@@ y and france playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
and anyway , ital@@ y won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ oring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
it &apos;s morning , before the mat@@ ch .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , making call@@ s and moving .
the mat@@ ch beg@@ ins -- silence .
france sc@@ or@@ es . ital@@ y sc@@ or@@ es .
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
second half . end of normal time .
first over@@ time , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
ital@@ y wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to cele@@ bra@@ te in the center .
you saw the big pe@@ ak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co massi@@ m@@ o , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to cele@@ bra@@ te , to have a big par@@ ty , and you see the pe@@ ak at the end of the day .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ at@@ tle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would th@@ row away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
here are the results we just ob@@ ta@@ ined .
from se@@ at@@ tle ...
after one week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transpor@@ tation and con@@ vol@@ u@@ ted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t dis@@ appear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ oral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we disc@@ ussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that spa@@ in and sou@@ th@@ ern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a work@@ sho@@ p was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , t@@ aps , opening and clos@@ ing .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jum@@ p through , as you see in this image .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ lo@@ ch .
he liked it very much .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the ro@@ of also is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ h@@ ing , you can actually lower the ro@@ of .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will dis@@ appear , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the ro@@ of down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost dis@@ appe@@ ars .
here &apos;s the building working .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , te@@ sting the sensors that open the water .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jum@@ p without getting we@@ t .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predi@@ c@@ table .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a clou@@ d that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chr@@ ony .
so you can have this clou@@ d .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regu@@ lar con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation in two dimensions .
or in regu@@ lar , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d clou@@ d of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many dire@@ ctions .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regu@@ lar grid as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to b@@ ol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ ers -- the รฉ@@ to@@ ile at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
it &apos;s both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gra@@ vity and ro@@ tation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics .
it &apos;s called the clou@@ d .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call clou@@ d rais@@ ing -- like bar@@ n rais@@ ing , but with a clou@@ d .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digiti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that accessi@@ ble through the internet .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbo@@ l .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pres@@ sing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emis@@ sions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ cti@@ vely .
the clou@@ d is a clou@@ d , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real clou@@ d is a clou@@ d made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our clou@@ d is a clou@@ d of pi@@ x@@ els .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical clou@@ d in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ u@@ late that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
i first went to antar@@ c@@ tica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
i was in a@@ we .
my heart be@@ at fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to comp@@ re@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of glac@@ i@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they have a distinct way of inter@@ ac@@ ting with their environment and their experiences .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and c@@ rum@@ ble in a fit of drama@@ tic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re is@@ ol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i am brea@@ thing in its an@@ cient atmosphere .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rel@@ eas@@ ing miner@@ al-@@ rich fres@@ h water that n@@ our@@ ish@@ es many forms of life .
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancestors , kno@@ wing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
it &apos;s a very rare oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg roll@@ ing .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small bo@@ at .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot bo@@ at .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
you can see here , it beg@@ ins to roll , and the bo@@ at has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge-@@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
thank you .
i have had the distinct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est i ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
temp@@ t was one of the for@@ em@@ ost gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i artists in the 80s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
and that was the on@@ set of als .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
he only has use of his eyes .
i was ex@@ posed to him .
i have a company that does design and ani@@ ma@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i is defin@@ it@@ ely an in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to sp@@ ons@@ or tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen ha@@ w@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upper ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
these devices aren &apos;t accessi@@ ble to people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving b@@ ell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
so i showed up with the des@@ ire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to c@@ ash .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so i spo@@ ke at a conference a couple months after that .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexual organ@@ s , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush sl@@ ander@@ s and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a laser and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be awesome . &quot;
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things .
one , we batter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ sur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a stephen ha@@ w@@ king machine .
which was awesome .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven program@@ mers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these h@@ ack@@ ers and program@@ mers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ ori@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we program@@ med , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the e@@ ye@@ wri@@ ter , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap pa@@ ir of sun@@ gl@@ asses that we bought at the ven@@ ice beach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from home de@@ po@@ t and radio sh@@ ack .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , hac@@ ked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations .
there &apos;s no in@@ sur@@ ance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ vei@@ ling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of program@@ ming , carb@@ -@@ fest and all-@@ night s@@ essi@@ ons , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hospital .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the par@@ king lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f sc@@ ene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally re@@ ach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
so that &apos;s kind of our bat@@ tle c@@ ry .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stron@@ ger .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ck@@ ets .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ ored us as one of the top 50 in@@ ven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in ap@@ ri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ff@@ en mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angel@@ es , there &apos;s going to be an ex@@ hibi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad@@ -@@ asses of the street art sc@@ ene -- ban@@ ks@@ y , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ wri@@ ter -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cu@@ lar recogni@@ tion technology , but i just recogni@@ zed something and associ@@ ated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever ch@@ ose far@@ mer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and ep@@ i@@ ph@@ ani@@ es .
and you know , an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
i was the guy be@@ aten up bloo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher sa@@ ved my life .
she sa@@ ved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; lo@@ un@@ ge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a thum@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 80s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ pointed that we never got to know each other as adul@@ ts .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
and i should men@@ tion that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we took a look at her , we lau@@ gh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hos@@ pi@@ ce .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and wat@@ ched over her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an ad@@ ult got to know me , she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was placed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had clos@@ ed , it had become a circle -- and that ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any i talked about pres@@ ented itself .
the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
she sa@@ ved my life ; i and my partner sa@@ ved her@@ s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleas@@ ure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you clim@@ b through 3@@ ,000 ft .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
it sounds scary .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1@@ d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the pil@@ ot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pil@@ ot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
i could see in her eyes , it was terror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to men@@ d , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i colle@@ ct bad win@@ es . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
i no longer want to post@@ p@@ one anything in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real regre@@ t .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my own humanity and mista@@ kes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
and i regre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clo@@ ck starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please blo@@ w up . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ ari@@ es .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sa@@ d .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really fram@@ ed in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i was at a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic tal@@ ent ...
... yet .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
i realized at that point , by conne@@ cting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
i was given the gi@@ ft of a mira@@ cle , of not dying that day .
i was given another gi@@ ft , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here for@@ ever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weap@@ ons is the nat@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment fac@@ ili@@ ty .
the gray box@@ es that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
the gray box@@ es don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engine@@ er to con@@ figure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gray box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
i want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray box@@ es , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a dire@@ cted attack .
it &apos;s completely dire@@ cted .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gray box if a specific con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clo@@ ck , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in ger@@ many .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a s@@ ample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about -- around about 1@@ 5,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assem@@ bly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function call@@ s , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
so we do need target theor@@ ies that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
in order to get target theor@@ ies , we remember that it &apos;s defin@@ it@@ ely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bus@@ he@@ h@@ r nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ an@@ z fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
so i told my assi@@ st@@ ant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant exper@@ ts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
and i ph@@ oned them up and pi@@ cked their brain in an effort to mat@@ ch their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clos@@ ely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ an@@ z and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ c@@ ade , and each cas@@ c@@ ade holds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
so that made sense , that was a mat@@ ch .
and it even got better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost iden@@ tical structure .
so again , that was a real good mat@@ ch .
and this gave us very high con@@ fi@@ dence for what we were looking at .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been ob@@ ta@@ ined over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
anyway , so we figu@@ red out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gl@@ es .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ c@@ ade , and spinn@@ ing up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ cades and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves .
so in all , we are very con@@ fi@@ dent that we have actually deter@@ min@@ ed what the target is .
it is nat@@ an@@ z , and it is only nat@@ an@@ z .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ c@@ ep@@ ts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensors -- and it provi@@ des le@@ giti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ erec@@ or@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
so it &apos;s just like from the h@@ oll@@ ywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is fed with pr@@ erec@@ or@@ ded video .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressi@@ ve .
the idea is to cir@@ cum@@ v@@ ent a digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open rel@@ ie@@ f val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are com@@ promis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can blo@@ w up .
and nei@@ ther your oper@@ ators n@@ or your safety system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
think about this : this attack is gen@@ eric .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an autom@@ o@@ bile fac@@ tory .
it is gen@@ eric .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deli@@ ver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber weap@@ on of mass de@@ stru@@ ction .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environments .
we have to face the con@@ sequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
thanks .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ p@@ h , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that people as@@ su@@ me that mos@@ sa@@ d is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the mos@@ sa@@ d is involved , but that the le@@ ading force is not israel .
so the le@@ ading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortun@@ ately , fortun@@ ately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for scar@@ ing the living day@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ p@@ h .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situ@@ ations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i fil@@ med in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horrible situ@@ ations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine soc@@ ie@@ tal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them enter@@ ta@@ ining and accessi@@ ble to an audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand@@ ing and sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
i sent out some facebook messa@@ ges , some twi@@ tter messa@@ ges , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 20@@ 11 ted talk .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpor@@ ation , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ c@@ e-@@ in-@@ a-@@ life@@ time opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately blo@@ w up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
it &apos;s a lot .
that &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situ@@ ations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , where the entire film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to fin@@ ish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the@@ -@@ ti@@ tle sp@@ ons@@ or that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ di@@ um , the st@@ ap@@ les center ...
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- for@@ ever .
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , for@@ ever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . for@@ ever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand x ti@@ tle sp@@ ons@@ or , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drin@@ k you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to fin@@ ish .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
i don &apos;t know how rec@@ ep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; ang@@ le &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1.@@ 5 million .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a t@@ ough sell because of the film or a t@@ ough sell because of me ?
j@@ k : both .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which br@@ ands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with .@@ .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ record conversation . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly dis@@ appeared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
i was ama@@ zed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the m@@ asses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one f@@ at@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; rea@@ di@@ ly understood ; charac@@ teri@@ zed by visi@@ bility or accessi@@ bility of information , especially concer@@ ning business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
our politi@@ cians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is scary -- like that od@@ d , st@@ ill@@ -@@ scre@@ aming be@@ ar .
it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ c@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ k@@ y .
what else is ris@@ k@@ y ?
eating an entire bowl of cool whi@@ p .
that &apos;s very ris@@ k@@ y .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would cat@@ ch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agen@@ cy willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john b@@ ond and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ bau@@ m for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conver@@ sa@@ tions with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make great big , giant h@@ oll@@ ywood fil@@ ms , and i have friends who make little independent fil@@ ms like i make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant h@@ oll@@ ywood movies say the reason their fil@@ ms are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent fil@@ ms say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant h@@ oll@@ ywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so how speci@@ fically will we see ban in the film ?
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see ban de@@ od@@ or@@ ant .
while any@@ time i do an inter@@ view with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fres@@ h enough for this inter@@ view ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
so maybe you should put some one before the inter@@ view . &quot;
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fu@@ sion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
that &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the fi@@ ve-@@ cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
so we don &apos;t have the bu@@ d@@ gets that other br@@ ands have .
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
ban is b@@ lan@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
super@@ ior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
we talk about b@@ old , fres@@ h .
i think &quot; fres@@ h &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categ@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and we@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
it keeps you fres@@ h .
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ hn@@ ess , more fres@@ hn@@ ess , three times fres@@ her .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi@@ -@@ million dollar corpor@@ ation .
what about me ? what about a regu@@ lar guy ?
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regu@@ lar jo@@ es .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like really nice clothes .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ punk , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
unique .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , style i am would be like dark glam@@ or .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ory , like sun@@ gl@@ asses , or i like cr@@ y@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas@@ ual fly .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m the pe@@ t guy .
i sell pe@@ t toys all over the country , all over the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i deli@@ ver the goo@@ ds .
failed wri@@ ter@@ -@@ alco@@ holi@@ c brand .
is that something ?
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
i &apos;m tom .
well we can &apos;t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ ual fly .
and what i realized is i needed an exper@@ t .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ al@@ t@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
if they could do it for them , sur@@ ely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things ste@@ mm@@ ed and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ mm@@ ed and started with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ pa stage are you in now ?
why is it important to re@@ bo@@ ot ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other met@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ os@@ es that you &apos;ve had ?
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are you on ?
ee@@ ee@@ ee ! no , thank you .
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
those are ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ ed very nic@@ ely together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a para@@ do@@ x with those .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their str@@ eng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avo@@ id things that they &apos;re not sure of , avo@@ id fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
what other br@@ ands are like that ?
the first on here is the classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
now there &apos;s play@@ ful br@@ ands and min@@ d@@ ful br@@ ands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identi@@ ty , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , reser@@ ved , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful , being fres@@ h like the fres@@ h prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like er@@ ro@@ l fl@@ y@@ n@@ n , nim@@ ble or a@@ gi@@ le , pro@@ fan@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , ma@@ gi@@ cal or my@@ sti@@ cal like g@@ and@@ al@@ f .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
are you min@@ d@@ ful , sop@@ hi@@ sticated like 00@@ 7 ?
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
are you reli@@ able , st@@ able , familiar , safe , se@@ cure , s@@ ac@@ red , con@@ tem@@ pla@@ tive or wise like the dalai lama or yo@@ da ?
over the course of this film , we had 5@@ 00@@ -@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that norm@@ ally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ er would norm@@ ally never get behind .
they enab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the des@@ ire cent@@ ers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
we went to san pau@@ l@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , there &apos;s no po@@ sters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h@@ -@@ str@@ apped schools all across america .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
they cut out the midd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film premi@@ ered at the sun@@ dance film fe@@ sti@@ val , let &apos;s take a look .
according to bur@@ r@@ ell@@ es , the movie premi@@ ered in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media im@@ pres@@ sions for this film .
that &apos;s literally cover@@ ing just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to ga@@ in a lot of moment@@ um .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agen@@ cy we talked to ad@@ vis@@ ed their cli@@ ents not to take part .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take ris@@ ks , that in those ris@@ ks will come opportunity .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re p@@ ush@@ ing them more towards failure .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ verse , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be re@@ ward challen@@ ged .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encoura@@ ge people to take ris@@ ks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
we &apos;ve got to put that be@@ ar in a c@@ age .
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
and ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
em@@ c pres@@ ents : &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
so , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
i have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the par@@ ent organization to the ted organization , the s@@ ap@@ ling foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
my name is am@@ it .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mu@@ se@@ ums and art to my bos@@ s who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting mu@@ se@@ ums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not complaining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mu@@ se@@ ums and these art@@ works .
and so when i started traveling and going to these mu@@ se@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this des@@ ire to make it more accessi@@ ble with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
so , simple : you come to goo@@ g@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ c@@ t@@ .com .
you look around at all these mu@@ se@@ ums here .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jum@@ p .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the har@@ v@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
went in , and i started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
i did a little research , spo@@ ke to a couple of my con@@ tac@@ ts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which involves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jum@@ p into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
now the example i showed you was all about finding deta@@ ils .
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ aller@@ y .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
so i think , in con@@ clu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the mu@@ se@@ ums .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to rep@@ licate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titu@@ de of each he@@ mis@@ phere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intui@@ tive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titu@@ de in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experim@@ ent@@ al qu@@ ant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of logic to str@@ ing together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intui@@ tion to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intui@@ tion ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intui@@ tion from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intui@@ tion that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
but i be@@ t playing with this car stop taught him a really valu@@ able less@@ on , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great conc@@ ep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physicist .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intui@@ tion , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logi@@ cal side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so i made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clos@@ e-@@ up of the little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with a fres@@ h si@@ lic@@ on wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming po@@ ol@@ -@@ shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analo@@ gy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , fran@@ k@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
so qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ ani@@ mate objects feel the same way .
the fellow passen@@ gers for in@@ ani@@ mate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other passen@@ gers .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a v@@ acu@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we measu@@ red its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
now it &apos;s only at precise times when they al@@ ig@@ n .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places .
i think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just my logi@@ cal side talking .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness handle your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intui@@ tion , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just qu@@ ant@@ um objects just cr@@ am@@ med into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those conne@@ ctions , your conne@@ ctions to all the things around you , literally defin@@ e who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ conc@@ ep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it co@@ sts to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute apart@@ ment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apart@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the exi@@ sting apart@@ ments .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those apart@@ ments and the surro@@ unding areas have rules to avo@@ id dis@@ com@@ fort and the di@@ stra@@ ctions of construction .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new apart@@ ment building , as long as the rules there were ones that fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vi@@ er and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at one point , ja@@ vi@@ er said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ b@@ ass@@ y -- give some to the u.s. em@@ b@@ ass@@ y ; give some to the can@@ adi@@ an em@@ b@@ ass@@ y -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of can@@ ada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ b@@ ass@@ y gro@@ unds that they would otherwise have to go to can@@ ada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 200@@ 9 , hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching con@@ stit@@ u@@ tional crisis .
at the next reg@@ ularly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed election , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promis@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his ch@@ ie@@ f of staff .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user te@@ sting , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the b@@ are essenti@@ als .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the exi@@ sting apart@@ ment hol@@ ders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk .
he showed it to ja@@ vi@@ er .
they called me .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valu@@ able cities are , how much more valu@@ able they are than they cost .
and i used this slide showing how valu@@ able the ra@@ w land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fairly ab@@ stra@@ ct discussion , and at some point when there was a p@@ ause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on janu@@ ary fourth and fif@@ th .
so i pres@@ ented another fac@@ t-@@ filled lec@@ ture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ p@@ ort that was built in den@@ ver .
this air@@ p@@ ort alone cover@@ s more than 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to per@@ su@@ ade the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 hund@@ re@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
everybody ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ded poli@@ tely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
the leader of the con@@ gress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could offer new cho@@ ices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and it also involved new cho@@ ices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that ass@@ ur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they voted in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their con@@ stit@@ ution to have a con@@ stit@@ u@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gress in fa@@ vor of this con@@ stit@@ u@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
to be part of the con@@ stit@@ ution , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
on fe@@ bru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 11@@ 4 to one .
immediately after that vote , on fe@@ bru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 2@@ 4@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mit@@ s .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is sing@@ ap@@ ore .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
so if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for manag@@ ers to come in , and also an exter@@ nal legal system .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t be the cour@@ t of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some finan@@ cing .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to lo@@ c@@ ate in the americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
around the world , there &apos;s 7@@ 00 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents ?
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
and my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted . do you know how many cho@@ ices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many cho@@ ices you make in typical week ?
i recently did a survey with over 2@@ ,000 americ@@ ans , and the average number of cho@@ ices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they follo@@ wed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
and they found that the average ce@@ o enga@@ ged in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ cho@@ ices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own cho@@ ices .
do you know how many cho@@ ices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those cho@@ ices ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day cho@@ os@@ ing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to bur@@ n off some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
so when i was a gradu@@ ate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two dozen different kinds of bott@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drin@@ k ta@@ p water .
i used to love going to this store , but on one oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thousand@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manag@@ er , and i asked the manag@@ er , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
and he pointed to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with camer@@ as ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we pi@@ cked ja@@ m for our experiment .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of ja@@ m .
we set up a little ta@@ sting boot@@ h right near the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , s@@ ample some ja@@ m ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
now we see the op@@ posi@@ te effect .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
now cho@@ os@@ ing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ ential decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interest@@ s .
so now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sa@@ vings .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ rement sa@@ vings decisions of nearly a million americ@@ ans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.s .
and what we looked at was whether the number of f@@ und off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement sa@@ vings plan , the 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different f@@ und off@@ er@@ ings .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less parti@@ cip@@ ation rate .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , parti@@ cip@@ ation rates were around in the mid-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , parti@@ cip@@ ation rates have now dropped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ c@@ enti@@ le .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to partici@@ pate when there are more cho@@ ices present , even then , it has negative con@@ sequences .
so for those people who did choose to partici@@ pate , the more cho@@ ices available , the more likely people were to completely avo@@ id sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
the more cho@@ ices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recom@@ men@@ d for people when you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative con@@ sequences to off@@ ering people more and more cho@@ ices .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay cho@@ os@@ ing -- pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse cho@@ ices -- worse financial cho@@ ices , medical cho@@ ices .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less sa@@ tis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ cti@@ vely better .
the main reason for this is because , we might en@@ joy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ ises , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that st@@ unning display .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ ues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of co@@ sts , there is an impro@@ vement of the cho@@ os@@ ing experience .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when the gol@@ den cat corpor@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of co@@ sts .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today offers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today offers you 100,000 products .
but the n@@ in@@ th largest re@@ tail@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ tail@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it offers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce .
now in the financial sa@@ vings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ i@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at har@@ vard .
every single har@@ vard employe@@ e is now automa@@ tically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle f@@ und .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important cho@@ ices . &quot;
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these cho@@ ices are different from one another .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ noon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-@@ expen@@ s@@ es@@ -@@ paid free v@@ ac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his offer .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a tri@@ ck , didn &apos;t you .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ cti@@ vely more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the cho@@ ices , they have to be able to understand the con@@ sequences associ@@ ated with each choice , and that the con@@ sequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a cre@@ dit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan .
and during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you sa@@ ved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sa@@ vings accoun@@ t by four percent .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can handle more categories than we can handle cho@@ ices .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
it turns out that in we@@ g@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es all the way up to 6@@ 64 .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better cho@@ os@@ ing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays .
one is called &quot; ja@@ z@@ z &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
if you think the display on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right is ja@@ z@@ z , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ z@@ z and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ z@@ z and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me .
the categories need to say something to the cho@@ os@@ er , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ ma@@ ker .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : bu@@ ying a car .
here &apos;s a german car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of cho@@ ices that they offer per decision .
car colors , exter@@ ior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 cho@@ ices .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ ft -- four cho@@ ices .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
so half of the cu@@ stom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
the other half of the cu@@ stom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
what am i going to look at ?
how enga@@ ged you are .
if you keep hit@@ ting the de@@ fau@@ lt button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m los@@ ing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt button over and over and over again .
we &apos;re los@@ ing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of cho@@ ices .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
even though cho@@ os@@ ing ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ ft doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged .
so let me re@@ cap .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can handle more categories , less cho@@ ices ; condition for complexity .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your cho@@ ices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing .
and the more we &apos;re able to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing the better we will be able to practice the art of cho@@ os@@ ing .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m k@@ ev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the tr@@ ends manag@@ er at youtube , and i profession@@ ally watch youtube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vi@@ ral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when i was yo@@ unger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
but there are over 48 hours of video up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percent@@ age ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ kers , communities of parti@@ cip@@ ation and un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness .
all right , let &apos;s go .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
woo@@ o !
o@@ hhhh@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , be@@ ar v@@ as@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in y@@ os@@ e@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vi@@ ral video , be@@ ar .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is y@@ os@@ e@@ mi@@ te mountain be@@ ar .
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in janu@@ ary .
so what happened here ?
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
because ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ kers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
and if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
well t@@ os@@ h@@ .@@ 0 pi@@ cked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from my@@ ster@@ y science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twi@@ tter .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ kers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
unlike the one-@@ way enter@@ tainment of the 20@@ th century , this community parti@@ cip@@ ation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an cat &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed ani@@ ma@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
even cats were watching this video .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ ong@@ st this te@@ ch@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ k@@ y internet culture .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
and then it went international .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don &apos;t just en@@ joy now , we partici@@ pate .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bow &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an cat ? &quot;
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have con@@ ta@@ ined this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy prote@@ sting bi@@ cycle fin@@ es in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
so i got a ti@@ cket for not ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
o@@ hh@@ h@@ h .
what does it mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ kers , creative parti@@ cip@@ ating communities , complete un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness , these are charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , ju@@ stin b@@ ie@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
no one has to gre@@ en@@ -@@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own po@@ p culture .
and these are not charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will defin@@ e the enter@@ tainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the aston@@ ishing str@@ ength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small bo@@ at in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man bur@@ ning his life &apos;s work .
he is a poet , a play@@ wright , a man whose whole life had been balan@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s un@@ ity and freedom .
imagine him as the comm@@ uni@@ sts enter sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
he re@@ treated into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grand@@ father .
i never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my less@@ on was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a bo@@ at in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marri@@ age , already with two small girls .
for her , life had dist@@ ill@@ ed itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ g@@ a that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a bo@@ at sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fis@@ h@@ ing ves@@ sel .
all the adul@@ ts knew the ris@@ ks .
the greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , r@@ ape and death .
like most adul@@ ts on the bo@@ at , my mother car@@ ried a small bottle of po@@ is@@ on .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drin@@ k .
my first memor@@ ies are from the bo@@ at -- the ste@@ ad@@ y be@@ at of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wa@@ ve , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our bo@@ at , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mala@@ y@@ si@@ an co@@ ast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
after three months in a refuge@@ e cam@@ p , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shap@@ ing a new life together .
we se@@ tt@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demographic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
unlike the se@@ tt@@ led midd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , whose exist@@ ence i was obli@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
the sm@@ ells from sho@@ p do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assem@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
somehow she found time to study english and ga@@ in it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we were poor .
all the dollars were allo@@ cated and extra tu@@ i@@ tion in english and mathematics was bu@@ d@@ ge@@ ted for regar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
two pa@@ irs of sto@@ ck@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but se@@ aring chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the oc@@ c@@ asi@@ onal gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i : &quot; asi@@ an , go home . &quot;
go home to where ?
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
there was a gather@@ ing of resol@@ ve and a quie@@ t voice saying , &quot; i will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the bo@@ at .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
she open@@ ed a computer store then studied to be a be@@ au@@ ti@@ cian and open@@ ed another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and trou@@ bl@@ ed children caught between two worlds .
gr@@ ants and sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s were s@@ ought .
cent@@ ers were establi@@ shed .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the demand@@ s that i made on myself .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally scar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and is@@ ol@@ ation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was ch@@ osen as the young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
tan le , an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , refuge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invi@@ ted to speak in ven@@ ues she had never heard of and into homes whose exist@@ ence she could never have imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and com@@ fort of life in an uns@@ un@@ g sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two daugh@@ ters en@@ ding each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
she re@@ min@@ ded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the bo@@ at .
no had never been an option .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spo@@ ke out on you@@ th un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and education and the ne@@ gle@@ ct of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spo@@ ke , the more i was asked to speak .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a re@@ cent arri@@ val , new on the sc@@ ene -- and not just okay , but something to be than@@ k@@ ful for , perhaps a gi@@ ft from the bo@@ at .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the hori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ um@@ p@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
i have ste@@ pped outside my com@@ fort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possi@@ bilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able opti@@ mis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and dar@@ ing .
so i follo@@ wed my hun@@ ches .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for wh@@ om the lab@@ el &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
at the end of each day , i made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
after only one trip .
my hun@@ ches again .
three months later i had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the ad@@ venture has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mandar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
life ha@@ dn &apos;t changed for cent@@ uries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandar@@ in whose mother be@@ at her .
with no support from her hus@@ band , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to cour@@ t and pros@@ ec@@ u@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goo@@ d@@ by@@ e .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her cas@@ ke@@ t .
we told her stories and as@@ su@@ red her that we were still with her .
at mi@@ d@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ke@@ t .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it r@@ uns through the women .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
de@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the bo@@ at .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet i am afraid of privi@@ lege , of ease , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
can i give them a bow in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wa@@ ve , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y be@@ at of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it and still see them sa@@ f@@ ely through , i would .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
i &apos;m here to share my photo@@ graphy .
or is it photo@@ graphy ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photo@@ graphy started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
so to me it felt like photo@@ graphy was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
photos like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of real@@ ism .
or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of real@@ ism .
when i say real@@ ism , i mean photo@@ -@@ real@@ ism .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
but what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
is it something about the deta@@ ils or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illu@@ sion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illu@@ sion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
so i think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ na@@ te reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
so we tri@@ ck our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t acc@@ ept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process with combin@@ ing photograph@@ s .
it &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combin@@ ing photograph@@ s , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was comp@@ osed .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photo@@ graphic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
so here &apos;s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this image is actually entirely comp@@ osed of photograph@@ s from different lo@@ cations .
i person@@ ally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fis@@ h@@ ing trip .
the shor@@ es are from a different location .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photograph@@ s .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at rad@@ b@@ ou@@ d university is we ap@@ pointed a ch@@ ie@@ f listening off@@ ic@@ er .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my wi@@ fi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ olo@@ gi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 follo@@ wers on twi@@ tter .
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ fi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lun@@ ch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of g@@ aming activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for inst@@ ance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can colle@@ ct , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bl@@ ed dem@@ and and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we set up a website and asked the crow@@ d , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s clos@@ ed , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
and we built an i@@ pad appli@@ cation .
we made an appli@@ cation for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ ment@@ ed reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and whenever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , collea@@ gue universi@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these a@@ e@@ ds all around the world .
that whenever you &apos;re on holi@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own rela@@ tive or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for inst@@ ance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected discover@@ ies .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by pa@@ ying attention to ...
... pa@@ ying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just sk@@ i@@ p -- i &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to ha@@ te ; we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
we sel@@ ect a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sen@@ ding them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city h@@ all .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at figh@@ ting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named eri@@ k mi@@ cha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little app where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynam@@ ics on it .
this is a mo@@ dest little app .
it &apos;s probably the sm@@ all@@ est of the 2@@ 1 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t. department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t ts@@ un@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these ts@@ un@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies out of them .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and then se@@ at@@ tle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged storm dra@@ ins .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it norm@@ ally goes .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there is one project in the california cour@@ t system right now that so far cost tax@@ pay@@ ers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it sugge@@ sts how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means per@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and that &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tac@@ kl@@ ing the problem of government -- not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fied institution , but as a problem of colle@@ ctive action .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at colle@@ ctive action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
they are fru@@ str@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fi@@ x@@ ing it .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost si@@ ght of .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about poli@@ tics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of ti@@ m o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
poli@@ tics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately deri@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the con@@ clu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ os@@ sum stuck in your house .
so scot@@ t gets this call .
he types &quot; op@@ os@@ sum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really lou@@ d and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; op@@ os@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neigh@@ bor saw it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
op@@ os@@ sum ? check . living ? ye@@ p .
turned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . walked home .
goo@@ d@@ night swe@@ et op@@ os@@ sum . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neigh@@ bor is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
when one neigh@@ bor helps another , we str@@ eng@@ then our communities .
we call animal control , it just co@@ sts a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as poli@@ tics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and poli@@ tics is the si@@ x-@@ inch la@@ yer on top .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
people seem to think poli@@ tics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machin@@ ery of government .
so that &apos;s occu@@ p@@ y@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very de@@ tail@@ ed 3@@ 2@@ 5@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s request for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enorm@@ ous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s gro@@ wn up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 2@@ 8 , so i am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s gro@@ wn up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
they &apos;re not figh@@ ting that bat@@ tle that we &apos;re all figh@@ ting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can expres@@ s their opinion on any chan@@ ne@@ l at any time , and they do .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better .
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a g@@ arb@@ age can with an op@@ os@@ sum in it .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
but these app@@ s are like little digital re@@ min@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our tax@@ es and getting back services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crow@@ d of voices , or are we also going to be a crow@@ d of hands ?
thank you .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
this is just a random slide that i pi@@ cked out of my fi@@ le .
what i want to show you is not so much the deta@@ ils of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magni@@ tu@@ de in per@@ for@@ man@@ ce scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
now if i graph , for inst@@ ance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a fl@@ at line .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fee@@ ding growth where you go by orders of magni@@ tu@@ de every few years .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these expon@@ ential cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on for@@ ever .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole life@@ time .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , steri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of che@@ mic@@ als flo@@ ating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the che@@ mic@@ als got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drop@@ s of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different recip@@ es of che@@ mic@@ als in them .
and some of those drop@@ s of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of che@@ mic@@ als in them which caused them to in@@ corporate che@@ mic@@ als from the outside and grow the drop@@ s of oil .
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divide .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little drop@@ s of oil .
but now those drop@@ s of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recip@@ e of che@@ mic@@ als .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the che@@ mic@@ als within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the drop@@ s that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating che@@ mic@@ als around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more che@@ mic@@ als and divi@@ ded more .
so those tended to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drop@@ s learned a tri@@ ck about ab@@ stra@@ ction .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drop@@ s learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the recip@@ e of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolu@@ tionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the recip@@ e for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of le@@ tters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ grams of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard le@@ tters that we use for symboli@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amp@@ li@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ enty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had really been a e@@ go@@ ti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and rel@@ eas@@ ed it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually ex@@ change dna .
now that &apos;s why , for inst@@ ance , anti@@ bio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
some bacteria figu@@ red out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ st@@ ant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same bo@@ at together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recip@@ e for the community together on one str@@ ing of dna .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , mus@@ cle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to ab@@ stra@@ ct information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neur@@ al structures .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolu@@ tionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolu@@ tionary time sp@@ an .
so an organis@@ m could , for inst@@ ance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the life@@ time of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evolu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic@@ ating .
and for example , the most sop@@ hi@@ sticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully con@@ struc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ gy to it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and produ@@ cing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organis@@ m .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started ab@@ stra@@ cting out .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular organis@@ ms have gone through -- ab@@ stra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recording , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing information .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micros@@ e@@ con@@ ds .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolu@@ tionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
so the first ste@@ ps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next ste@@ ps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next ste@@ ps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next ste@@ ps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is fee@@ ding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re seeing this process fee@@ ding back on itself .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without re@@ cent advan@@ ces in computers .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ stor in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of ab@@ stra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one me@@ thod that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micros@@ e@@ con@@ d time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those program@@ s , and pick out the ones that came clos@@ est to doing what i wanted . &quot;
so in other words , i defin@@ e what i wanted .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
so find the program@@ s that come clos@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
take two program@@ s and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two program@@ s .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of program@@ s that are produced by combin@@ ations of the program@@ s that did a little bit better job .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
sc@@ ore them again .
introduce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , i end up with program@@ s that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
in fact , they are program@@ s that are much more efficient than program@@ s i could have ever written by hand .
now if i look at those program@@ s , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird program@@ s .
but they do the job .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very con@@ fi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of program@@ s that did the job .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 47 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel con@@ fi@@ dent ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
we &apos;re now using those program@@ s to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it &apos;s fee@@ ding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
because all of these technologies are fee@@ ding back on themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organis@@ ms were turning into multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organis@@ ms .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of produ@@ cing whatever that next thing is .
so lun@@ ch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selec@@ ted out .
my story beg@@ ins right here actually in ra@@ jas@@ than about two years ago .
i was in the des@@ ert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ fi sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the an@@ cient indian ep@@ ic &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jum@@ p into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ st@@ y , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
the con@@ clu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by machin@@ ery .
and this made me really sa@@ d .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a te@@ ch@@ no@@ pho@@ be .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to en@@ joy and app@@ reci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ et@@ ing it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and this piece of 50-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gi@@ cal thing to me .
it became a gil@@ ded gat@@ e@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our camer@@ as had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i jum@@ ped in , i jum@@ ped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a stor@@ y@@ telling device that could connect rea@@ ders all over the world .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and ani@@ ma@@ tion and sound and touch .
stor@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi@@ -@@ sensor@@ ial .
but what are we doing with it ?
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active app for the i@@ pad .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and actually i become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter drop@@ s down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually add@@ res@@ sed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possi@@ bilities .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ zar@@ ds and drag@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bor@@ ed as children .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fire@@ flies out .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be con@@ ta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gi@@ cal device within the device .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
all along , all fantas@@ y books have always had m@@ aps , but these m@@ aps have been sta@@ tic .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ ym@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tr@@ apped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s ch@@ am@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ st@@ y book .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and colle@@ ct pictures of different natural objects .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sticks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ells .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
so in bringing back this childhood ritu@@ al , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then tag it .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photograph@@ s that you can then put up online .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photograph@@ s that you &apos;ve actually taken .
in the possi@@ bilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possi@@ bilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ pad out with the video on and through aug@@ ment@@ ed reality , you see this la@@ yer of anim@@ ated pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a house@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blo@@ w them away and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pris@@ ons , on death row .
i spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
and being here at ted and seeing the stim@@ u@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identi@@ ty .
and you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and i men@@ tion that because i think identi@@ ty is really important .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassi@@ onate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
and so i want to talk about the power of identi@@ ty .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a mat@@ ri@@ arch , and that mat@@ ri@@ arch was my grandmother .
she was t@@ ough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually ens@@ la@@ ved .
her parents were born in s@@ la@@ very in virginia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of s@@ la@@ very very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was t@@ ough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ g@@ ging you ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d ass@@ au@@ lt me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget it .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
well i ad@@ ored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drin@@ k alco@@ hol . &quot;
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i grew up in the country in the r@@ ural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year yo@@ unger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ pack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation ma@@ ma had with you . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oh , ma@@ ma tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
i know this might be broad@@ c@@ ast broad@@ ly .
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alco@@ hol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identi@@ ty .
when we create the right kind of identi@@ ty , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hibi@@ tion .
my male un@@ cles died of alco@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to com@@ mit to .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 00@@ ,000 people in ja@@ ils and pris@@ ons .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states now has the high@@ est rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ ole .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my judg@@ ment , has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pa@@ ir , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being shaped by these out@@ comes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
in urban communities across this country -- los angel@@ es , phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shap@@ es out@@ comes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the poli@@ tics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ises you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 34 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
and there is this st@@ unning silence .
i represent children .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sent@@ ence 1@@ 3-@@ year-old children to die in prison .
we have life im@@ prison@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
and that &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identi@@ ty .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they com@@ mit , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defin@@ ed by er@@ ror .
for every nine people who have been ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rel@@ eas@@ ed from death row .
a kind of aston@@ ishing er@@ ror rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
in avi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can insu@@ late ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our strug@@ gle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about s@@ la@@ very .
i tell them about terror@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for african americ@@ ans in this country , that was an era defin@@ ed by terror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re de@@ aling with terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and that era of terror@@ ism , of course , was follo@@ wed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of ra@@ cial su@@ bor@@ din@@ ation and ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to com@@ mit ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in r@@ wand@@ a , even after the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
i was giving some lec@@ tures in ger@@ many about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the pres@@ entation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in ger@@ many .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in ger@@ many . &quot;
and the room got very quie@@ t , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systema@@ tic killing of human beings .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ting people . &quot;
and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of ger@@ many was ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately jewish ?
i couldn &apos;t be@@ ar it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we ex@@ ec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the victi@@ m is white than if the victi@@ m is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is black and the victi@@ m is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
well i believe that our identi@@ ty is at risk .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless imp@@ licated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love enter@@ tainment .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are shado@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ g@@ in@@ alization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to inte@@ gra@@ te the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ di@@ cated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is inte@@ gr@@ ated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intelle@@ ct as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ eled by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
and it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that i believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
v@@ ac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and de@@ aling with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be enga@@ ged in .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identi@@ ty is a much more challenging identi@@ ty than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great privi@@ lege , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ros@@ a parks .
and m@@ s. parks used to come back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r who was the organi@@ zer of the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia dur@@ r , a white woman , whose hus@@ band , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , repres@@ ented dr. king .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. parks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ ong@@ ly con@@ vi@@ cted .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the administra@@ tion of crimin@@ al justice .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole sent@@ ences for children .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on everyone &apos;s humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respe@@ cted by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the op@@ posi@@ te of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the op@@ posi@@ te of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so drama@@ tic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so stim@@ ulating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
i sometimes push too hard .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ enting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an ad@@ ult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an ad@@ ult , but i see this kid .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well g@@ os@@ h , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corporate ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive . &quot;
and i put in my motion that there was pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ori@@ al mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to cour@@ t .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh g@@ os@@ h , i &apos;ve got to go to the cour@@ t and do this crazy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
and as i was walking up the ste@@ ps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
and he whis@@ per@@ ed in my e@@ ar .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so pr@@ ou@@ d of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identi@@ ty , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
well i went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
i had written these crazy things .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and assi@@ st@@ ant pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty s@@ her@@ i@@ ff who was off@@ en@@ ded that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into cour@@ t .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jum@@ ped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
that our visi@@ ons of technology and design and enter@@ tainment and creativity have to be married with visi@@ ons of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious des@@ ire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ dire@@ ct some of the money we spend on the poli@@ tics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ i@@ ci@@ de cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all r@@ ape cases don &apos;t result .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement and safety .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
there &apos;s been this huge decl@@ ine in cri@@ me in america over the last three decades .
and part of the narra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ved that ?
well actually the violent cri@@ me rate has rema@@ ined rela@@ tively st@@ able .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent cri@@ me categories .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
that &apos;s where the drama@@ tic increas@@ es have come in our prison population .
and we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison for@@ ever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by cri@@ me , not do less .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation that we have to change .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
you &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
thre@@ ats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .

oh , my god .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally fee@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our sen@@ ses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an an@@ cient sli@@ ver of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be called the am@@ yg@@ dal@@ a .
now the am@@ yg@@ dal@@ a is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
so given a dozen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it lea@@ ds , &quot; is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species ex@@ tin@@ ction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we sur@@ ely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an has more than dou@@ bl@@ ed , average per cap@@ it@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted for in@@ f@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transpor@@ tation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,@@ 000-@@ fold .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ eful time ever in human history .
and charles ken@@ ny that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expec@@ tations higher and higher .
in fact , we re@@ defin@@ e what poverty means .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toile@@ ts , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ uries .
under@@ p@@ inn@@ ing much of this is technology , and of late , exponenti@@ ally growing technologies .
my good friend ray kur@@ z@@ wei@@ l showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price per@@ for@@ man@@ ce dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times che@@ aper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rec@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this cur@@ ve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
clou@@ d computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infin@@ ite computing ; sensors and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d prin@@ ting , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; syn@@ thetic biology ; fu@@ els , vacc@@ ines and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ om@@ ateri@@ als ; and a.@@ i .
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by i@@ b@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
i mean , that was ep@@ ic .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper i could .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qu@@ ish@@ es human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
and imagine if you would a.@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the clou@@ d available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
four years ago here at ted , ray kur@@ z@@ wei@@ l and i started a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have so@@ unded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
today we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that .
when i think about creating ab@@ un@@ dance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lux@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant .
you see , scar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resour@@ c@@ e-@@ liber@@ ating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of nap@@ o@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the mid-@@ 18@@ 00@@ s .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
he invi@@ ted over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
all of nap@@ o@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were fed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , nap@@ o@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
but the king of si@@ am , he was fed with al@@ umin@@ um u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
you see , al@@ umin@@ um was the most valu@@ able metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent is made of al@@ umin@@ um .
you see , even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
it &apos;s all bo@@ und by oxygen and si@@ lic@@ ates .
but then the technology of elec@@ tro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w@@ -@@ away ment@@ ality .
so let &apos;s project this analo@@ gy going forward .
we think about energy scar@@ city .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , we are on a planet that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ watts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
it &apos;s not about being scar@@ ce , it &apos;s about accessi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar-@@ gener@@ ated electricity is 50 percent that of dies@@ el@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity in india -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilo@@ wat@@ t hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ag@@ er spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft back towards the earth , in 19@@ 90 after it just passed saturn ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there &apos;s nanot@@ echn@@ ology coming on , nan@@ om@@ ateri@@ als .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drin@@ king water a day out of any source -- sal@@ t@@ water , poll@@ u@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two cents a li@@ ter .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every con@@ fi@@ dence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will dep@@ lo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ et@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
think about it , that a mas@@ ai war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re on a smart@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ un@@ dance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ ari@@ es of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
last month , i had the pleas@@ ure of anno@@ un@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically com@@ bine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a.@@ i@@ . , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and to win , it needs to be able to diag@@ nose you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it call@@ s the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
i call it the ris@@ ing billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world edu@@ cated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are conne@@ cting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they des@@ ire ?
and rather than having economic sh@@ ut@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic in@@ je@@ ction ever .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars in@@ je@@ cted into the global economy .
and they will get health@@ ier by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better edu@@ cated by using the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d prin@@ ting and infin@@ ite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
so what could three billion ris@@ ing , healthy , edu@@ cated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpor@@ ations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ at@@ tle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o acids and figure out how the prot@@ ein is going to fold .
and how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best prot@@ ein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ chester , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive assi@@ st@@ ant at a re@@ ha@@ b clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best prot@@ ein fol@@ der .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , what gives me tremendous con@@ fi@@ dence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this expon@@ ential technology .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of the te@@ ch@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ ist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and i think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ stige to be able to do that .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of bas@@ e@@ ball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
we all love bas@@ e@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?
bas@@ e@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great bas@@ e@@ ball team .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 300 .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted sa@@ f@@ ely , hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and wh@@ o@@ ever tried to th@@ row it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the r@@ un@@ ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in major lea@@ gue bas@@ e@@ ball ?
good , really good , maybe an all-@@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 bas@@ e@@ ball hit@@ ter ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times sa@@ f@@ ely out of every 10 .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as in ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue bas@@ e@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regu@@ lar seas@@ on .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surgeon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
and she &apos;s hit@@ ting a 2@@ 5@@ 7 .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ dia@@ c surgeon or a nurse practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surgeon , an ob@@ gy@@ n , a par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physi@@ cian or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mista@@ ke , but you worry about the deta@@ ils , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was in med school .
i was an ob@@ s@@ essi@@ ve comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
and so i did .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; res@@ iden@@ ce at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
and i memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the origins and exer@@ tions of every mus@@ cle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagn@@ os@@ es ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
i even knew the differ@@ ential diagn@@ osis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar ac@@ i@@ d@@ osis .
and all the while , i was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i came out of medical school with the im@@ pres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mista@@ kes .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working .
at the time i was assig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology consu@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and when i listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , and instead of being able to pu@@ m@@ p all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the lung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagn@@ osis to make .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to rel@@ ie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mista@@ ke ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mista@@ kes .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ nis@@ h addi@@ tional information about her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to cont@@ act him .
the second mista@@ ke that i made was worse .
in sen@@ ding her home , i dis@@ regar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in con@@ fi@@ dence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so i signed the dis@@ char@@ ge pap@@ ers , and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce came , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came to take her home .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that after@@ noon , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ ked up to leave the hospital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know dre@@ ad .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergen@@ cy medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nurse asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
and she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staff pulled out all the stops .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
and i was shocked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care un@@ it , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had ir@@ re@@ versi@@ ble brain damage .
and the family gather@@ ed .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ ig@@ ned themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ ck@@ er , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with that .
over the next few weeks , i be@@ at myself up and i experi@@ enced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , is@@ ol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible disc@@ us@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mista@@ ke again .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mista@@ ke again .
that &apos;s the kind of sh@@ ame that is a teacher .
the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what i was feeling .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mista@@ ke ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but sur@@ ely , it li@@ f@@ ted .
i began to feel a bit better .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wonder@@ ed , maybe i could feel better again .
and i made myself a bar@@ ga@@ in that if only i re@@ double my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mista@@ ke again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emergen@@ cy department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
it was bus@@ y , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit pin@@ k .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shi@@ ft , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak to me quie@@ tly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
he had a potenti@@ ally life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condition called ep@@ i@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and fortun@@ ately he didn &apos;t die .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
and i went through the same period of sh@@ ame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emergen@@ cy shi@@ ft , i mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
one i thought had a ki@@ d@@ ney stone .
i or@@ dered a ki@@ d@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my collea@@ gue who was doing a re@@ ass@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ r@@ ant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
the other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my collea@@ gue to re@@ ass@@ ess him .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ r@@ ant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mista@@ kes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
some of my do@@ o@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
alone , as@@ ham@@ ed and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mista@@ kes , if i can &apos;t find the st@@ ill@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a co@@ ck@@ tail par@@ ty and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mista@@ kes .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye cont@@ act with that person .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mista@@ kes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mista@@ kes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mista@@ kes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journal@@ ism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical err@@ ors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i &apos;ve learned is that err@@ ors are absolutely ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we work in a system where err@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong d@@ os@@ age , where hos@@ pit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
in this country , as many as 2@@ 4,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical err@@ ors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ g@@ ged it at 100,000 .
in both cases , these are gros@@ s under@@ estim@@ ates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
and here &apos;s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive bi@@ as@@ es , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of alco@@ hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symp@@ tom@@ s in the same way each time .
given all of that , mista@@ kes are ine@@ vi@@ table .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the err@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mista@@ ke , &quot; i would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs to the ch@@ ie@@ f of car@@ dia@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mista@@ ke , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and their pu@@ pil@@ s would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mista@@ ke i did . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a re@@ defin@@ ed medical culture .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
the re@@ defin@@ ed physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t pr@@ ou@@ d of making mista@@ kes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shar@@ es her experience with others .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mista@@ kes .
and she points out other people &apos;s mista@@ kes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mista@@ kes from time to time .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ ups that make it easier to detect those mista@@ kes that humans ine@@ vit@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mista@@ kes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mista@@ kes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
my name is brian gol@@ d@@ man .
i am a re@@ defin@@ ed physi@@ cian .
i &apos;m human . i make mista@@ kes .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ el@@ ine .
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
the bro@@ chur@@ es still say it is un@@ touched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illu@@ strate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
and i got a big sun@@ bur@@ n , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
this was my first sun@@ bur@@ n .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
and it had ti@@ lap@@ ia about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ lap@@ ia called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ lap@@ ia .
and the fis@@ her@@ ies for this ti@@ lap@@ ia susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in ghana .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of their size .
they were mat@@ uring at five centi@@ meters .
they had been p@@ ush@@ ed gene@@ tically .
there were still fis@@ hes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ her@@ s and this bo@@ at , quite ug@@ ly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and i went sa@@ iling on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the sou@@ th@@ ern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our cat@@ ch were sp@@ on@@ ges , other animals that are fi@@ x@@ ed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rap@@ id .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fis@@ h@@ ing beg@@ ins .
the bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or so@@ ft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy mess .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collected by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fis@@ h@@ ed .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
we trans@@ form the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ad@@ just our bas@@ el@@ ine to the new level , and we don &apos;t re@@ call what was there .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their consci@@ ous lives as a standard and will ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate forward .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant , before it gets ex@@ tin@@ ct , it becomes rare .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
over time , we concent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ el@@ ine .
and the question is , why do people acc@@ ept this ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so@@ -@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sour@@ ces of the past .
and h@@ ence , the enorm@@ ous role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
because with marine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot conc@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ el@@ ine has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a marine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which enab@@ les them to res@@ et their bas@@ el@@ ine .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mi@@ d@@ west for example ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simu@@ lation .
this is a simu@@ lation of ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ a@@ ke bay .
there were gray wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar . &quot;
and if you think about &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so touched by the ima@@ gery ?
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my recom@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for camer@@ on to do &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist eastern ger@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
you had to regi@@ ster a s@@ ample she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and buy a color laser prin@@ ter from any major laser prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sour@@ ces of online problems today .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attac@@ ks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
we have three main groups .
we have online crimin@@ als .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of k@@ ie@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ air@@ es online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attac@@ ks .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form tar@@ t@@ u in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is al@@ fre@@ d g@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
this is stephen wat@@ t .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
this is mat@@ the@@ w anderson , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ dit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the s@@ wis@@ s bank accoun@@ t of mr. sa@@ m ja@@ in right here , and that bank accoun@@ t had 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on the lo@@ ose ; nobody knows where he is .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victi@@ m of a cri@@ me online than here in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of cri@@ me will be happening online .
the second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opinion , motiv@@ ated by the lau@@ gh@@ s .
groups like an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attac@@ ks .
so those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ack@@ tivi@@ sts like an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were hac@@ ked into .
somebody broke in and they hac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people died because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
well dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ ma@@ il .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ ma@@ il or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l conne@@ ctions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their disc@@ us@@ sions .
except they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
what about ar@@ ab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police in ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pap@@ ers .
among those pap@@ ers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in ger@@ many which had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ c@@ ep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 eu@@ ro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in ger@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by german government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
if you are a suspe@@ ct in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which enab@@ les them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online disc@@ us@@ sions , to colle@@ ct your pass@@ words .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .
why should i worry ?
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
priv@@ acy is imp@@ lied .
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fi@@ x@@ ed measu@@ rement that fit together .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction un@@ it in the world .
they enab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 19@@ 47 , le@@ go came up with this .
it was called the automa@@ tic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every house@@ hold .
it &apos;s estim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engine@@ er to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
le@@ go made it accessi@@ ble .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at b@@ ell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be anno@@ un@@ ced , the next building block .
the transi@@ stor was a small plastic un@@ it that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ stor was only for exper@@ ts .
i person@@ ally don &apos;t acc@@ ept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for exper@@ ts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its are electron@@ ic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensors .
and the best part about it is they s@@ na@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , pin@@ k is input and or@@ ange is wire .
so all you need to do is s@@ na@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
add this bu@@ z@@ zer for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a re@@ ad@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
lights , sounds , solar panels , mot@@ ors -- everything should be accessi@@ ble .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an i@@ po@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its to design schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bott@@ les , we have geor@@ die making ...
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion-@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
to these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessi@@ ble to everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ le@@ b@@ its is open-@@ source .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
we want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of inv@@ ent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
thank you .
