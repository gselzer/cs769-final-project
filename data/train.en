this is a work called &quot; room for the great australi@@ an desert . &quot;
and design was in everything my dad did .
now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence in the ocean because evolution has sele@@ cted for the color that tra@@ vels far@@ th@@ est through se@@ a@@ water in order to optimi@@ ze communication .
the other half have one par@@ ent because the other par@@ ent has died through aids .
and back to the ye@@ w here .
i would never have been that advent@@ ur@@ ous before i started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
she &apos;s only two years old , and she &apos;s having a b@@ last .
now let me tell you that story .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
and this is precisely what fa@@ ils in the political visions we have now , in the political governments .
we actually take don@@ or organs , organs that are dis@@ car@@ ded , and we then can use very mil@@ d deter@@ g@@ ents to take all the cell elements out of these organs .
the united nations recogni@@ zed earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and other synthetic drugs .
in north su@@ la@@ wes@@ i it is the cooper@@ ative -- they have a democratic culture there , so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .
and i &apos;m so passionate about it .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
well , one fact that we can take advan@@ tage of , i think a fact you &apos;ll all agree is true , is that time goes forward , not back@@ ward . right ? the cause has to come before the effect .
much of the time we &apos;re trans@@ fixed by all of the ways we can refle@@ ct ourselves into the world .
si@@ x@@ teen percent , by weight , of the inter@@ ior con@@ tains fro@@ zen water , or ice .
but instead , surpris@@ ingly , he said , &quot; oh , bring her down here for a year , and if i can &apos;t win her over , no one can . &quot;
and though young people from the ar@@ ab world were pretty successful in bringing down three di@@ c@@ tat@@ ors , sha@@ king the region , kind of per@@ su@@ ading cle@@ ver k@@ ings from j@@ ord@@ an and mor@@ oc@@ co doing substan@@ ti@@ al re@@ forms , it is yet to be seen what will be the out@@ come , whether the egyp@@ ti@@ ans and tun@@ isi@@ ans will make it through the transition or this will end in bloo@@ dy eth@@ ni@@ c and religi@@ ous conflict , whether the sy@@ ri@@ ans will main@@ tain non@@ violent discipline , fac@@ ed with the bru@@ tal da@@ ily violence which kills thousands already , or they will sli@@ p into violent strug@@ gle and make ug@@ ly civil war .
so this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet . it &apos;s turned by 90 degrees .
so then , i jum@@ ped on the top like that , with my team , and it works .
the con@@ tra@@ ctors , they don &apos;t like that .
therefore i believe it should not be cool .
so as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing aspects of prison life is in@@ genu@@ ity .
so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called &quot; the bot@@ any of desire . &quot;
good things happen , and it &apos;s good for much of the world .
and it means , right , you are in the recovery .
pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an zones and dedi@@ cated traffic lan@@ es are going to be created , and all of this will cut down the average rush hour com@@ mu@@ te to get across town in new york from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes .
and this en@@ ables them to ori@@ ent in complete dar@@ k@@ ness .
i talked a lot in the past about statistics , and the pro@@ vision of safe drin@@ king water for all .
the small@@ est virus , on the other hand , is about 25 nan@@ om@@ e@@ ters .
and i &apos;ve assem@@ bled a sam@@ pl@@ ing of work that all share a kind of produ@@ ctive ni@@ hi@@ li@@ sm that &apos;s used in the service of creating a particular special effect .
as it turned out , next morning i wrote a le@@ tter to both of them , and s@@ hab@@ ana az@@ m@@ i repli@@ ed , and came and launched my very first show 12 years ago .
hi there .
ok , the second big en@@ ab@@ ler , and this is where i told a big lie .
&quot; go away you mani@@ ac@@ -@@ psychop@@ ath .
we need rich@@ -@@ world governments to be very gener@@ ous in provi@@ ding aid for these things .
we have to shift from this ma@@ infra@@ me ment@@ ality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
point is : there &apos;s obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bo@@ unds .
so essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information .
for generations , we &apos;ve been rais@@ ing our children , not unlike millions of other species living bes@@ ide us .
and this is accomp@@ li@@ shed using this kind of device , and this is called deep brain stimulation .
he allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time , and he even turned his face toward the light , as if he wanted me to see him better .
the problem in li@@ b@@ ya is that we are always pushing for the black or white .
now , this is a real hospital , in a real emer@@ gency room .
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
and here was him , den@@ ying .
i &apos;ve had a patent , and that was cool , and we started a company , and it grew , and it became the biggest , and then it went down , and then it became the biggest again , which is harder than the first time , and then we sold it , and then we sold it again .
this language is communic@@ ating that it is surprised to see you , and it &apos;s interested in looking at you .
&quot; the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean .
and just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there .
it &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
and when he then wal@@ ks back to the media lab , he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he &apos;s taken , sort through them and organize them , and re-@@ size them , etc . , again using all natural gest@@ ures .
i was re@@ fer@@ red to a psychiat@@ r@@ ist , who li@@ ke@@ wise took a gri@@ m view of the voice &apos;s presence , sub@@ sequ@@ ently interpre@@ ting everything i said through a l@@ ens of lat@@ ent in@@ san@@ ity .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
and the other kind tells you how to cope with what we poli@@ tely call &quot; low self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em , &quot; or im@@ poli@@ tely call &quot; feeling very bad about yourself . &quot;
ali car@@ r-@@ ch@@ ell@@ man : gam@@ ing to re-@@ enga@@ ge boys in learning
and so we sent one onto the mir space station .
this is a fl@@ or@@ al the@@ me cal@@ end@@ ar in 1997 , and this is a fire@@ work cal@@ end@@ ar . so , you la@@ unch the number into space , because the japanese believe that when you see fire@@ works , you &apos;re cool@@ er for some reason .
so that &apos;s the fla@@ p , and all the rest of the paper &apos;s left over .
no , no , i wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
then i was sho@@ cked . what is the connection between using a san@@ it@@ ary pad and a milk budget ?
and this is what we discovered .
kri@@ sta tipp@@ et@@ t : re@@ conne@@ cting with compassion
now i &apos;m going to tell you one funny thing about this .
now most environ@@ ment@@ ali@@ sts don &apos;t say growth is good , because , in our le@@ xic@@ on , as@@ p@@ halt is two words : as@@ sig@@ ning bl@@ ame .
but if you push the butt@@ on , of course , the whole wall goes dark .
and there is , of course , this glam@@ our .
come on into the secret lab .
language changes over time , and it &apos;s a powerful force .
hand@@ writing is a disappe@@ aring art .
there is a pro@@ cession of sy@@ ll@@ ables -- whe@@ at , one ; pra@@ i@@ ries , two ; lost swe@@ de to@@ wns , three -- one , two , three .
now in fact , some of our transforma@@ tive leaders in history have been introver@@ ts .
&quot; no , i want to make maps of planets . &quot;
but there &apos;s a lot of technology going .
they &apos;re building a system that e@@ je@@ cts these at quar@@ ter-@@ second inter@@ v@@ als .
some people say that democracy consi@@ sts basically in elections .
the most fri@@ ction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock .
he &apos;s trying to find and solve water issues , the crisis around the world .
people who spent money on other people got happ@@ ier .
one last example from this data : sometimes it &apos;s actually a piece of content that is special .
in the world of go@@ d@@ z@@ illa spider mit@@ es , we can make millions of mi@@ rr@@ ors , each one-@@ fifth the diam@@ eter of a human hair , moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen dis@@ plays , so that we can watch movies like &quot; go@@ d@@ z@@ illa &quot; in high-@@ de@@ f .
they also got faster .
books have sa@@ ved the introver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that i was -- that i once was .
i &apos;ve been to some of those contin@@ ents , but africa was , in the words of steven pin@@ ker , was a b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late , largely .
why ? because it would make it necessary to cri@@ min@@ alize the corruption of de@@ pu@@ ties .
and any infrastructure you look at -- whether it &apos;s the leng@@ th of ro@@ ads , leng@@ th of electri@@ cal lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale sc@@ aling in the same way .
but the second shot i did was my shoes i was wearing on the day .
so , we all know about the nar@@ ma@@ da river , the trage@@ dies of dam@@ s , the trage@@ dies of huge projects which dis@@ place people and wre@@ ck river systems without provi@@ ding li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods .
i wanted to know about their seas@@ on@@ ality , what time of year , this is when they first arri@@ ve , but how long are they around for ? does that give any clu@@ es ?
we had this on our website for a while , but we found that after we put it on our website , we didn &apos;t get any job app@@ lications anymore .
it involves light con@@ es and qu@@ ant@@ um ent@@ ang@@ lement , and i don &apos;t really understand any of that .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic vo@@ y@@ age , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
what all of these things have in common is that they cost money .
well , the laws of physics are written up there , which describe what -- how the power consumption for he@@ ating is driven by the things you can control .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
and they even talked about feeling happ@@ ier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tac@@ kl@@ ing the tou@@ gh@@ est challenge of their lives .
and so what we have here is a descri@@ ption of single cells repli@@ c@@ ating , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing , burning through chemi@@ stri@@ es .
and finally , number one : biggest dan@@ ger to life as we know it , i think , a really big astero@@ id heads for earth .
it &apos;s from the sen@@ ate .
knowing somebody &apos;s your k@@ in typ@@ ically kills the li@@ bi@@ do .
it &apos;s about acting in the face of over@@ whel@@ m .
in other words , she wanted us to think that she had not e@@ aten it , so she would get two .
and it &apos;s a great hon@@ or to be an ir@@ ani@@ an woman and an ir@@ ani@@ an artist , even if i have to oper@@ ate in the west only for now .
per@@ es thought that was a great idea .
the team is proud of our four attemp@@ ts .
now how did we get here ?
ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diam@@ ond before ?
it &apos;s called op@@ to-@@ is@@ ol@@ ator .
if i throw a very concent@@ ric circle , or concent@@ ric elli@@ p@@ se , it just du@@ ti@@ fully makes these ev@@ en@@ ly spac@@ ed lines , which get closer and closer together , which descri@@ bes how gravi@@ ty works .
the t@@ ar s@@ ands tox@@ ins are in the food cha@@ in , and this is caus@@ ing cancer rates up to 10 times what they are in the rest of canada .
i want to talk to the people in asia , la@@ tin america , africa , europe se@@ am@@ less@@ ly , accur@@ ately and in a co@@ st-@@ effective fashion using technology .
my name is tom , and i &apos;ve come here today to come clean about what i do for money .
so , social networks are these in@@ tri@@ cate things of beauty , and they &apos;re so el@@ abor@@ ate and so complex and so ubi@@ quit@@ ous , in fact , that one has to ask what purpose they serve .
co@@ -@@ cre@@ ator of the philanthrop@@ ic feed ba@@ gs , ellen gu@@ staf@@ son says hunger and o@@ bes@@ ity are two sides of the same co@@ in . in her talk , she laun@@ ches the 30 project -- a way to change how we farm and eat in the next 30 years , and solve the global food in@@ equ@@ alities behind both epide@@ mi@@ cs . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i was talking to war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t &apos;s ban@@ ker , and he was chi@@ ding me for not le@@ tting my children make mistakes with their allo@@ wan@@ ce .
and then again , there is the fact that we are stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed .
over the last few years , i haven &apos;t had that much time to really think .
ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then .
the next year they mar@@ ch forward and they introdu@@ ce qu@@ be , the first inter@@ active c@@ able tv system , and the new york times her@@ al@@ ds this as tele@@ communications moving to the home , conver@@ gence , great things are happening .
and there &apos;s some complicated cryp@@ to@@ graphy going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is vot@@ ing with one of these forms .
you know , is it worth trying to get there ?
and even though you &apos;re only going to be in the n@@ ba for a few years , you &apos;re going to be an n@@ ba player for the rest of your life .
now that is true . that is what hom@@ e@@ op@@ ath@@ y is all about .
and of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
and so we can feel un@@ finished .
mar@@ cus : you &apos;re a r@@ app@@ er , am i right ?
i went from des@@ k-@@ d@@ w@@ elling computer ner@@ d to the kind of guy who bikes to work -- for fun .
right now , you have a few enth@@ usi@@ a@@ sts talking about it , some in a positive side , some in a negative side -- but that &apos;s a dangerous state to be in because there &apos;s very little dep@@ th of knowledge on this topic .
you &apos;re looking at the entire nor@@ th@@ western gulf of mexico ; you &apos;re looking at one toxic din@@ o@@ fla@@ g@@ ell@@ ate blo@@ om that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right .
well , we believe , again , that this should be the beginning , the very first step , to do real conservation , and allo@@ wing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation , the technique , materials , and also if , when , and why we should re@@ store , or , rather , to inter@@ v@@ ene on the environment surrounding the pain@@ ting .
we do not need everything that is there . &quot;
it &apos;s made of light and sha@@ dow .
and the result is sort of gra@@ ti@@ f@@ y@@ ingly per@@ pet@@ ual .
before , i was an architect , and my grand@@ mother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
and skelet@@ al muscle const@@ it@@ utes 50 percent of our body , or over 50 percent of our body . and so at first i kind of thought , &quot; well , maybe there &apos;s some obvious explanation why skelet@@ al muscle doesn &apos;t get cancer -- at least not that i know of . &quot;
in fr@@ ance , a bus company is su@@ ing people for for@@ ming a car@@ po@@ ol , right , because the fact that they have co@@ ordin@@ ated themselves to create cooper@@ ative value is de@@ pri@@ ving them of re@@ venue .
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be inter@@ rup@@ ted .
we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures , they stop car@@ ing about the drawing and care only about the reward .
i got a call from a friend in pho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
well , it was wonderful . bo@@ g@@ gles my mind .
so when i went through the data , i had very surprising results , because i found that four out of the five mar@@ in@@ ating ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents actually in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited the car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen formation .
but with the rise of inter@@ state tru@@ cking , it was used less and less .
it &apos;s about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
if you are feeling very cold , you come near a fire , it &apos;s so wonderful .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincoln could never have imag@@ ined how far his reputation would reach .
and to connect our country after world war ii , we didn &apos;t build more two-@@ lan@@ e highways , we built the inter@@ state highway system .
and you &apos;re looking at it from the off@@ ices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
what i do with my kids now -- i &apos;ve got two , nine and seven -- is i teach them to walk around the house and the y@@ ard , looking for stuff that needs to get done .
but what you &apos;ve just done is , in many respe@@ cts , mathema@@ tically impossible .
but one more ad@@ ded feature .
now we can eat local food .
it went into time magazine in 200@@ 1 as the new language of the 21st century .
and it was a war@@ ning -- don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business , or you &apos;re going to get stuck .
they &apos;ve created our wealth .
you may just know more about everything than anyone .
that &apos;s me at my des@@ k .
with all the side effects ?
but , of course , aff@@ or@@ ds greater through@@ put , fewer acci@@ d@@ ents , and an interesting model of social movement .
they were actually ab@@ using them , despite the fact of how pe@@ ac@@ eful these guys were -- they were not even prote@@ sting .
is technology diam@@ et@@ ri@@ cally opposed to nature ?
stick with the people you know .
they are impossible to ju@@ g@@ gle . &quot;
now think about it . this is an amazing thing : that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , dist@@ ant , far away , just all ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating .
so people believe now that ti@@ tan is most likely what we call a pre@@ -@@ bio@@ tic planet , because it &apos;s so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material , and therefore life could have evolved on it .
the earth always did have limits .
and this is a sk@@ ull that is two meters long .
the first level , the weak@@ est level of civil response against violence , is den@@ ial and ap@@ ath@@ y .
it &apos;s -- oh , no , it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a really hard one .
so they gave the course of 10 , and the first -- the usual course , inci@@ dent@@ ally , was six to eight and still is six to eight .
or perhaps i need to make myself a speaking tool , like an ic@@ y me@@ g@@ ap@@ h@@ one that i can use to amp@@ li@@ fy my voice when i direct it at the ice .
and i found i could do it with a nas@@ al inhal@@ er .
safety -- safety first ?
well , there &apos;s a long white ro@@ be in heaven , i know .
so i would never win the race because i &apos;m always stop@@ ping .
these things , among maybe other vari@@ ables , but these things seem to predict it .
i spend as much of my time as possible investig@@ ating the mar@@ ine life .
ob@@ serve from a distance , but do not join the fra@@ y .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or e@@ bay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
and then i was ama@@ zed at what role technology played in your recovery .
the impact of this has been that these hospitals , in the second year after our consu@@ l@@ tation , are double their out@@ put and then achieve financial recovery as well .
but when he actually had a university of pit@@ ts@@ burgh swe@@ at@@ shirt , che@@ ating went down .
and it was also the beginning of our dis@@ content , because if you wanted to di@@ still all of our experience since the pal@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic , it would come down to two words : how and why .
other times , it &apos;s not even my stories .
the care doesn &apos;t stop when the baby &apos;s born -- we deal with the on@@ going health of the mother and baby , en@@ sur@@ ing that they live healthy , successful lives .
today we are making metals that are ligh@@ ter than sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , so light they can sit at@@ op a dan@@ deli@@ on pu@@ ff and be blo@@ wn away with a wis@@ p of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can li@@ ft , but so strong that it has the crash@@ -@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of an su@@ v .
would you each enter that on your calcul@@ ator ?
so we have this incredible presence today of agriculture domin@@ ating our planet , whether it &apos;s 40 percent of our land surface , 70 percent of the water we use , 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions .
in it@@ al@@ y , in mil@@ an especially , contemporary art really doesn &apos;t have that much of a place .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
and once you have electric motors , you can do anything : you can change the structure of the car in any way you want .
this is a photo of cap@@ tain scott and his team .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journal , the quar@@ ter@@ ly review of biology .
i believe that the only way that it is possible for us to constru@@ ct genu@@ in@@ ely sustainable hom@@ es and cities is by conne@@ cting them to nature , not insu@@ l@@ ating them from it .
so the whole thing can g@@ ently move when the wind blo@@ ws .
now , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passi@@ ons , especially my passion for judge ju@@ dy , and you &apos;d fight anybody who attemp@@ ted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that repres@@ ent the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ral re@@ per@@ toi@@ re , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
the freedom to ch@@ ose where to live , what to do , what to buy , what to sell , from whom , to whom , when and how .
it &apos;s a weird thing for us humans to w@@ rap our minds around , since we only ever get to experience one possibility .
if education can be li@@ ken@@ ed to wat@@ ering a garden , which is a fair metaph@@ or , sa@@ dly , much of the water is ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ating before it reach@@ es the flo@@ wers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment .
and now we are hit@@ ting those limits on multiple fron@@ ts .
we do like to consu@@ me , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
&quot; ah@@ a ! &quot; said dr. ro@@ bi@@ c@@ se@@ k . &quot; i went to the movie all by myself . &quot;
and here is this , then , young man called wil@@ ly bo@@ hm who worked for the us@@ aid .
so what does the ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ year-old do ?
ali@@ ci@@ a , in her own right , very famous .
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called lon@@ d@@ olo@@ z@@ i game reser@@ ve .
does anybody know what he was looking for ?
so , i hopefully am writing , you know , books that are good for children and for adults .
oh no , we &apos;re just sta@@ ging , ro@@ d : we &apos;re just sta@@ ging it .
my next pur@@ suit was i wanted to see how long i could go without brea@@ thing , like how long i could survive with nothing , not even air .
and certainly , n@@ either cri@@ ck or i were chemi@@ sts , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , fran@@ c@@ is knew wil@@ kins .
but it &apos;s actually not , because there &apos;s an example by statistics professor , h@@ ans ros@@ ling .
well , the human body is literally pac@@ ked with them : 6@@ 0,000 miles worth in a typical adult .
this is my favorite picture . this was just taken a few weeks ago .
we have like 40 kids , ex@@ -@@ child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
i really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; i &apos;m great , &quot; because that kind of sounds nar@@ cis@@ si@@ stic , and then i won &apos;t have any friends .
weather patterns have changed .
in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s , ro@@ ger pay@@ ne and an ocean ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cian published a theor@@ e@@ tical paper poin@@ ting out that it was possible that sound could trans@@ mit over these large areas , but very few bi@@ ologists believed it .
and indeed , it &apos;s this part of the brain , the core of the nu@@ cle@@ us ac@@ cum@@ ben@@ s , actually , that is becoming active as you &apos;re measuring your gains and los@@ ses .
&quot; doing that , acting by design , is what we all should be doing .
well , my brother heard that we had made g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der .
the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers become for@@ a@@ gers .
so a tumor expres@@ ses chemo@@ k@@ ine re@@ cep@@ tors , and another organ -- a dist@@ ant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the cor@@ respon@@ ding chemo@@ kin@@ es , and the tumor will see these chemo@@ kin@@ es and mi@@ gra@@ te towards it .
our connection to reality is never just perception .
but why is it so hard to slow down ?
so that &apos;s what i did .
and to do that , they need a western education .
i met a@@ gn@@ es three years ago in the ri@@ ft valley .
i don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s tru@@ th@@ ful .
thank you .
you could even get your own hi@@ ve if you want .
i have strategi@@ cally cut ma@@ tt &apos;s head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the swe@@ at@@ su@@ its .
for example , you are sitting in las vegas , and you &apos;re be@@ tting , and you let the other guys pe@@ ek this card by mistake . feel , it &apos;s just the regular , one card .
for example , how we started : rat@@ an just began with a five-@@ engineer team , young people in their mi@@ d-@@ t@@ wen@@ ties .
and that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
that &apos;s not so surprising .
it &apos;s almost like they get heavy . they get massive .
&quot; we hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equal . &quot;
now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
so , the different elements of comics , like pictures and words , and the different symb@@ ols and everything in between that comics pres@@ ents are all fun@@ nel@@ ed through the single condu@@ it of vision .
he asked me if i wanted to interview the red briga@@ des .
nothing . nothing .
the great des@@ car@@ tes said something quite similar .
and , ultimately , the ari@@ thme@@ tic problem isn &apos;t going to go away .
why does go@@ li@@ ath not re@@ act to that ?
now , there &apos;s one big change since the com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty bo@@ oms of the 197@@ 0s , and that is the spread of democracy .
and it might happen the opposite , the other way around . so i really enjoy creating , like , sound portra@@ its of people .
to produce these anima@@ tions , an anima@@ tor at a studio has to anti@@ ci@@ pate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to anima@@ te that particular sequence .
and i said , no , you really ought to study brains . they said , oh , you know , you &apos;re wrong . and i said , no , you &apos;re wrong , and i didn &apos;t get in .
and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger ene@@ my .
you can just go on solar@@ impul@@ se@@ .com , sub@@ scri@@ be to just be infor@@ med of what we &apos;re doing .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people particip@@ ating , creating millions of vie@@ ws .
they were just there , but they had no signifi@@ can@@ ce .
one out of 10 are saving enough .
and again , some of these may be far@@ -@@ fet@@ ched , but i figured if there &apos;s anywhere to present far@@ -@@ fet@@ ched ideas , it &apos;s here at ted , so thank you very much .
there are so many things you can do , but ultimately this is about something really simple .
they would just take a stick and a cat@@ gut and str@@ ing it up .
i mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organization , we are sort of over@@ whel@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quanti@@ ty of whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clos@@ ures of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
all of this information is rela@@ tively available .
their dna is to find the conditions that are condu@@ ci@@ ve to life .
you know , if you &apos;re working with a pa@@ tho@@ gen , you &apos;re not part of the bio@@ hac@@ ker community , you &apos;re part of the bi@@ ot@@ err@@ or@@ ist community , i &apos;m sorry .
hopefully i might get something a bit more dra@@ matic and roman@@ tic before i die .
but many people today -- philosop@@ hers , artists , doctors , scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call the third act , the last three decades of life .
so , if you have a ham bu@@ tt problem , and you &apos;re thinking about the ham bu@@ tt problem , the conclu@@ sion that it leads you to is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able and counter@@ intui@@ tive : paper is the ene@@ my of words .
so this is charles &apos; voice .
and so we had , as was the nor@@ m , li@@ ve-@@ in dom@@ esti@@ c help , who would often come from near@@ by rural villages .
it &apos;s so hard to pos@@ t some sensitive words on the chinese weib@@ o .
the future that in@@ tel &apos;s working on now is to figure out how to make that compu@@ ting for person@@ alized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours , and make this kind of tool available , not just in the ma@@ infra@@ mes of tier@@ -@@ one research hospitals around the world , but in the main@@ stream -- every patient , every clinic with access to whole genome sequ@@ en@@ cing .
that &apos;s 200 wat@@ t-@@ hours .
and this is not an ide@@ alized version . these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being im@@ ple@@ mented , at least for public security .
another , another three-@@ dig@@ it -- -- another three-@@ dig@@ it number , sir ?
the key is to over@@ come what &apos;s called func@@ tional fix@@ e@@ dness .
tropic@@ al ra@@ infor@@ est@@ s ar@@ ose , spar@@ king new la@@ yers of inter@@ dependence .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s fortun@@ es are cor@@ related .
students love that t@@ dp . they think it &apos;s the name of a video game .
in a few months , the world is also going to cele@@ bra@@ te the la@@ unch of a new invention from microsoft research , which i think is going to have as pro@@ found an impact on the way we view the universe as g@@ ali@@ le@@ o did four centuries ago .
she goes village to village doing scre@@ en@@ ings .
it &apos;s going to cost us 10 billion . and we &apos;ll produce half a gi@@ ga@@ watt of fu@@ sion power .
por@@ tu@@ g@@ al was able to con@@ soli@@ date its frag@@ mented school system , raise quality and improve equ@@ ity , and so did h@@ ung@@ ary .
and it doesn &apos;t just apply to compu@@ tation .
these predi@@ ctions are in exc@@ ell@@ ent agre@@ ement with ob@@ serva@@ tions by the w@@ map satellite of the cos@@ mic micro@@ wave background , which is an im@@ print of the very early universe .
can of wh@@ up ass , the net@@ working force .
so this is an@@ at@@ o@@ mage table . thank you .
wrong .
so many times , ama@@ teur@@ s , not experts , have been the inv@@ ent@@ ors and impro@@ vers of things ran@@ ging from mountain bikes to se@@ mi@@ condu@@ ctors , personal computers , air@@ plan@@ es .
it &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
then i saw our chan@@ c@@ ell@@ or coming to school in den@@ ims and tur@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks , and i thought , not right for me to keep this other .
lg : it was after the blin@@ d@@ fold .
it shows up at places like mit , and then a mu@@ tation happens .
we have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without nee@@ ding re@@ plac@@ ement .
this is what it looks like today .
we &apos;ve created systems , which syste@@ matically privi@@ lege , en@@ courage , one nar@@ row quad@@ r@@ ant of the human soul and left the others un@@ regar@@ ded .
that &apos;s why invest@@ ments by gates foundation , un@@ ic@@ e@@ f and aid organi@@ zations , together with national government in the poor@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world .
and suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
and i would argu@@ e that it &apos;s possibly more effective than the original bil@@ l@@ board in terms of getting your attention , getting you to look over that way .
peter par@@ ker : standing on the pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce , i can so@@ ar away from this . j@@ t : we &apos;re trying to do everything in live theater that you can &apos;t do in two dimen@@ sions in film and television .
but , at the time , in the 13@@ th century , it was the g@@ ad@@ get of the day .
the problem is the person or person@@ s using it .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an inter@@ mission in my talk .
but this is why , you know , they &apos;re not in the qu@@ eu@@ e behind you at the gro@@ cer@@ y store or the at@@ m -- you know , they don &apos;t do this stuff .
and so there were many , many of these kinds of projects .
they are cultural cre@@ ations , not natural phenomena .
so all the people i used to know in brooklyn , they said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
it also provi@@ des a special hab@@ it@@ at for these flying fish to lay their eggs .
and so she can &apos;t move out .
and now it &apos;s just limited to a couple of spots in ne@@ p@@ al and india .
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn &apos;t p@@ an out .
but we want to use our brain !
he was dra@@ g@@ ging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the l@@ ord .
the next po@@ em is called for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful@@ ness , and it &apos;s really just a kind of po@@ e@@ tic es@@ say on the subject of mental sli@@ p@@ page .
and it was ok . one more ?
in bli@@ zz@@ ard win@@ ds , the cre@@ w s@@ ling rop@@ es between the t@@ ents so that people can feel their way saf@@ ely to the near@@ est ice house and to the near@@ est ou@@ thou@@ se .
what do you do ? do you pull the patient back and try i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ?
and this is a video that was taken by my sur@@ gi@@ cal ment@@ or , dr. john ni@@ par@@ ko , who im@@ planted her .
di@@ ana rei@@ s@@ s : you may think you &apos;re looking through a window at a dol@@ ph@@ in spinn@@ ing play@@ fully , but what you &apos;re actually looking through is a two-@@ way mi@@ r@@ ror at a dol@@ ph@@ in looking at itself spinn@@ ing play@@ fully .
if you zo@@ om in here , you can see north korea , in out@@ line here , which is like a black hole compared to its neigh@@ b@@ ors .
this one doesn &apos;t have the video in it , but you get a little feel from what it can do .
in fact , if you look just at the upp@@ er and northern states in the west , they could do geo@@ ther@@ mal , or you could look at texas and say , we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid .
okay ? so i want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many sym@@ me@@ tries there are .
we can also see the super@@ stars . these would be the people that are kind of the lo@@ om@@ ing heroes and hero@@ ines in the universe of bill clinton . so there &apos;s bill clinton , h@@ ill@@ ary , iraq , george bush , bar@@ ack ob@@ ama , s@@ co@@ ot@@ er li@@ b@@ by -- these are kind of the people of bill clinton .
you think that &apos;s cool .
if you look at the oec@@ d countries and how much they spend per dom@@ esti@@ c poor person , and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries , the ra@@ ti@@ o — bran@@ ko mil@@ an@@ o@@ vi@@ c at the world bank did the calcul@@ ations — turns out to be about 3@@ 0,000 to one .
this is another case where a theor@@ e@@ tical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the ger@@ m theory of disease .
so this is the motor .
and i think that the difference between what i call the survival level of living , the success level of living and the significant level of living is , do you figure out , what on earth am i here for ?
this is a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical ad .
think of it in terms of diab@@ et@@ es , for instance .
even when they &apos;re thinking about something they would describe as pleas@@ ant , they &apos;re actually just slightly less happy than when they aren &apos;t min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing .
the electricity power@@ ing the lights in this theater was gener@@ ated just moments ago .
it &apos;s a hand@@ y-@@ d@@ and@@ y quote from hip@@ po@@ cr@@ ates of the hip@@ po@@ cra@@ tic o@@ ath that says , &quot; the greater part of the soul la@@ ys outside the body , treatment of the inner requ@@ ires treatment of the ou@@ ter . &quot;
and that has been the second great -- couple 10@@ 0,000 years , 15@@ 0,000 years -- by changing our environment , we put new pres@@ sur@@ es on our bodies to evol@@ ve .
question for you , k@@ w@@ aben@@ a .
with more base stations , more ground stations , better recei@@ vers and better algorith@@ ms , gps can now not only tell you what street you are on , but what part of the street .
i &apos;m going to discus@@ s with you three of my inven@@ tions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people , which we will hope to see happen .
art , in the plat@@ on@@ ic sense , is truth ; it &apos;s beauty , and love .
this may be one of the ultimate pap@@ ers .
they don &apos;t sh@@ y away from infrastructure .
if you look at the good projects , a lot of san@@ itation and water projects came in .
and hon@@ est@@ ly , even though i love the designs that we were building , i was always fri@@ gh@@ tened that i wouldn &apos;t really love it , because i fell in love with that wild@@ scape -- and how could you re@@ create that magic ?
i &apos;m not looking for a pen p@@ al .
unfortunately , it has become ob@@ so@@ le@@ te because it was designed for at@@ ar@@ i plat@@ form .
and isn &apos;t it a little strange that he required no pay@@ ment for this ?
i hadn &apos;t changed . my i.@@ q@@ . hadn &apos;t dropped .
you want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size ?
and that &apos;s why i suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it .
think of the diversity of the web . it &apos;s a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
so it &apos;s like the different la@@ yers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identi@@ ty .
and this metaph@@ or in my head -- i got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ peti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
he went to new york ; he went to chicago ; he went to j@@ ack@@ son@@ vil@@ le ; he went to los angeles . and he brought in people by the tru@@ ck@@ load . into big hall@@ s .
and when &quot; sch@@ in@@ d@@ ler &apos;s list &quot; dem@@ anded that they never forget , one child , full of the pain of consciousness , re@@ mar@@ ked , &quot; we already for@@ got , otherwise how did &apos; hotel rwand@@ a &apos; happen ? &quot;
somebody , some people -- and i saw somebody kind of make the motion over here -- some people have a great idea where they light the mat@@ ch , melt the side of the cand@@ le , try to ad@@ here it to the wall .
and i looked in the eyes of my little grand@@ children , and think how much we &apos;ve har@@ med this planet since i was their age .
i looked at it . i was really surprised .
if you change the gras@@ p , it can ad@@ just to that .
well we have two obje@@ ctive meas@@ ures .
peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero-@@ sum game couldn &apos;t work .
you call them stock , or stock op@@ tions , deri@@ va@@ tives , mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge-@@ bac@@ ked securi@@ ties .
the self was not const@@ ant .
i went to so@@ ko@@ to in northern nigeria to try and find out how far away it is .
so they got very interested in producing con@@ vul@@ sions , measu@@ red types of con@@ vul@@ sions .
what was i supposed to accomp@@ li@@ sh in this final act ?
ev@@ a ver@@ tes -- only 19 when she gave this talk -- discus@@ ses her journey toward studying medicine and her drive to understand the roots of cancer and alzheimer &apos;s .
they &apos;re both wonderful and largely the same , except that computers happened in between .
even though it &apos;s solid , i &apos;m standing away .
you could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week , but at the end of the week , you had to get the hom@@ e@@ work done .
so , in this office , you do not work anymore at your des@@ k , like a poli@@ tician .
it is like a tube where a wo@@ unded soldier en@@ ters on one end and ex@@ its back home , on the other .
because -- notice the por@@ ch here .
how are we going to solve climate change through negoti@@ ations , unless we are able to make civil society and people , not part of the problem , but part of the solution ?
you know ? where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew ar@@ ose from the potential for earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , as well as the potential for climate change ?
what it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the u@@ k does , near a hal@@ f-@@ million sur@@ ger@@ ies as a whole country .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s passed on from person to person .
and probably for most people in this room , that &apos;s how you think about it .
tra@@ cy ch@@ ev@@ ali@@ er : finding the story inside the pain@@ ting
and when you think about this , that we &apos;re running through the united states with dynam@@ ite and rock sa@@ ws so that an algorith@@ m can close the deal three micros@@ econ@@ ds faster , all for a communications fra@@ me@@ work that no human will ever know , that &apos;s a kind of mani@@ fest dest@@ iny ; and we &apos;ll always look for a new fron@@ tier .
and government has many ways in which it could impact the will@@ ing@@ ness and the ability of companies to com@@ pe@@ te in this way .
they have low in@@ comes . and they benef@@ it from cheap , aff@@ ord@@ able , safe and diver@@ se food .
we also have da@@ ve hac@@ ken@@ berg , who is the poster child of c@@ c@@ d .
the only creatures that have got conscious control of their bre@@ ath are the di@@ ving animals and the di@@ ving bir@@ ds .
cause you &apos;re either a victi@@ m , or on top , like me .
so , now i will demonstrate different ways of memor@@ i@@ zing , control car@@ ds and so on .
i took this down to ground zero , and kno@@ cked my way through crow@@ ds for an hour .
and this made me think that perhaps the don@@ or agen@@ cies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
then , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 25 percent of all patients never have any symp@@ tom@@ s .
in the other trials , they &apos;re told , you &apos;re playing a computer .
and then i asked him a question , which i ended up asking to all the da@@ ds and ended up really en@@ coura@@ ging me to write this story down in a book .
up there is the skelet@@ on , which is actually what it &apos;s trying to do .
you know ? you only get one bir@@ th@@ day per year .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
but they asked me for a promise basically .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the inher@@ ent su@@ gar tr@@ apped in the star@@ ch .
the p@@ ine ri@@ dge reser@@ vation , the subject of today &apos;s slide show , is lo@@ cated about 75 miles sou@@ the@@ ast of the black h@@ ills in south da@@ kot@@ a .
this is how it actually works .
and at that moment , when i heard that , i just got cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted out of the sub@@ way car into a night when i had been getting a ride in an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce from the side@@ walk where i had been stab@@ bed to the trauma room of st. vin@@ cent &apos;s hospital in manhattan , and what had happened was a gang had come in from brooklyn .
i had a degree from cambridge ; i had a thri@@ ving career , but my self was a car cr@@ ash , and i wo@@ und up with bu@@ li@@ mi@@ a and on a therap@@ ist &apos;s cou@@ ch .
he had a bad leg , a cir@@ cul@@ atory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to walk the course .
i went around toronto and found a ba@@ th@@ tu@@ b like my grand@@ mother &apos;s , and i put the fish in .
so in a program called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant we &apos;ve actually gone from ireland to canada , from cor@@ si@@ ca to spa@@ in .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning i went and vis@@ ited them .
i know many religions are so anxi@@ ous about preser@@ ving the pu@@ ri@@ ty of their fa@@ it@@ h among their children that they are in@@ tent on keeping their children ignor@@ ant of other fa@@ i@@ ths .
really ? you should have brought a picture . that &apos;s wonderful .
and everything &apos;s auto@@ ma@@ ted at the other end .
but it works , and it even has some health re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions .
i want to talk about to@@ ys , and the power that i see inher@@ ent in them .
so again , this is another one of those play@@ ful activi@@ ties that , as we get older , we tend to forget and we have to rele@@ ar@@ n .
that &apos;s called &quot; ad@@ her@@ ence . &quot;
the second , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re that close .
and a month into it , i come to the office , and i have this e@@ mail from one of our students .
you can work it out on a piece of paper in a labor@@ atory , get a teles@@ cope , s@@ wing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.@@ 4 times the mass of the sun .
now , what if my ro@@ om@@ mate knew about my friend f@@ um@@ i on@@ da , a fe@@ ar@@ less woman who ho@@ sts a tv show in la@@ gos , and is determined to tell the stories that we pre@@ fer to forget ?
if we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
now here , our entire oceans are ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ating off the surface , and as it keeps getting hot@@ ter at some point the entire planet &apos;s going to melt down .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ t@@ mouth medical school , li@@ s@@ a schwar@@ tz and steven wol@@ os@@ hin .
so i believe this kept me running .
what happens is that you set the tag to deta@@ ch from the shark after a fixed period , in this case it was eight months , and literally to the day the tag pop@@ ped off , dri@@ f@@ ted up , said h@@ ello to the satellite and sent , not all the data , but enough data for us to use .
and then she says , &quot; not one of our girls . &quot;
so we talk about p@@ mt@@ ct , and we re@@ fer to p@@ mt@@ ct , pre@@ vention of mother to child trans@@ mission .
mean@@ while , i use these sc@@ or@@ es as blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts to translate into sc@@ ulp@@ tural forms like this , that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visu@@ alization , but now they &apos;re em@@ bed@@ ding the visual matrix of the musical sc@@ ore , so it can actually be read as a musical sc@@ ore .
cities are the cru@@ ci@@ ble of civilization .
tar@@ yn sim@@ on cap@@ tures the essen@@ ce of vast , gener@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ span@@ ning stories by photograph@@ ing the des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of people at the center of the nar@@ ra@@ tive . in this ri@@ v@@ eting talk she shows a stream of these stories from all over the world , investig@@ ating the nature of gene@@ alo@@ g@@ y and the way our lives are shap@@ ed by the inter@@ play of many different forces .
and she was like , &quot; well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot;
we will not be there .
ris@@ ks to create spaces that have never been can@@ ti@@ lever@@ ed to that ex@@ tent .
a few kilome@@ ters , maybe , is quite typical .
it &apos;s always about taste .
then there are a few little re@@ actions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
can you break your culture of sil@@ ence ?
for those who can &apos;t walk , who are un@@ able to get there right now , people started to organize wal@@ ks in cities , in their own communities .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 bal@@ lo@@ ons , and some really sad soul holding one bal@@ lo@@ on .
because i think stories are vital here .
thank you .
so i had all these no@@ tions . this was back in the late &apos; 9@@ 0s , and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy , but a lot of people then went on and actually did it .
i bought some su@@ per sc@@ ul@@ pe@@ ys , some ar@@ ma@@ ture wire , some various materials .
over the course of the 24 months , the first two years that we really focused on , this is a map of every word he learned in chron@@ ological order .
i like this for a couple of reasons .
so far , this is enough tox@@ in to cover the face of lake e@@ er@@ ie a foot deep .
this is just an ex@@ cer@@ pt from one of those letters .
immediately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
so here we are , at a very micros@@ cop@@ ic scale , swimming around . and i actually realize that cells don &apos;t have eyes , but it helps to make it cute .
the only thing they have in common is that they &apos;re different .
in a nu@@ t@@ shell that &apos;s what happened ?
the glas@@ s-@@ ste@@ ag@@ all act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the re@@ cession to happen , and the bank mel@@ t@@ down and all that stuff that required the ba@@ il@@ ou@@ ts -- that was put in effect in 193@@ 3 , was syste@@ matically destro@@ yed .
it &apos;s called break@@ bone fe@@ ver , because that &apos;s how you can feel .
the bad news is there is no fire briga@@ de .
in pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia it costs 6@@ 0,000 dollars to keep people in ja@@ il , most of whom look like me .
the other major nar@@ ra@@ tive of social dilemm@@ as is the tragedy of the common@@ s .
in cle@@ vel@@ and , there &apos;s bur@@ n@@ ham mall , on the left .
the survey takes over a day .
we can apply different fol@@ ding ra@@ ti@@ os to different parts of the form to create local conditions .
not only can you say how many notes , it &apos;s being able to play them all at the same time . here we are .
and what this data represents for our family at a personal level , the impact has already been immen@@ se , and we &apos;re still learning its value .
and really so i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that the way you protect your priv@@ acy , particularly in an era where everything is cat@@ alo@@ ged and everything is archi@@ ved and everything is recorded , there &apos;s no need to dele@@ te information anymore .
but if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inher@@ it both mu@@ tations from different lin@@ e@@ ages .
and i said , &quot; char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , it sounds pretty interesting to me . &quot;
lg : six -- six with the th@@ um@@ b .
i thought , at the time , i did a pretty good job .
not meaning it kind of si@@ ts around inside cells going , &quot; i want to get cop@@ i@@ ed . &quot;
it &apos;s basically a measure of how many ti@@ gers , to@@ ads , ti@@ cks or whatever on average of bio@@ mass of various species are around .
i saw it fir@@ sth@@ and .
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a buck@@ y@@ ball , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
this is a qui@@ z . what do you think ?
who pre@@ f@@ ers the who@@ le-@@ me@@ al bre@@ ad ?
it &apos;s got a f@@ an , it &apos;s got head@@ lights for war@@ m@@ th , it &apos;s got door chim@@ es for al@@ arm -- it runs off a car battery .
but as you can also see , proje@@ cted going forward , the ga@@ p wi@@ den@@ s a bit and rais@@ es a bit , and this graph is only through 20@@ 21 .
well , it wasn &apos;t that long ago we were asking , &quot; well , what would anyone do with a personal computer ? &quot;
i ended up at this really fan@@ cy party .
they are highly re@@ active , and they are super@@ -@@ plastic , and so the auti@@ sts are probably cap@@ able of building and learning a symph@@ ony which is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for us .
thank you !
so today i &apos;m going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic , and i &apos;m actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know .
l@@ -@@ dop@@ a &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for tre@@ ating par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , which is related to a de@@ cre@@ ase in dop@@ am@@ ine .
it &apos;s hard to tell where to start , there &apos;s so many great things .
and i said , &quot; sir , i do . &quot;
that &apos;s a man heart attack .
he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa , one man with an unbelie@@ vable sense of his humanity .
and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent infe@@ cti@@ ous diseases like clo@@ stri@@ di@@ um diff@@ i@@ ci@@ le infe@@ ctions that can stay with people for years and years and years .
and instead of sharing money , they become sel@@ fish .
it contro@@ ls all foreign media and image production outside of china from foreign media working within china .
people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of di@@ eter ra@@ ms , and the objects that he would create for the company called brau@@ n .
you want to see god .
but i just like it in bright orange .
and in fact , cotton would take up to 18 di@@ ps in indi@@ go to achieve a color this dark .
some fair@@ y tal@@ es have happy end@@ ings . some don &apos;t .
so what do you do ?
you can go and buy some of the great tun@@ es .
this is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ o@@ fing the ro@@ of . &quot;
and i think now you &apos;re seeing the move towards impro@@ ving our cities .
it would have broken his heart .
&quot; you &apos;re not going to have dinner at all ? &quot;
ok , there is my childhood church , that &apos;s specific . there &apos;s some more , fort coll@@ ins .
he had to for@@ go all the farm activi@@ ties .
i &apos;d like to take an example of a contro@@ versi@@ al use of a market mechanism , a cash in@@ cen@@ tive , and see what you think about it .
and the way they bar@@ ga@@ in is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars , and they &apos;re bar@@ ga@@ ining over how much the un@@ infor@@ med player gets , and the infor@@ med player &apos;s going to get the rest .
you can make the baby po@@ op .
well , this is the question the edge foundation asked this year , and four of the respon@@ d@@ ents said , &quot; seti . &quot;
and isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
back in about 2000 , i was living in brooklyn , i was trying to finish my first book , i was wander@@ ing around da@@ zed every day because i wrote from 12 a.@@ m. to 5 a.@@ m .
if you live up here , in summer the sun is coming fair@@ ly directly down , but in winter it &apos;s coming through a huge amount of atmosphere , and much of the ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is wee@@ ded out , and the range of wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths that hit the earth are different from summer to winter .
and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
what was interesting about the article was people started comm@@ enting on the article , rea@@ ders of the thing .
and these mu@@ tations ac@@ cum@@ ulate appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely as a function of time .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
it just becomes in@@ toler@@ able .
thank you .
and i could not dis@@ agree more .
so i &apos;m going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-@@ assem@@ bling future .
and you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . there was no time to waste .
we connect the dots : a is connected to b ; b is connected to c .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible . &quot;
absolutely not .
and guess what ?
a group of men mar@@ ch through the streets cu@@ tting themselves with kni@@ ves .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
on the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they &apos;re mixed popul@@ ations .
i can &apos;t get these parents to come to the school . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk about those looking for great jobs , great care@@ ers , and why you &apos;re going to , why you &apos;re going to fa@@ il .
but he hasn &apos;t paid his r@@ ent , of course , because he &apos;s paying for his hiv medi@@ cation and just can &apos;t afford both .
again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equ@@ ation .
and finally he says , &quot; ok , now i &apos;m going to -- &quot; all of the au@@ ra get er@@ ased with an appropri@@ ately placed magnetic pul@@ se .
this was what china looked like with the vi@@ ctory of the q@@ in dy@@ na@@ sty in 2@@ 21 b@@ .@@ c. at the end of the war@@ ring@@ -@@ state period -- the birth of modern china .
they are com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed .
thank you .
china just launched a national tissu@@ e-@@ engineering center .
&quot; what is the obje@@ ctive of the consu@@ mer ? &quot;
you will then pay , how long is a typical le@@ ase ?
now , what stephen haw@@ king mentioned , as well , is that after the big ban@@ g , space exp@@ anded at a very rap@@ id rate .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang pu@@ ck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
we can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re sub@@ conscious for us .
the video game industry in 200@@ 5 became a 2@@ 9 billion dollar business .
they want to have the discipline and accoun@@ t@@ ability .
i like it .
now , simil@@ arly , the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it , it would be expensive , or we would have done it already , because markets are essentially perfect .
they were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of protein served with cop@@ i@@ ous quanti@@ ties of vege@@ tab@@ les and small amounts of star@@ ch , usually rice .
we can then choose , from among a range of op@@ tions , the best one .
over 500 ent@@ ries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion .
and by the mi@@ d-@@ 60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the stanford research lab in california .
i wanted to up@@ date what i &apos;ve been doing since then -- but it &apos;s still the same the@@ me song -- and introdu@@ ce you to my lab and current work , which is the environmental health clinic that i run at n@@ y@@ u .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete pri@@ macy of one over the other .
so i actually developed a pro@@ pos@@ al to go out with a car@@ go ship and two de@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed fis@@ hing tra@@ w@@ lers , a cr@@ ane , a chi@@ pping machine and a col@@ d-@@ mol@@ ding machine .
and compu@@ tation , stor@@ age and communications capacity are in the hands of prac@@ tically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet .
and this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to cat@@ ch up .
now , i still enjo@@ yed the frag@@ ment@@ ation of poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ sm , seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this uni@@ fied whole .
i think th@@ u@@ cy@@ di@@ des really spo@@ ke to us very clearly in 4@@ 30 b@@ .@@ c. he put it ni@@ c@@ ely .
to understand what that means , let &apos;s look at the lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ based classroom , and let &apos;s pick the medi@@ an performance as a threshold .
but when more and more people go to beijing , they also cause the risk of a revolution .
when this tra@@ iler showed up at my shop in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , i &apos;d actually never ste@@ pped foot in an air@@ stream tra@@ iler , or any other tra@@ iler .
thank you . sustainable solutions -- this was my first company .
n@@ ina j@@ ab@@ lon@@ sk@@ i : skin color is an illusion
this is not a five-@@ minute pit@@ ch . this is , you know , two sent@@ ences .
this is r@@ alp@@ h stanley .
what &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
so when steve jobs talks to 5@@ 0,000 people at his key@@ note , right , who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-@@ hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 5@@ 0,000 people care des@@ perat@@ ely enough to watch a two-@@ hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
you don &apos;t do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
he would definitely say , &quot; god came down from heaven , and he said un@@ to the cow , &apos; tho@@ u sh@@ alt cross the road . &apos; and cow cros@@ sed the road , and there was much re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing as a hol@@ y cow . &quot;
re@@ start the treatment , los@@ es the weight again .
so let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
the people &apos;s super@@ market .
and e@@ me@@ ka and i have had these discus@@ sions .
what do we learn from that ?
i looked for temporary materials , like spit@@ ting out food -- — side@@ walk ch@@ al@@ k and even fro@@ zen w@@ ine .
we should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves .
this is really , in fact , a television broad@@ ca@@ sting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
my mother had been cele@@ br@@ ating my bir@@ th@@ day with me , without me .
if you &apos;re interested in what it costs -- i &apos;m not s@@ elling them today -- but this unit , with the electr@@ on@@ ics and everything , if you buy one , is around a thousand bucks .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
so as we eat , the camera starts pulling out , and then we start inter@@ acting with kind of larger and larger organis@@ ms .
this is an image from satur@@ day , photograph@@ ed by the aqu@@ a satellite , but through the uni@@ view software .
what does that mean ?
not that many people are looking to pop open their one re@@ ma@@ ining bottle for a journalist .
but i was off on as@@ sign@@ ment .
i called my friends , pain@@ ted on their bodies , and had them dance in front of a pain@@ ting .
and over there i experi@@ enced other people &apos;s suffering , up close and personal , immer@@ sed myself in some rather inten@@ se and emo@@ tional stories , and at times i experi@@ enced great fear for my own life .
but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al thing , and i was raised to be an entrepreneur , and what i &apos;ve been really passionate about ever since -- and i &apos;ve never spo@@ ken about this ever , until now -- so this is the first time anyone &apos;s ever heard it , except my wife three days ago , because she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; and i told her -- is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al tra@@ its , and to gro@@ om them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing .
and they ta@@ sted really good .
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ tern@@ al , om@@ ni@@ present , all-@@ powerful .
instead of blo@@ wing a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e of chil@@ led air through the stadium , we can use radi@@ ant cool@@ ing technologies , like a flo@@ or he@@ ating system where water pi@@ p@@ es are em@@ bed@@ ded in the flo@@ or .
civil wars have made news head@@ lines for many decades now , and eth@@ ni@@ c confli@@ cts in particular have been a near const@@ ant presence as a major international security threat .
a second argument would be : because it was sitting on a sto@@ ve with the fl@@ ame on -- that &apos;s an historical argument .
and what i &apos;d like to discus@@ s today is the need to over@@ hau@@ l and simpli@@ fy the law to rele@@ ase the energy and passion of americans , so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society .
now that i &apos;ve done that -- i &apos;ll explain it in a moment -- i must tell you that i am an actor .
it was here that i had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what i call the &quot; repres@@ ent@@ ative foreig@@ ner . &quot;
focus on what &apos;s dig@@ ni@@ fied , coura@@ ge@@ ous and beautiful , and it gro@@ ws . thank you .
he was the china repres@@ ent@@ ative for the american so@@ ybe@@ an associ@@ ation .
the bi@@ ologists continued to be skep@@ tical of the long-@@ range communication issue well past the &apos; 7@@ 0s , until the end of the cold war .
now i hope all of you feel better .
i can tell you it &apos;s a ma@@ gnifi@@ cent spread .
it &apos;s like a wir@@ eless acceler@@ om@@ eter , pe@@ dom@@ eter .
so once you see this -- once you see that liber@@ als and conserva@@ tives both have something to contribu@@ te , that they form a balance on change versus st@@ ability -- then i think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix .
i will show you this next thing , speaking of co@@ st@@ umes for oper@@ as .
if you come in you will see us : ev@@ ening time , at table -- set for ten but not always all se@@ ats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served .
and it is cru@@ cial -- it is cru@@ cial in a practical , ac@@ tivist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their pre@@ ferences , their choices and their voices to en@@ courage that out@@ come .
and it &apos;s health@@ ier than the united states .
the bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
hi , everybody .
i always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
i sent him to the store , which was my first mistake , and he went to buy under@@ wear , and he bought the grip@@ pers , and he &apos;s supposed to buy the bo@@ x@@ ers . &quot;
but traditional in@@ cu@@ bat@@ ors require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars .
so , what we see with empath@@ y and respect , lots of really hope@@ ful things that have come out of this re@@ cession .
i used the d@@ ust at the whit@@ ney museum to ren@@ der some pieces of their collection .
oh , thank you .
don &apos;t be h@@ ass@@ an . don &apos;t be hus@@ sein . &quot;
ar@@ thri@@ tis and injury gr@@ ind down millions of jo@@ in@@ ts , but few get the best reme@@ dy -- real biological tissue . k@@ ev@@ in stone shows a treatment that could side@@ step the high costs and don@@ or shor@@ t@@ fall of human@@ -@@ to-@@ human transplan@@ ts with a novel use of animal tissue .
suff@@ er@@ ers of cap@@ gras syndro@@ me believe that the people they love most in the world have been re@@ placed by perfect du@@ pli@@ c@@ ates .
but if you go to authority , and you always don &apos;t -- you don &apos;t always get the right answer , see .
and so how did you handle that ?
well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lo@@ wer@@ -@@ midd@@ le-@@ class .
thank you .
i was down@@ sta@@ irs by the front door , and i was waiting for a tax@@ i , and my son came down the sta@@ irs and he &apos;d made a card for me . and he was car@@ rying it .
it extra@@ cts regi@@ ons with dark contr@@ ast , which will show up on the video as red .
and then finally , what i &apos;ve been trying to do here is create a really immer@@ sive experience for kids , where they really feel like they are part of that story , a part of that experience .
and he s@@ hr@@ ug@@ ged it off , i think he either thought i was just com@@ pla@@ ining a lot , or it was the typical m@@ .@@ d. &quot; nothing can be wrong with my children . &quot;
let &apos;s start with faster .
i mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able and bio@@ com@@ pati@@ ble .
computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means .
somebody from india would know , of course .
but for me , it doesn &apos;t . that is a wonderful thing .
are we in the middle of something un@@ usual histor@@ ically in your op@@ ini@@ on ?
so one demon@@ stration of this was done with young children .
you know , i think that there &apos;s a big parallel between ben@@ ding the cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ x out of shape and creating swa@@ sti@@ kas .
and something that motiv@@ ates me , and what gets me really excited about my research , is when i see simple opportunities to dra@@ st@@ ically change that distribution and make the technology acc@@ essi@@ ble to a much wider per@@ cent@@ age of the population .
if we take many images of many sli@@ ces of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
com@@ mend@@ able : a site that allows parents to give their kids little bad@@ ges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do -- like t@@ ying their shoes .
remember that moment ? it felt so good , didn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s one thing you americans take for granted , you know ?
students , in turn , continu@@ ously move outside the classroom to enga@@ ge the world directly .
but the simple act of kin@@ dness from a complete str@@ an@@ ger will un@@ st@@ it@@ ch you . &quot;
tom han@@ ks : h@@ ello , hou@@ ston , this is o@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y .
with our streng@@ ths and our minds and spirit , we ga@@ ther , we form , and we fashion .
this is on a mer@@ c@@ ator proje@@ ction .
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and fig@@ ures , and they say , &quot; i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
of course , the real importance for be@@ es is not the hon@@ ey .
his core temperature had dropped to 7@@ 7 degrees .
when i &apos;m starting talks like this , i usually do a whole spiel about sustain@@ ability because a lot of people out there don &apos;t know what that is .
and then i was a mas@@ se@@ use . and then i was a landscape gar@@ den@@ er .
that &apos;s all the time i have , so thank you very much for your attention .
i spent the better part of a decade looking at american respon@@ ses to mass at@@ ro@@ city and genocide .
again , like i said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , ob@@ tain@@ ing them , appreci@@ ating them and di@@ ving into them .
but before i do , i just want you to pon@@ der this graph for a moment .
each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identi@@ fied .
so i found the best people to work with are physici@@ sts , engineers and mathema@@ ticians , who tend to think algorith@@ mi@@ cally .
and i &apos;ve met with some of these people .
i don &apos;t know how they did it .
and i remember when i was 12 years old , and i started playing ty@@ mp@@ an@@ i and per@@ cus@@ sion , and my teacher said , &quot; well , how are we going to do this ? you know , music is about listening . &quot;
the complexity here is unbelie@@ vable .
the little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , chri@@ stop@@ her colum@@ bus cros@@ sed the atlan@@ tic .
and in the end , it &apos;s this word , &quot; engagement , &quot; that i want to leave you with .
ah , a@@ vari@@ cious heaven !
when he realized his wife had to choose between buying family me@@ als and buying her mon@@ th@@ ly &quot; supp@@ lies , &quot; ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mur@@ u@@ gan@@ anth@@ am vo@@ wed to help her solve the problem of the san@@ it@@ ary pad . his research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model .
temp@@ le , can i just say it &apos;s an absolute de@@ light to have you at ted .
a couple of quick rules to w@@ rap up .
they may be mountains , but they may be just formul@@ a@@ e , just cran@@ ked on .
now , i &apos;m going to move now from this kind of -- the su@@ bli@@ me in the traditional sense of the word , that is to say , a@@ we@@ -@@ inspi@@ ring , terri@@ fying -- to the some@@ what more m@@ und@@ ane .
he &apos;s out over the chan@@ nel .
in any case , the cameras sho@@ ot roughly every hour .
one of the fascinating things about the blog@@ osph@@ ere speci@@ fi@@ cally , and , of course , the internet more gener@@ ally -- and it &apos;s going to seem like a very obvious point , but i think it is an important one to think about -- is that the people who are gener@@ ating these enormous re@@ ams of content every day , who are spending enormous amounts of time organi@@ zing , lin@@ king , comm@@ enting on the sub@@ stance of the internet , are doing so pri@@ mar@@ ily for free .
to@@ d@@ d ku@@ i@@ ken : okay , so after your am@@ putation , you heal@@ ed up .
he said , &quot; you are beautiful . you have grown into a gor@@ ge@@ ous woman .
that is about as high as you can get .
you were totally and completely in touch with your inner super@@ hero .
a hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechan@@ ics of the car and how the ig@@ ni@@ tion ti@@ ming worked and all sorts of things .
she s@@ ells cho@@ col@@ ates .
it &apos;s about car@@ ving out a space for trees .
they are , according to the lat@@ est g@@ all@@ up world pol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est nation on the planet -- than anybody ; more than swi@@ tzer@@ land and den@@ mark .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
take the analy@@ tical fra@@ me@@ works , the cap@@ abilities you have , apply them to old fe@@ ars .
the question is : what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture , and what &apos;s it going to mean for women ?
and he called the two of them to his office .
r@@ f : so if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have sp@@ ines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
when we look at the universi@@ ties , 60 percent of bac@@ cal@@ au@@ re@@ ate degrees are going to women now , which is a significant shift .
here india can look at what is happening in the west and el@@ sewhere , and look at what needs to be done .
we dres@@ sed a co@@ w@@ boy as johnny cash and bol@@ ted the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in to the rocket .
it was one light at first .
d@@ s@@ r : boy , oh boy , oh boy ! and that &apos;s a straight line we got right over there . and i didn &apos;t even pro@@ mp@@ t him .
and these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube , we call it in holl@@ and .
you can see where the oil is concent@@ rated at the surface , and then it is attac@@ ked , because they don &apos;t want the evidence , in my op@@ ini@@ on .
it gives you great power@@ s .
they pack@@ age it with the red ri@@ bb@@ on that re@@ minds us of hiv , put it in boxes that re@@ mind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act p@@ ru@@ d@@ ently .
and with that ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
it &apos;s like this . you tri@@ g@@ ger the spot .
but in other cases , this could be 18 del@@ et@@ es and two keeps , and we would keep it , because if those last two keeps say , &quot; wait a minute , wait a minute .
al se@@ ck@@ el says our brains are mis@@ -@@ wi@@ red
which of those happened first ?
tumor tre@@ ating fields were invented by dr. yor@@ am pal@@ t@@ i , professor emer@@ it@@ us at the techni@@ on in israel .
well , in africa , we have the equi@@ valent of seven jum@@ b@@ o 7@@ 4@@ 7@@ s crash@@ ing every day .
you see them all the time , you think .
it was len@@ i rie@@ fen@@ sta@@ hl in her elegant na@@ z@@ i propa@@ ganda who gave context to what the family had to en@@ dur@@ e .
one is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sex@@ y .
i hope you invest@@ ed person@@ ally .
you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times , or have different parts of the hardware doing different things .
consciousness consi@@ sts of all those states of feeling or senti@@ ence or a@@ war@@ eness .
so let &apos;s show how we do that .
we &apos;re going to have to live closer to each other .
has been with me ever since i was a child .
fif@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old ta@@ v@@ i ge@@ vin@@ son had a hard time finding strong female , te@@ en@@ age role models -- so she built a space where they could find each other . at tedx@@ teen , she illu@@ str@@ ates how the conver@@ sa@@ tions on sites like ro@@ ok@@ ie , her wil@@ dly popular web magazine for and by teen girls , are putting a new , un@@ ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically un@@ certain and rich@@ ly complex face on modern fe@@ min@@ ism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i was worried about va@@ gin@@ as . i was worried what we think about va@@ gin@@ as , and even more worried that we don &apos;t think about them .
how many people times how much water .
now , you don &apos;t really think that our air@@ plane system depends on the internet , and in some sense it doesn &apos;t .
we know it &apos;s not anything that we &apos;ve seen before ; it &apos;s sort of the equi@@ valent of an un@@ char@@ ted continent right within our own genetic information .
but in the blind taste test , it came in last .
we couldn &apos;t have a ger@@ m theory of disease before we invented the micros@@ cope to see them .
i &apos;ve been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dol@@ ph@@ ins for the past 30 years .
walter mis@@ ch@@ el , my colleague at stanford , went back 14 years later , to try to dis@@ cover what was different about those kids .
but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go .
right now in liber@@ ia , what do you see as the main issue that trou@@ bles you ?
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance .
we need to learn how to repair and re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the earth &apos;s o@@ zone la@@ yer .
for each patient , we will be able to do up to 100 different viral lo@@ ads per patient .
ok , i &apos;ve been using laptops since their in@@ ception .
also some of the stuff we can do is , for these individual i@@ con@@ s we thought -- i mean , how can we play with the idea of an ic@@ on , and push that further ?
one of the things that happened with the two previ@@ ous oil sp@@ ills was that we really worked on some of the symp@@ tom@@ s .
so these out@@ fall pi@@ p@@ es have been re@@ tro@@ fit@@ ted to shu@@ t se@@ a@@ water off from enter@@ ing the system .
that &apos;s pretty ambigu@@ ous .
i &apos;ve taken one shot ; i cro@@ pped it a few different ways .
for me , i really love this idea .
so that &apos;s a sort of t@@ ough choice .
a fixed pol@@ ar@@ ity of power means fixed al@@ li@@ ances .
in the 198@@ 0s , this young doctor , tom fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was the medical edi@@ tor of the whole earth cat@@ alo@@ g .
well it allowed you to do that .
what are the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of this top qu@@ arti@@ le ?
and they &apos;re at the shar@@ p end of what &apos;s called the wee@@ e , which is this european electri@@ cal and electr@@ on@@ ic waste dire@@ ctive .
and they like to keep everything beauti@@ fully ra@@ ked . and they keep all the leaves away .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-@@ a@@ war@@ eness .
what india was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
so , if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes , remember this : that the light that falls on to your eye , sensor@@ y information , is mean@@ ing@@ less , because it could mean literally anything .
even now , our choices are having un@@ inten@@ ded effects .
after all , happiness is not just a privi@@ lege for the lucky few , but a fundamental human right for all .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the g@@ 8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possi@@ bilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
this is our landscape of food .
so you see the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers come out with a bit of sand , put it down , turn around , and go back in .
that gives you an idea of the different types of moti@@ va@@ tions and dedi@@ cation .
it really wasn &apos;t on the ra@@ dar screen .
five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds lie ou@@ tri@@ ght .
alex@@ a me@@ ade takes an innovative approach to art . not for her a life of sket@@ ching and stre@@ t@@ ching can@@ v@@ ases . instead , she sele@@ cts a topic and then pain@@ ts it-@@ -@@ literally . she cover@@ s everything in a scen@@ e-@@ -@@ people , cha@@ irs , food , you name it-@@ -@@ in a mas@@ k of paint that m@@ im@@ ics what &apos;s below it . in this eye@@ -@@ opening talk me@@ ade shows off photographs of some of the more out@@ land@@ ish results , and shares a new project invol@@ ving people , paint and milk .
k@@ eller rin@@ au@@ do : a min@@ i robot -- powered by your phone
so somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
i mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously , and i think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more .
but be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven com@@ posed music long after he lost his hearing .
so the students would take their mobile devices , take a picture , tri@@ ang@@ ulate the location , send that picture to fri@@ end@@ ly military un@@ its , who &apos;d come in and take out the s@@ ni@@ pers .
that de@@ vo@@ tion we feel for the national foot@@ ball team .
and there are obviously all kinds of things .
it comes from information that is fre@@ ely available and out there , but that we are will@@ fully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it pro@@ vo@@ kes .
americans spent , in 200@@ 1 -- 11 percent of all pe@@ sti@@ cide use was done on law@@ ns .
then the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends -- ar@@ ra@@ yed around the bri@@ de like planets around the sun .
many people were inspired by this .
so , i wanted to do something special today .
so you &apos;ve got food economy and local food at the top , you &apos;ve got greenhouse g@@ ases , solar and nuclear waste .
i &apos;ve become un@@ comfortable when i &apos;m separated from my laptop .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
so it &apos;s not his daughter , but it &apos;s somebody close to him , physi@@ cally close to him .
and finally , john bel@@ k said , &quot; do you know who &apos;s sitting here ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t always like her , but i did respect her , and she taught me a he@@ ck of a lot .
because , not only could people broad@@ cast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infin@@ ite amount of devices .
but it was left at that . no one seemed to be asking why .
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create pros@@ per@@ ity ?
these are sh@@ ots my wife took a couple days after the qu@@ a@@ ke , while i was making my way through the d.@@ r@@ . into the country .
one run on one of these machines : 200 gi@@ gab@@ ases in a week .
there are some ideas in computer science and in arti@@ ficial intelligence as to how this might be done , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior spr@@ ings from the physical interactions in living matter .
this is not a feeling .
these are children like umar .
the te@@ ct@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates of world politics were shifting .
i &apos;m going to read quickly -- and probably i &apos;m going to ed@@ it some , because i don &apos;t have that much time left -- a few of the colum@@ ns .
and , of course , watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful ri@@ vers , but for several other reasons as well .
in the age of glob@@ alization , we moved on .
so that &apos;s a very important piece of data .
so that was a sort of a success .
but even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : the expansion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down .
and it is 4@@ ,@@ 200 meters deep .
they &apos;d often send an eight year old boy all the way on this tru@@ dge to the market town to get that information and come back , then they &apos;d load the c@@ art .
where are all the little ones ? &quot;
all of that is over .
they think that if there &apos;s anything against them , then we are being an op@@ position newsp@@ aper .
if you &apos;d been a little more optimi@@ stic -- say , based upon the ro@@ aring t@@ wen@@ ties -- you &apos;d have said this .
too many po@@ gro@@ ms .
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mul@@ la@@ h mu@@ staf@@ a .
how do you test this ?
so let &apos;s play a 5@@ 50-@@ herz frequency and watch what happens .
i think people want to be allowed to be virtu@@ ous .
i mean , tiger surely was actually o@@ be@@ ying the ac@@ cent@@ ure model .
cha@@ z e@@ bert : it was cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attemp@@ ts to re@@ constru@@ ct my ja@@ w and re@@ store my ability to speak .
you see , there was a time when you weren &apos;t afraid of fail@@ ure , when you were a great artist or a great dan@@ cer and you could sing , you were good at math , you could build things , you were an astron@@ aut , an advent@@ ur@@ er , jac@@ qu@@ es cou@@ ste@@ au , you could jump higher , run faster , k@@ ick harder than anyone .
and they get me to that near@@ by hospital , ce@@ dar@@ s-@@ sin@@ ai , where that night i recei@@ ve , because of my inter@@ n@@ al ble@@ eding , 45 un@@ its of blood -- which means full re@@ plac@@ ements of all the blood in me -- before they &apos;re able to staun@@ ch the flow .
the in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary theory already has strong ob@@ serva@@ tional support .
but one of the great things about the search for massive pri@@ mes , it &apos;s not just finding the pri@@ mes .
you see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graph@@ s , their equ@@ ations , their fore@@ ca@@ sts , their prop@@ he@@ cies , and being ar@@ med with the questions to do that -- questions like : what are the assu@@ mp@@ tions that under@@ p@@ in this ?
not really , because if you looked at what happened in 199@@ 8 , the fire started .
so we might have -- for the first time in our species -- feeling ch@@ ases model , model ch@@ ases reality , reality &apos;s moving -- they might never cat@@ ch up .
e@@ ve ens@@ ler : embra@@ ce your inner girl
so none of this mis@@ he@@ gas of le@@ tting everybody go into whatever car they want .
and , as well , as of eff@@ ic@@ acy , agen@@ cy .
and car@@ l norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the for@@ mer camp .
each of these has a sens@@ or .
actually , one of cle@@ op@@ at@@ ra &apos;s guys .
it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt .
&quot; why ? &quot;
and look at this : they even teach their kids -- they train them in the same way the u.s. mar@@ ines train .
almost everything we do is sub@@ conscious .
it &apos;s out in the middle of the pac@@ i@@ fic , right around the equ@@ ator .
stir@@ red by the pros@@ pe@@ cts of mass communication and making big bucks on adver@@ tis@@ ing , david sar@@ no@@ ff commer@@ ci@@ ali@@ zes radio .
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d inv@@ ent a little game .
&quot; i write these stin@@ king lic@@ en@@ se , &quot; which i do .
this meant everything from perfe@@ cting the sa@@ w@@ n@@ -@@ off , sub-@@ two-@@ gra@@ m to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , to working with one of the world &apos;s leading nutri@@ tion@@ ists in developing a completely new , revolution@@ ary nutri@@ tional strategy from scratch : 6@@ ,000 cal@@ or@@ ies a day .
however , i felt like i had looked at enough photos of do@@ do sk@@ ul@@ ls to actually be able to understand the top@@ ology and perhaps repli@@ cate it -- i mean , it couldn &apos;t be that difficult .
and it turns out , dele@@ g@@ ation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything , apart from things like bo@@ di@@ ly fun@@ ctions , going to the toilet .
another big one , this is of course out of the hard@@ core desert area .
this is me . my name is ben sa@@ unders .
now that education you would recei@@ ve , and thanks to the british ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cian ad@@ ri@@ an james for those simul@@ ations . the signal was the same , the background noise was the same .
so if you look at cancers , it is very rare -- extremely rare -- to have cancer in a child , on the order of thousands of cases a year .
and fifth , the element of un@@ certain@@ ty .
that is what bio@@ energy is . it is not eth@@ an@@ ol . it is not subsi@@ dies to a few companies . it is not im@@ por@@ ting cor@@ n into i@@ o@@ wa because you &apos;ve built so many of these eth@@ an@@ ol plants . it is beginning to understand the transition that occur@@ red in agriculture , from br@@ ute force into biological force . and in the measure that you can do that , you can clean some stuff , and you can clean it pretty quickly .
a@@ hn tri@@ o : a modern take on pian@@ o , vi@@ oli@@ n , c@@ ello
that &apos;s a good audience , chris .
because when you think of how much data &apos;s coming into our brains , we &apos;re trying to take in as much data in a day as people used to take in in a lifetime .
and in fact , scientists were origin@@ ally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years , then they said 50 years .
and so , the games that i do , i think of really more as modern mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i to@@ ys .

so , i hope i &apos;ve got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .
c@@ ab@@ in@@ et minist@@ ers would ad@@ mit this .
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genom@@ es of living people and extinct humans .
however , they return to bas@@ el@@ ine a lot sooner .
sh@@ all we try that one again ?
but if compassion was fun , everybody &apos;s going to do it .
the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i &apos;d lost 10 years of my life .
here &apos;s a picture of the kids .
another technology that we see all around us out here is hy@@ bri@@ d cars .
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .
there &apos;s a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work , even after you have the fuel .
rather , africa was dr@@ ying out at that time .
and in south africa , we had taken our inno@@ v@@ ators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liber@@ ation from the dru@@ d@@ gery that people have .
there &apos;s a conver@@ gence . so , wherever the rain is fall@@ ing , the air is dra@@ wn towards it to re@@ place the air that &apos;s rising .
all of our pat@@ ents , our entire approach to pat@@ ents and invention , is based on the idea that the inv@@ ent@@ or knows what the invention is for ; we can say what it &apos;s for .
i was cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed , as if by a tr@@ ash comp@@ actor .
and what we don &apos;t often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these dis@@ pos@@ able products .
it &apos;s an accur@@ ate repres@@ entation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is oc@@ curr@@ ing inside you .
and what i &apos;m going to say to you now is i &apos;m just ur@@ ging you to get over this su@@ pre@@ me l@@ ack of self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , to take the pl@@ un@@ ge , to believe that you can trust your e@@ ars , you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue , fi@@ ber , dna , what makes a great piece of music great .
they could not , and they cannot , imagine how they could really deal with this reality .
so , looking wide , using your peri@@ pher@@ al vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity .
you just drive to the near@@ est lake , stick your h@@ ose in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
it led to the building on the left .
humanity is building a machine , and this en@@ ables us to collabor@@ ate in new ways .
but our genetic code still car@@ ries the sel@@ fish and aggressi@@ ve instin@@ cts that were of survival advan@@ tage in the past .

and watch that beginning to happen .
what we &apos;re saying here is the prob@@ ability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a const@@ ant , times the size of that attack , raised to the power of negative al@@ ph@@ a .
they are also organic com@@ pounds in which one or more of the hydro@@ gens in am@@ mon@@ ia is re@@ placed with a more complex group .

now by noise , i do not mean sound .

once several was@@ ps were all together in the same hi@@ ve , they had no choice but to cooper@@ ate , because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hi@@ ves .
it &apos;s trying to re@@ cover .
so it &apos;s -- for me , its been an extremely n@@ our@@ ishing sch@@ ol@@ arly advent@@ ure to look at the neuroscience that &apos;s associated with play , and to bring together people who in their individual discipl@@ ines hadn &apos;t really thought of it that way .
i &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a l@@ ack of it .
and i say back into the job market , because this is not new .
bf : thank you , that &apos;s it .
and the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being .
pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i , design cur@@ ator at new york &apos;s museum of modern art , wants to spread her appreci@@ ation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world .
let &apos;s go up and take a look at the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as .
first , we used a technique called dynamic time war@@ ping from speech recogni@@ tion , and this allows us to tempor@@ ally al@@ ign all of the examples , and then we apply kal@@ man fil@@ ter@@ ing , a technique from control theory , that allows us to stati@@ st@@ ically analy@@ ze all the noise and extra@@ ct the desi@@ red tra@@ je@@ ctory that under@@ lies them .
we can re@@ tool pris@@ ons so that hiv pre@@ vention and har@@ m redu@@ ction is available to pris@@ on@@ ers .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
interest@@ ingly enough , they also do this with ur@@ ani@@ um and chro@@ mi@@ um , and various other toxic metals .
in the majority of bub@@ ble univer@@ ses , the higgs mass could be around the critical value , near to a cos@@ mic collapse of the higgs field , because of two comp@@ eting effects , just as in the case of sand .
shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? why haven &apos;t you had it re@@ moved ? &quot;
and then that sig@@ nature is lost .
if hundreds of people didn &apos;t buy this , we couldn &apos;t put it on the market .
her story has a positive en@@ ding , but there are thousands of others in similar situ@@ ations who are much less fortun@@ ate .
conditions are very difficult , but we cannot afford to com@@ promise on those principles which made aims work .
in many ways , our au@@ d@@ acity to imagine helps push the boun@@ dar@@ ies of possibility .
but it is a problem .
we need to sa@@ vor smaller por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
we find it in every population around the world at all time peri@@ ods going back tens of thousands of years .
you know , this is a building designed like a d@@ v@@ d player .
and bon@@ nie said to the doctor , &quot; i &apos;m not worried about her not brea@@ thing .
when somebody shows up , and the hospital doesn &apos;t know what to do because they can &apos;t diagnose it , they call us .
i &apos;d like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my &quot; grand uni@@ fied theory of predi@@ cting the future , &quot; but it &apos;s closer to a peti@@ te uni@@ fied theory of predi@@ cting the future .
there was a war going on , as you know .
what a bur@@ den we have . &quot; i would like to ask you to re@@ frame that . how many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best eff@@ or@@ ts ?
do you remember , i gave you those fil@@ ters at the beginning .
we heard the most comp@@ elling call ever to have a conversation in this country , and i think globally , around race , right ?
but at the same time , there &apos;s some stuff that &apos;s just straight up twi@@ sted , and we really need to begin to challenge , look at it and really get in the process of de@@ con@@ struc@@ ting , re@@ defin@@ ing , what we come to know as man@@ hood .
but the pain , the dis@@ comfort , you know , paying attention , remember@@ ing to put it in your pur@@ se these are the da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day of life , and they do pose problems .
a vo@@ o@@ do@@ o experiment .
the way we test dylan is by giving it in@@ puts , as i said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in project prak@@ ash would get .

because there are two dist@@ in@@ ct aspects of democracy : there &apos;s ele@@ ct@@ or@@ al competition , which determin@@ es how you acqui@@ re power , and there are che@@ cks and bal@@ ances , which deter@@ mine how you use power .
so having the notes is a part of my thinking process , and i dis@@ cover what i &apos;m seeing as i &apos;m writing .
now , the com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world .
so , last month , the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pa@@ e@@ dia britan@@ ni@@ ca an@@ no@@ un@@ ced that it is going out of print after 24@@ 4 years , which made me no@@ stal@@ gic , because i remember playing a game with the col@@ os@@ sal en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia set in my hom@@ et@@ own library back when i was a kid , maybe 12 years old .
just as the morph@@ ology and the complexity of life on earth is never en@@ ding , little em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments and comple@@ xi@@ fi@@ cations in the dna code lead to new things like gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es , or or@@ chi@@ ds -- so too , do little em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments in the cro@@ ch@@ et code lead to new and won@@ dr@@ ous creatures in the evolutionary tree of cro@@ ch@@ et life .
rb : i also believe that being a father &apos;s incredibly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , i go on ho@@ li@@ day with them .
so i decided to get engaged , and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were .
and these are being au@@ g@@ mented even by our devices again today .
these are , of course , not the only in@@ si@@ ghts i could share , but i hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop ko@@ w@@ to@@ wing to them , why we need to re@@ bel and why we need to switch our independent decisi@@ on-@@ making cap@@ abilities on .
we camp@@ ed over@@ night in the trees , in tree bo@@ ats .
but this is basically the ex@@ tent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line .
now , the test of any idea -- i said it was a liter@@ ary con@@ c@@ eit -- is what does it get us ?
these gener@@ ative algorith@@ ms grow over time , and they interact and communicate as a s@@ war@@ m of insects .
so the stadium has a few elements which create that out@@ door comfort . first of all , it &apos;s sha@@ ding . it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and war@@ m wind .
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensi@@ ble reform possible until we end this corruption .
people going , &quot; a@@ wes@@ ome whe@@ els , du@@ de ! those are a@@ wes@@ ome !
but we &apos;re going through the ha@@ yst@@ ack no longer with a te@@ as@@ po@@ on but with a sk@@ i@@ p lo@@ a@@ der , because of this increase in speed .
so if we &apos;re going to study viral ch@@ at@@ ter , we need to get to these popul@@ ations who have inten@@ sive contact with wild animals .
so , by way of introdu@@ ction , that is the ex@@ act same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years .
there are little machines doing things in experiment@@ al bas@@ es .
thank you .
it occu@@ pi@@ ed the area of appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely one million square kilome@@ ters , cover@@ ing what is now pakistan , nor@@ th@@ western india and parts of afghanistan and iran .
but it might be .
they don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
for example , a friend of mine .
take climate change . is it not absolutely sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poor@@ est countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
i did what most of us do -- i tried it on some colleagues .
and one of the things about the search for massive pri@@ mes that i love so much is some of the great mathema@@ tical minds of all time have gone on this search .
what &apos;s the process of telling a story ?
nan@@ otech@@ n@@ ology : this is a small generator .
if you have a princi@@ ple such as , people shouldn &apos;t suffer unless they &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something , then to ex@@ clu@@ de black people you &apos;ve got to make excep@@ tions , don &apos;t you ?
just before the cur@@ tain went up , i had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. don@@ al@@ d@@ son what we were gon@@ na do , and i said , &quot; the tel@@ e-@@ actor is going to be jo@@ ining you on stage , and this is a new experiment@@ al project , and people are watching her on their scre@@ ens , and she &apos;s got -- there &apos;s cameras involved and there &apos;s micro@@ phones and she &apos;s got an ear@@ bu@@ d in her e@@ ar , and people over the network are giving her ad@@ vice about what to do next . &quot;
so he tried to change the rules for pri@@ cing on electricity , but ran into a fire@@ stor@@ m of pro@@ test from businesses and con@@ sumers who wanted to preser@@ ve the exist@@ ing subsi@@ di@@ zed rates .
and their mission was to find and to destro@@ y -- remember the sc@@ u@@ d mis@@ si@@ le laun@@ chers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the ira@@ q@@ is were laun@@ ching at the israeli@@ s ?
so this is a beautiful image of a visual inter@@ neuron from a mouse that came from jeff licht@@ man &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
we will be able to fly into the an@@ atom@@ y of peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more import@@ antly , we can look into his mind .
but how could the crow@@ d become synchron@@ ized ?
show everybody what you in@@ tend . &quot;
and so we talked about these special words that we teach them .
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with minist@@ ers of education , holding these press con@@ ferences , which of course , now were lo@@ ad@@ ed with press , everybody was there .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
you know that would re@@ frame civilization itself -- -- and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succe@@ e@@ ds us : the sustainable species , living on a fin@@ ite earth , eth@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ ologi@@ cally in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations -- that is to say , into the in@@ defin@@ ite future .
i hope nobody fin@@ ds that offen@@ sive .
i have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lif@@ ted and transpor@@ ted in moments of p@@ ure joy .
what has ap@@ pa@@ ch@@ an done ? ap@@ pa@@ ch@@ an , unfortunately , is no more , but he has left behind a message .
then a man named je@@ an-@@ paul sar@@ tr@@ e wrote a book ti@@ tled &quot; being and no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness . &quot;
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
the best bat@@ ters fa@@ il seven out of 10 times .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phr@@ ase : &quot; real world geom@@ etry . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you the results of a very lar@@ ge-@@ scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like , using , essentially , some of the play principles and some of the design principles that , you know , humans have labor@@ ed so hard to pick up , but appar@@ ently nature knew how to do at the beginning .
so , they rely on co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a in terms of its marketing , and what &apos;s the secret to their marketing ?
we know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-@@ carbon economy in record time .
consider : if you needed surgery , you would want the best possible technical surgeon , right ?
if we put al@@ umin@@ um windows in this house , we would double the energy use right there .
and then the important third dimension .
smaller objects have smaller schwar@@ z@@ schil@@ d radi@@ i .
judge for@@ er did what she was required to do , and then she qu@@ it the ben@@ ch .
it &apos;s clear to me . &quot;
what i &apos;m going to do , in the spirit of collabor@@ ative creativity , is simply repe@@ at many of the points that the three people before me have already made , but do them -- this is called &quot; creative collaboration ; &quot; it &apos;s actually called &quot; bor@@ ro@@ wing &quot; -- but do it through a particular perspective , and that is to ask about the role of us@@ ers and con@@ sumers in this emerging world of collabor@@ ative creativity that j@@ im@@ my and others have talked about .
he then goes to rwand@@ a and to con@@ go in the after@@ math of the genocide , and he &apos;s the guy who has to decide -- huh , ok , the genocide is over ; 8@@ 00,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fle@@ eing into neigh@@ bor@@ ing countries -- into con@@ go , into tanz@@ ania .
so soldier was fle@@ eing in the o@@ kap@@ i fa@@ un@@ al reser@@ ve .
we &apos;re all hiv-@@ positive .
but in the last year , paul cru@@ tzen published this es@@ say saying roughly what &apos;s all been said before : that maybe , given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the un@@ certain imp@@ acts , we should think about things like this .
things like cu@@ dd@@ ling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
i think , of the people that build all this technology in the network , a lot of them aren &apos;t very good at conne@@ cting with people .
the kit@@ chen is 25 grand a month . okay ?
they did it with pu@@ pp@@ ies .
when you have trees , the root system holds the water .
they can only win if they all pull together as a team .
patient : two .
so what happened ?
this is what &apos;s called a hydro@@ ther@@ mal vent .
now we know that he &apos;s a con@@ vi@@ cted wi@@ fe@@ -@@ bat@@ ter@@ er , and actually he &apos;s not the good guy .
yeah , interesting , but a little dangerous .
we find that pre@@ mis@@ e quite exciting .
gi@@ v@@ ein@@ dia is for a whole country .
so for me , the sub@@ stance of things un@@ seen is how reality tv is driving reality .
you don &apos;t like to be surprised by people who come around the corner .
what &apos;s green carbon ?
he gave the popular lec@@ tures that became &quot; the character of physical law . &quot;
enjoy , and thank you very much .
and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light ac@@ tiv@@ ator chan@@ nel@@ rho@@ dop@@ s@@ in .
that if you are a lea@@ der in any area -- in business , in politics , in spor@@ ts , in art , in acade@@ mi@@ cs , in any area -- you don &apos;t own it ; you are a ste@@ ward of it .
so , it &apos;s an open loo@@ p control .
and that put me in touch with such diver@@ se design examples as the aer@@ o@@ gel@@ s from the la@@ wr@@ ence li@@ ver@@ more lab in california ; at that time , they were beginning to be brought into the civili@@ an market .
to us , when we look at a red@@ wood tree , it seems to be mo@@ tion@@ less and still , and yet red@@ woo@@ ds are constantly in motion , moving up@@ ward into space , artic@@ ul@@ ating themselves and fil@@ ling red@@ wood space over red@@ wood time , over thousands of years .
this was actually the experiment . so you can see the co@@ ils were some@@ what larger .
that &apos;s what the future has got to be , and putting it in the public domain is smart .
so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
she lived to a hundred , even then . all along it was the sa@@ dness , the squ@@ al@@ or , but i never , until now loved her again .
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
i &apos;m going to talk about a technology that we &apos;re developing at oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and holly@@ wood movies are being made .
and , mostly because people never really ask you , and when they do , you don &apos;t really think they want to know the truth .
that their parents be less ti@@ red and less stres@@ sed .
the ch@@ ie@@ f policy man took this idea to cap@@ it@@ ol h@@ ill , and as he repor@@ ted back to me , the response was , &quot; hell no !
there was one country , though , which was able to escap@@ e or stay away from that vi@@ cious cycle .
in school , i studied nothing close to design or engineering ; i studied us@@ eless things like the clas@@ si@@ cs , but there were some lessons even there -- this guy , pla@@ to , it turns out he &apos;s a designer .
i think everybody should do it -- think that you &apos;ve got three wi@@ shes .
for this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
it was only after mr. tesz@@ ler &apos;s death that i learned that the mar@@ ker on the grave of bel@@ a bar@@ to@@ k in har@@ ts@@ d@@ ale , new york was paid for by sand@@ or tesz@@ ler . &quot; yo n@@ ap@@ ot , bel@@ a ! &quot;
and by the way , our to@@ wns and cities are where they are , and grew where they were because they occup@@ y all the important sites .
your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
they com@@ mit to the cause . they com@@ mit to the tribe .
i just really want to thank you very much .
and i said , &quot; so why don &apos;t you just stim@@ ulate the cli@@ tor@@ is of the pig ?
there are now 4@@ 00,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their wo@@ unds .
this was eight years ago , some people were more republi@@ can back then .
we can &apos;t help but stop , right ? this feeling &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it &apos;s made of sil@@ con@@ -@@ co@@ ated glass fi@@ ber .
previ@@ ous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiment at all .
but that &apos;s obviously ir@@ re@@ versi@@ ble , and there could be side effects .
the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done , scan@@ ning it and saying &quot; u@@ h huh , &quot; that seems to be quite suff@@ i@@ cient to dra@@ matically improve people &apos;s moti@@ va@@ tions .
and the idea is can we do the same for this ?
ty@@ ler mac@@ cre@@ ady : you can ch@@ ase it , like this , for hours .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
and when the bronx bor@@ ough president shows up and the state sen@@ ator comes to our class , believe you me , the bronx can change at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des now .
there was a traffic ja@@ m and a crow@@ d of people gather@@ ed as if it were the location of some spectacular acci@@ dent , or the sudden si@@ ghting of a vis@@ iting pop star .
now something &apos;s interesting here . this looks very different than any sand on earth that i &apos;ve ever seen , and i &apos;ve seen a lot of sand on earth , believe me .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve con@@ fin@@ ed that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
many years ago i heard a mathema@@ tician from vi@@ en@@ na , whose name was mar@@ ch@@ ett@@ i , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civili@@ an society are two sin@@ us@@ o@@ i@@ ds that are kind of opposed .
i &apos;d like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our ra@@ dar -- and i &apos;ll use this l@@ ens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the she@@ er good lu@@ ck of avo@@ i@@ ding in@@ definitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
but then , of course , the body has many parts , and things grow at different rates , and they have different si@@ zes and different people ; however , not so with the inter@@ ior .
yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dig@@ nity and making the world a fair@@ er place .
and in a way , the video games , the f@@ on@@ ts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design .
and we never hear about that . and the lat@@ est infra@@ ction against these people is , as part of plan col@@ om@@ bia , we &apos;re spra@@ ying para@@ qu@@ at or ro@@ und up , whatever it is -- we &apos;re de@@ fo@@ li@@ ating thousands of acr@@ es of the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an amazon in our war on drugs .
but why is it important to attra@@ ct those who believe what you believe ?
because we understand very little about most human diseases .
fre@@ est@@ yle ori@@ ented , man@@ ual down -- wheel@@ ie down .
we &apos;ve never had such gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an sur@@ pl@@ uses before .
we did not know about sky@@ writer -- all these different programs run by u.s. intelligence agen@@ cies .
why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
again , not a single one of them -- i think there are about seven or eight of them -- thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
they had bad burn rate in the gold rush . a very bad burn rate .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
but when they get hy@@ dr@@ ated and they bon@@ d to each other , they create a stronger molecule , a stronger protein we call gl@@ uten .
but one of the things that really wor@@ ries me is : where &apos;s the younger version of those kids going today ?
so , i began to do a research project of my own .
and so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
jar@@ re@@ th mer@@ z , a s@@ wis@@ s-@@ ghan@@ ai@@ an film@@ ma@@ ker , came to ghana in 2008 to film the national elections . what he saw there taught him new lessons about democracy -- and about himself .
and great art would have &quot; head &quot; : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and con@@ cep@@ ts .
the mechanism of heli@@ cop@@ ters se@@ ats and windows was used , by the way , as well as a d@@ ash@@ board that was inspired by two-@@ wheel@@ ers .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s teach him to sit . &quot;
and that was a personal belief , regar@@ d@@ less of what &apos;s going on , regar@@ d@@ less of the details .
this takes the temperature of the can@@ al and turns it into this four@@ -@@ degrees of heat exchange .
well it seems to me that we &apos;re now seeing a fundamental shift of power , broad@@ ly speaking , away from nations gather@@ ed around the atlan@@ tic &#91; se@@ abo@@ ard &#93; to the nations gather@@ ed around the pac@@ i@@ fic ri@@ m .
9@@ 8@@ 7 squ@@ ared is 9@@ 7@@ 4@@ ,@@ 16@@ 9 .
and as you think of the imp@@ lications of that , here &apos;s a brief history of the universe .
because out of the urban de@@ va@@ station in port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ prin@@ ce came a tor@@ r@@ ent of s@@ ms tex@@ ts -- people cr@@ ying for help , bes@@ e@@ ech@@ ing us for as@@ si@@ stance , sharing data , off@@ ering support , looking for their loved ones .
how often do you get to partici@@ pate in a big scientific project ?
dr. a@@ dam nei@@ man .
conserva@@ tives have more of a five-@@ foundation , or five-@@ chan@@ nel morality .
and certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embra@@ ce and be grat@@ eful for .
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
why do we want to be involved ?
now , there &apos;s kind of two issues here .
i think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but i think leaving it to ph@@ d can@@ di@@ dat@@ es is far too few people , and way too late in life .
i worked for the co@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a u.@@ n. good@@ will am@@ bas@@ sad@@ or .
showing spectacular clips from produ@@ ctions such as fri@@ da , the tempest and the li@@ on king , director jul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor descri@@ bes a life spent immer@@ sed in theater and the movies . fil@@ med right as contro@@ ver@@ sy over her broad@@ way production of spider@@ - turn off the dark was at its pe@@ ak , she can@@ di@@ dly descri@@ bes the ten@@ sions inher@@ ent within her creative process , as she stri@@ ves both to capture the essen@@ ce of a stor@@ y-@@ -@@ and produce images and experi@@ ences unlike anything else .
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cle@@ an@@ up operation on mt . ever@@ est .
and then there &apos;s a co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in along the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , where tel avi@@ v is now .
a bit of cl@@ oning , you can get them back .
charles li@@ mb : this is a plastic mi@@ di pian@@ o keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .
and i talked about this throughout the entire campa@@ ign .
we got it just done in time to show you , so it &apos;s kind of the world de@@ but of our digital ima@@ ging center .
what lies within us can never be truly colon@@ ized , con@@ tor@@ ted , or taken away .
and then it was onto the sau@@ cer .
thank you .
in an age of global stri@@ fe and climate change , i &apos;m here to answer the all important question : why is sex so dam@@ n good ?
and that &apos;s complexity .
we also had to create an artic@@ ul@@ ating ton@@ gue that allowed him to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate his words .
i don &apos;t know for sure , but i think at this point it &apos;s sort of almost em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing not to at least try .
so this is how it &apos;s passed from mother to son .
but deeply tu@@ cked into the fabri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimen@@ sions , as we see there .
they will do it themselves .
what if we could bring all the instru@@ ments in together in one place ?
mt : i like to think of myself as an honest magi@@ cian .
mar@@ co tempest : now tes@@ la &apos;s brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
as i was approach@@ ing my late 4@@ 0s , when i would wake up in the morning my first six thou@@ ghts would all be negative .
i am an emo@@ tional creature .
i said , &quot; i have never seen it .
but basically , you &apos;ve got to get out of town as quickly as possible .
they &apos;re all over the glo@@ be , but virtually all of them live in tropic@@ al ra@@ infor@@ est@@ s .
the bu@@ mp@@ er of the car hit my thro@@ at , sli@@ cing it open .
most of american electricity comes from burning fossil fu@@ els .
so if you have a contain@@ er , it &apos;s like getting in your car .
this lets you do it .
good morning . i think , as a gr@@ ump@@ y eastern european , i was brought in to play the pessi@@ mist this morning . so bear with me .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all i &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . well , that &apos;s easy .
and a lot of nation@@ al@@ ism came in .
even the most pessi@@ mi@@ stic impact scen@@ ari@@ os of the u.@@ n .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s some sch@@ aden@@ freude there , that we actually take de@@ light in people getting things wrong , so that we can then mo@@ an and gro@@ an and bit@@ ch at them .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but i have to work within that domain , to en@@ sure that it gets you there first .
oh , i missed one : or e ) none of the above ?
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
what i &apos;m hop@@ ing is that they might just dri@@ ft apart because their frequ@@ en@@ cies aren &apos;t perfectly the same .
now , that is difficult .
there &apos;s also a weather go@@ dd@@ ess who contro@@ ls a random stock market and random weather .
i thought , dam@@ n , those are going to be some big pants !
or another example would be , if you &apos;re a phone company , you figure out who &apos;s central in the network and you ask those people , &quot; look , will you just text us your fe@@ ver every day ?
and when you &apos;re out@@ doors , that type of air has micro@@ bes that are common@@ ly associated with plant leaves and with dir@@ t .
yeah .
you need an au@@ v , an auton@@ om@@ ous underwater vehicle .
when we don &apos;t have the capacity for soli@@ tude , we turn to other people in order to feel less anxi@@ ous or in order to feel alive .
you go places you &apos;ve dre@@ am@@ t about .
but , you know , as i looked at this more and more and more , and saw these images go across the rocks , i realized i was seeing the same arch@@ et@@ yp@@ al events de@@ pic@@ ted again and again and again .
thank you .
but in the mean@@ time , these things are sc@@ aling up .
we have some pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary evidence from bar@@ ga@@ ining that early war@@ ning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad dis@@ agre@@ ement that costs money , and chim@@ ps are better competi@@ tors than humans , as jud@@ ged by game theory .
humans ran and ran all the time .
it &apos;s a cat@@ astrop@@ he .
priv@@ acy is the building block of our democra@@ cies .
fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face communication has been fin@@ e-@@ tuned by millions of years of evolution .
so the difference is , is that rather than lin@@ king from page to page , we &apos;re actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea , rather than to the other page .
he was very popular .
after all , for all its gri@@ m , sat@@ an@@ ic m@@ ills , it worked out pretty well , didn &apos;t it ?
and i think if we can just ad@@ mit that we &apos;re all trying to appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te the truth of our own communities , it will make for a much more nu@@ an@@ ced and a much more interesting conversation .
and then the second question was , &quot; do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue ? &quot;
they travel@@ ed all around europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .
so we said , &quot; let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
tra@@ iler number two , you have a b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late , you can to anything you want .
and i stood on that stage with di@@ zzy g@@ ill@@ es@@ p@@ ie on sound check on a we@@ dn@@ es@@ day after@@ no@@ on , and i said , &quot; di@@ zzy , why would you come to a black@@ -@@ run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn &apos;t even have a reputation in music ? &quot;
and in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste su@@ gar stream from a food process@@ ing plant .
and more important , he will let them all re@@ cover the go@@ ds , the stat@@ ues , the temp@@ le v@@ es@@ sel@@ s that had been con@@ fis@@ cated .
now realize that in a recently infe@@ cted person , there are millions of these ships ; each one is just slightly different .
and it &apos;s an attra@@ ctive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
now also being engineering scientists , we were able to quanti@@ fy the performance benefits of the lever@@ a@@ ged freedom chair , so here are some sh@@ ots of our tri@@ al in gu@@ atem@@ ala where we tested the lfc on village ter@@ rain , and tested people &apos;s biom@@ e@@ chan@@ ical out@@ puts , their oxygen consumption , how fast they go , how much power they &apos;re putting out , both in their regular wheel@@ cha@@ irs and using the lfc , and we found that the lfc is about 80 percent faster going on these ter@@ ra@@ ins than a normal wheelchair .
well , that &apos;s one reason we had a conference here at us@@ c a few years ago .
i work a lot . i mean , a lot .
we think that this these &quot; why &quot; questions can give us clu@@ es about the fundamental principles of nature .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they stri@@ ke this funny little position that says , &quot; i &apos;m not threat@@ ening , but i need a mas@@ sage . &quot;
i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies .
is it okay to mani@@ pul@@ ate and create whatever creatures we want ?
in part , we have the leg@@ acy of freu@@ d , who was a pessi@@ mist , who said that pur@@ suit of happiness is a do@@ om@@ ed quest , is prop@@ elled by in@@ fan@@ tile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very ti@@ ght design loo@@ p with the teachers themselves .
in the middle , our experiment@@ alist , the neurolog@@ ist , who said , &quot; i &apos;m going to move this down a little and i &apos;m going to er@@ ase half your au@@ ra . &quot;
r@@ s@@ w : no . what did he say ?
the te@@ en@@ age king of b@@ hu@@ tan was also a curious man , but this was back in 197@@ 2 , when he as@@ cen@@ ded to the thr@@ one two days after his father passed away .
it turned out to be absolutely instru@@ mental many decades later in pro@@ ving fer@@ m@@ at &apos;s last theor@@ em .
so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fi@@ x up these o@@ ars so that i could carry on .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
i was a gu@@ est student during one month of a public health course .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
lar@@ ry brilliant : first of all , you &apos;re not ma@@ d about the copy@@ right viol@@ ation ?
so , one needs a very deep appreci@@ ation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in prepar@@ ing to make contact with life el@@ sewhere in the cos@@ mo@@ s .
but electricity is also very , very bro@@ ad , so you have to sort of nar@@ row it down .
i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail .
and she died qui@@ et@@ ly in her favorite place .
i &apos;m not the only kid who grew up this way , surrounded by people who used to say that rhy@@ me about sti@@ cks and st@@ ones , as if broken b@@ ones hurt more than the nam@@ es we got called , and we got called them all .
and conservation international had struck some of those de@@ als .
same language , ti@@ mel@@ ine , et ce@@ ter@@ a . makes sense .
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in han@@ o@@ i , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in beijing .
and you probably feel them if you grab@@ bed it .
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it cre@@ ep@@ ing up , and they own that as it goes along .
patients become depres@@ sed .
so there &apos;s a titanic amount of data out there now , un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented .
with load bal@@ an@@ cing , this can be possible .
the trick@@ ster has a mind that is prepar@@ ed for the un@@ prepar@@ ed .
so in or@@ tho@@ dox je@@ wish communities , every fri@@ day you go to a mi@@ k@@ ve@@ h .
so the relative change that et , edu@@ ca@@ tional technology , would make , would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top , but we seem to be doing it the other way about .
they wanted to be foot@@ ball@@ ers before .
this is the silk that &apos;s used to make the frame and radi@@ i of an or@@ b web , and also the safety tra@@ iling dra@@ gl@@ ine .
but the last two needs -- the first four needs are called the needs of the person@@ alities , is what i call it -- the last two are the needs of the spirit .
but i was en@@ rap@@ tured , and in my graduate years was the da@@ wn of plate te@@ ct@@ on@@ ics . and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lies ben@@ e@@ ath the sea .
many of you could ask the question , you know , why is a flying car , or maybe more accur@@ ately , a ro@@ ad@@ able air@@ cra@@ ft , possible at this time ?
and then after that , you suc@@ cum@@ b to the ri@@ g@@ ors of time .
now , fortunately , technology has come a long way , and we can now grade a range of interesting types of hom@@ e@@ work .
chris ab@@ an@@ i : on humanity
we cannot afford to take that chance .
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot;
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
and i think one of the problems of a re@@ cession is that people become more prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ist , they look in on themselves , they try to protect their own nation , perhaps at the expen@@ se of other nations .
the more optimi@@ stic you were , the less likely this region was to respon@@ d to unexpected negative information .
and the cause of death is the broken ne@@ ck .
that &apos;s an order of ma@@ gni@@ tude , up or down .
and if you do it right , people will actually embra@@ ce the change , and if you do it right , people will actually even like it .
wi@@ red almost never puts women on its cover .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look sil@@ ly ?
okay . now i said -- when i was in den@@ mark , my h@@ ost was named anne mar@@ ie .
and ever since then , i &apos;ve gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys .
a ser@@ vant , a lovely ser@@ vant .
basically , i use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash .
and what we wanted to get was the ir@@ on .
in 200@@ 6 , the head of the american mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge ban@@ kers associ@@ ation said , quote , &quot; as we can clearly see , no sei@@ s@@ mic oc@@ curr@@ ence is about to over@@ whel@@ m the u.s. economy . &quot;
and yet , i had an un@@ usual position toward this .
so even though i have a fear of hei@@ ghts , i recently str@@ apped myself to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an air@@ plane at 12@@ ,000 ft .
yet still , many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and se@@ ek out even more of them .
it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world .
so , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .
nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ?
you see people who are really sh@@ ell@@ -@@ sho@@ cked .
and you can actually get opti@@ mal nutri@@ tional yi@@ el@@ d by running a kind of high-@@ quality li@@ qu@@ id soil over plants &apos; root systems .
our children are becoming depres@@ sed at an al@@ ar@@ ming rate .
but the third class of re@@ forms is that we &apos;ve got to change the nature of social relationships in congress .
eventually , the government listen@@ ed and , amaz@@ ingly , they changed their laws .
on one of them , car@@ ve : &quot; problems are solu@@ ble . &quot;
this is a really good example of that .
so , i do something now i &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; sho@@ ot , ever .
thank you .
thanks , rom . thanks a lot .
they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it .
jur@@ as@@ sic park still shi@@ mm@@ ers in part of ma@@ da@@ g@@ as@@ car , and the center of bra@@ zi@@ l , where plants called &quot; cy@@ ca@@ ds &quot; remain rock hard .
right ?
and this sequence shows the buil@@ du@@ p of that model .
new pre@@ dat@@ ors , hy@@ en@@ as , getting faster and faster still .
it also makes sense in very strong markets .
but the thing that struck me is , one guy said in ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation , a very famous neuro@@ biolog@@ ist , he said , &quot; look , in my discipline it &apos;s okay to be interested in consciousness , but get ten@@ ure first . get ten@@ ure first . &quot;
but basically it &apos;s when there is no@@ vel@@ ty .
modern agriculture depends on phosph@@ or@@ us .
and we &apos;re going to cru@@ ise down and take a look at banglades@@ h and see what the impact will be of t@@ win increases in water coming from the north , and in the se@@ as rising from the south .
that &apos;s why we know their nam@@ es .
and due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are recei@@ ving the life@@ -@@ saving drugs that they need .
they are moving to cities , where they also get better as@@ si@@ stance for that .
this t@@ one used to mean bad news .
what &apos;s amazing about this is , if the pro@@ c@@ essi@@ onal of the we@@ d@@ ding was this much fun , can you imagine how much fun the re@@ ception must have been ?
and i say that because the system in tur@@ key is not@@ able .
right now i should say , there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-@@ home internet connection .
you can let the fly play a little video game by le@@ tting it fly around in a visual dis@@ play .
so , in a sense , we often talk about the value of prote@@ cting intellectual property , you know , building bar@@ ri@@ ca@@ des , having secre@@ tive r &amp; amp ; d lab@@ s , pat@@ enting everything that we have , so that those ideas will remain valu@@ able , and people will be incenti@@ vi@@ zed to come up with more ideas , and the culture will be more innovative .
it never makes a mistake . because if you make a mistake , you don &apos;t leave any pro@@ gen@@ y .
since then , we &apos;ve dou@@ bled the number of ro@@ ads in america , and we now spend one fifth of our income on transpor@@ tation .
go back@@ wards .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up guns .
and i was like , &quot; yeah , ray .
so i want to ask a question : what should culture in the 21st century look like ?
so there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
so ra@@ in@@ fall cycle and water reg@@ ulation by ra@@ infor@@ est@@ s at an ecosystem level .
right , i &apos;m an on@@ c@@ olog@@ ist and i have to say most of what we give is actually poison .
which was very contro@@ versi@@ al , but it reson@@ ated with a lot of people .
it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago .
and if you ever get bor@@ ed you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
many of our fol@@ k to@@ ys have great science principles .
here is the situation : countries are turning in@@ wards .
so in the spirit of ted they &apos;re doing things together because it makes a difference .
and there are only two vehicles in india -- one real , one scri@@ p@@ ted .
and what he did was he wrote down on the board &quot; $ 8@@ 5,000 , &quot; and he said , &quot; that &apos;s her sal@@ ary , &quot; and then he wrote down &quot; $ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
every time we lead one of these eff@@ or@@ ts we have to whi@@ p ourselves into this imm@@ in@@ ent threat thing .
it &apos;s made to feel , by maga@@ zin@@ es and other media out@@ lets , that if you &apos;ve got energy , a few bright ideas about technology , a gar@@ age , you too could start a major thing .
and they published this book in 193@@ 7 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole organs ?
you &apos;re , well , you &apos;re general po@@ well . &quot;
and sometimes it gets big enough to become offi@@ cial .
r@@ w : ... sort of had a f@@ ame . his f@@ ame was built on that in l@@ .a. for a while .
when he started a sentence , particularly in the early parts of the interview , and p@@ aus@@ ed , you gave him the word , the bridge to get to the end of the sentence , and by the end of it , he was speaking complete sent@@ ences on his own . &quot;
they not only motiv@@ ate you to be@@ have in certain ways , but they change the way you think .
it &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full width and wonder of the world .
they disappeared .
these are a species that we need to join with .
how do we know that being in a space makes a difference ?
but , bes@@ i@@ des being a black woman , i am different from most of you in some other ways .
i &apos;m going to do some surgery here .
they &apos;re unique fac@@ ets of the human imagination .
and it was with great de@@ light that we found young people up and down the country expla@@ ining with authority what fi@@ li@@ bu@@ ster@@ ing was and why the l@@ or@@ ds might de@@ fy their bed@@ time on a point of princi@@ ple .
so , he played in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , straight after the game , went from the stadium to hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , sat in a priv@@ ate cor@@ por@@ ate je@@ t -- first re@@ fu@@ eling in por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ eling in bra@@ zi@@ l ; he was in west in@@ dies in time .
and of course , there &apos;s hope . one is this amazing human brain .
ok ? and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone .
so that &apos;s one point for insects .
and the thing is , if they &apos;re not har@@ m@@ ful , they &apos;re not to be completely dis@@ missed .
now i would argu@@ e , actually , if you look at the fact that on the highways today , you &apos;re only aver@@ a@@ ging about 30 miles per hour -- on average , according to the do@@ t -- the sky@@ car tra@@ vels at over 300 miles an hour , up to 2@@ 5,000 feet .
she typ@@ ically bu@@ ys a cow . the cow gives milk .
some of this stuff is hard .
and here i want to re@@ mind you of a wonderful point that paul mac@@ cre@@ ady made at ted three years ago .
but if your fuel source is free , then the only thing that matters is the up@@ -@@ front capital cost of the engine .
and occas@@ ion@@ ally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fa@@ ils of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
i &apos;m going to show you a brief time lap@@ se .
come on . we want everyone down there .
but there &apos;s much more push from the ground than you &apos;d think , if we got organi@@ zed .
but of course it &apos;s not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy .
what they had was dop@@ a-@@ responsive dy@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
we ne@@ arly went extinct . we were hanging on by our fing@@ er@@ na@@ ils .
it &apos;s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before .
and the most impres@@ sive outcomes of worl@@ d-@@ class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system .
i &apos;m supposed to be up here telling you the good news .
and this ch@@ art goes back to 1@@ 500 .
so if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infin@@ itely big universe , with r@@ and@@ om@@ ly bu@@ mp@@ ing into each other particles , there will occas@@ ion@@ ally be small flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations in the lower entrop@@ y states , and then they rela@@ x back .
there &apos;s self-@@ accep@@ tan@@ ce , there &apos;s family accep@@ tan@@ ce , and there &apos;s social accep@@ tan@@ ce .
leaving something in@@ complete makes it interesting , and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth . &quot; thank you .
i like to think of this as the at@@ ar@@ i p@@ ong of this bl@@ en@@ de@@ d-@@ reality play .
scre@@ w you . go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well .
accep@@ ting his 2007 prize , war photographer james nacht@@ we@@ y shows his life &apos;s work and as@@ ks ted to help him continue telling the story with innovative , exciting uses of news photograph@@ y in the digital era .
because it &apos;s not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
so , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
so you &apos;ve got this highly sty@@ li@@ zed portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star .
now the mechanism , as i said , for doing this , is you need to take out anybody poin@@ ting to those i@@ p addres@@ ses .
here &apos;s a couple related examples .
if you look here at the dots , compare no@@ de b in the upp@@ er left to no@@ de d in the far right ; b has four friends coming out from him and d has six friends coming out from him .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
remember , that thing is just about 30 micro@@ meters across .
optimism is sometimes charac@@ teri@@ zed as a belief , an intellectual post@@ ure .
this is a tele@@ cent@@ r@@ o in sa@@ o pau@@ lo .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still search@@ ing for my identi@@ ty , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
and he has been very happy .
it is not being used in regular diagno@@ stic ima@@ ging .
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magi@@ cal place called dar@@ pa ?
the path right now is like an ac@@ or@@ n ; it &apos;s still in its early phase .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assem@@ ble this , right ?
i called down to the end , &quot; hey , you haven &apos;t said much .
you know , i like to call it &quot; the national automo@@ bile sl@@ um . &quot;
remarkable stories , goo@@ d-@@ news stories , all of which bo@@ il down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to dete@@ ct early and inter@@ v@@ ene early .
working with a team of physici@@ sts , dr. de@@ bor@@ ah rho@@ des developed a new tool for tumor dete@@ ction that &apos;s 3 times as effective as traditional mammo@@ gra@@ ms for women with den@@ se breast tissue . the life@@ -@@ saving imp@@ lications are st@@ unning . so why haven &apos;t we heard of it ? rho@@ des shares the story behind the tool &apos;s creation , and the web of politics and economics that keep it from main@@ stream use .
the other one says , &quot; fine . looks good to me .
but we more than make up for that .
the ones that couldn &apos;t we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four .
now , i am all for the i@@ pad , but trust me -- sm@@ elling it will get you no@@ where .
tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
ok , there &apos;s two things i like about this .
and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of can@@ e .
and when you love , how does it feel ?
or perhaps he was just a yog@@ i who was sitting on a rock , star@@ ing at the sky and the sun and the moon .
and it uses what &apos;s called a bin@@ -@@ pac@@ king algorith@@ m .
so the only things i could man@@ age to ob@@ tain was a kind of a com@@ promise .
the reason why you have to build these teles@@ cop@@ es in places like the at@@ ac@@ ama desert is because of the high al@@ titude desert .
it also , money often makes us feel very sel@@ fish and we do things only for ourselves .
and i thought , &quot; a@@ w , that &apos;s really sweet .
and i said , &quot; yes , i would love to do that . it sounds great . &quot;
a lot of kids these days like to play games , but now they want to make them , and it &apos;s difficult , because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program .
they tend to bi@@ te each other , often quite fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ously and usually on the face .
then come con@@ vul@@ sions .
and even though they &apos;re used in lab@@ s to pro@@ mote human lives , they &apos;re also consi@@ dered pe@@ sts .
what is terrorism ?
i want to stay out of the way .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
ace of diam@@ onds .
now ju@@ dy bon@@ ds is a coal min@@ er &apos;s daughter .
there &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
can you p@@ ly your mind for that one way that you can respon@@ d to the problem ?
but today the he@@ ja@@ z ra@@ il@@ way lies in tat@@ ters , ru@@ ins .
that blue line there is my brain@@ wave .
and i supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
and he said , &quot; le@@ on@@ ar@@ do , were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid ? &quot;
but there &apos;s actually a lot more to compu@@ tation than that .
and now , 14 of the dis@@ orders are treat@@ able , two of them actually cur@@ able .
and you know how there are people that , when they realize that vulner@@ ability and ten@@ der@@ ness are important , that they sur@@ ren@@ der and walk into it .
yet all of these innova@@ tions -- that &apos;s what they said in the bro@@ ch@@ ure .

and the third said , &quot; let &apos;s find another director . &quot;
when dr. mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , j@@ r@@ . was ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ated , that day , everybody in my community was up@@ set .

fli@@ pping through pa@@ ges is rea@@ ders experience , and i &apos;m responsible for this experience .
but it &apos;s not at the expen@@ se of people accep@@ ting their global responsi@@ bilities .
businesses want different things .
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mi@@ es &apos; 19@@ 2@@ 8 tower for ber@@ lin , the question might be , &quot; well , where &apos;s the sun ? &quot;
okay ? ready ? let &apos;s do it .
if you google &quot; evil , &quot; a word that should surely have with@@ ered by now , you come up with 13@@ 6 million h@@ its in a third of a second .
you put down your arro@@ whe@@ ads and say , &quot; i &apos;d like to trade these arro@@ whe@@ ads for finished arro@@ ws . i &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
r@@ s@@ w : at a certain point a number of years ago , people -- when michael gra@@ ves was a fashion , before te@@ ap@@ ots ...
we sha@@ ved five days off the previ@@ ous best time .
what the star@@ rs did next , though , was surprising .
and we need to do something about it right now .
but of course , life is more than just ex@@ otic chemi@@ stry .
av : we , or i ?
so the next and final question was , well , how much force does a man@@ tis shrimp produce if they &apos;re able to break open s@@ na@@ ils ?
the first is the population that studied in a lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ based classroom .
the rocket &apos;s position is shown by the tra@@ je@@ ctory that we &apos;re now looking at .
and the women , who i was so privi@@ le@@ ged to meet when there were three survi@@ vors , told these stories about lying in their c@@ ots in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp@@ s .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physi@@ ology , of psych@@ ology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that ex@@ ci@@ te me .
but actually , the nin@@ e-@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ long process of mol@@ ding and shap@@ ing that goes on in the wom@@ b is a lot more vis@@ cer@@ al and con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al than that .
we know the obstac@@ les that are in our way right now , in difficult times .
and suddenly it will fli@@ p , and start spinn@@ ing the opposite direction .
i don &apos;t know .
and on this d@@ ating site that i have created , called chemi@@ str@@ y@@ .com , i ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals , and i &apos;m watching who cho@@ os@@ es who to love .
anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in ad@@ her@@ ence , just as a result of this .
the point is that you can find u@@ kra@@ ini@@ an fol@@ k dan@@ cers and connect with them , because you want to be connected .
sho@@ cked , the ma@@ yo@@ r decided to step asi@@ de rather than partici@@ pate or lead a pro@@ cession that was o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly in support of organi@@ zed crime .
this is a ta@@ d@@ pole walker to take your ta@@ d@@ pole walking in the ev@@ ening .
what are the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics we can control for ?
a quar@@ ter of a milli@@ meter .
it &apos;s called &quot; bicycle . &quot; and this de@@ ck is very flexi@@ ble , but not so many people know , if you check , if you press at the right spots , you see how thin and flexi@@ ble this de@@ ck is , right ?
communication , the next c. this is critical .
look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she &apos;s going through ? -- and the copy says : &quot; he knows just how to give me go@@ os@@ e@@ bu@@ mp@@ s . &quot;
there are a lot of people in the west who are still skep@@ tical , or think this may just be an inter@@ medi@@ ate stage before much more al@@ ar@@ ming chaos .
this en@@ ables her to easily ride through the air curr@@ ents as if she &apos;s sli@@ ding along on the ocean wa@@ ves .
j@@ s : again .
ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates are addi@@ tives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexi@@ bility , dur@@ ability and transpar@@ ency .
that &apos;s the r@@ oss sea ice shelf on the right there .
they sta@@ yed there .
the hal@@ ter@@ es are actually gy@@ ros@@ cop@@ es .
to@@ d@@ d and pe@@ te got up to the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge , up in here , and it was a scene of complete chaos up there .
in fact we &apos;re fin@@ ishing a book which is called &quot; pleasure , &quot; which is about sen@@ su@@ al pleasure in spaces .
sick leave . yeah , you &apos;ll definitely want to take some time off .
so that &apos;s one tool that we can use to very quickly monit@@ or the history of a page .
and the way that he tells it , there was a guy , there was a famous chinese di@@ pl@@ om@@ at that showed up , and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could , quote , &quot; pass &quot; as chinese .
it was either you &apos;re a meat e@@ ater or you &apos;re a vege@@ t@@ arian , and i guess i just wasn &apos;t quite ready .
one of a dozen pak@@ istan@@ is who came to te@@ din@@ dia despite security h@@ ass@@ les enter@@ ing the country , fel@@ low as@@ her has@@ an shows photos of ordinary pak@@ istan@@ is that drive home a pro@@ found message for citizens of all nations : look beyond dis@@ pu@@ tes , and see the humanity we share .
but i think it could still benef@@ it from more discipline .
and everyone is responsible for the per cap@@ it@@ a emis@@ sion . &quot;
transpar@@ ency can be mis@@ dire@@ cted .
so one particular day when i was feeling a little depres@@ sed and not a lot of jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re , i ended up in the local boo@@ k@@ store around the corner from our off@@ ices .
so what &apos;s inside of this machine is what en@@ ables me to do the things that i &apos;m doing with the medical data .
and we are starting a biom@@ edi@@ cal engineering program , so that we will train people lo@@ cally , who can repair that equipment .
we contribu@@ te to that squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze by de@@ pos@@ iting food in bins here in britain and el@@ sewhere in the world . we take food off the market shel@@ ves that hun@@ gry people depend on .
and for decades , i &apos;m going , why does this happen ? what can i do about it ? how can i change this ? i mean there must be something .
a@@ a sure . you know , under@@ cover is all about se@@ tting the pri@@ orities right , so we got people to take me to cour@@ t .
skin dis@@ plac@@ ement : another big deal .
we just spent an entire week talking about innova@@ tions and advan@@ c@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements , but you know why we need all of those innova@@ tions and advan@@ c@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements ?
photographer james bal@@ o@@ g shares new image sequences from the extreme ice survey , a network of ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se cameras recor@@ ding gl@@ aci@@ ers re@@ ce@@ ding at an al@@ ar@@ ming rate , some of the most vi@@ vid evidence yet of climate change .
one feature is the tradition of religi@@ ous du@@ al@@ ism : consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
i &apos;ll just put that list up for a few seconds , and see if you can guess which two -- i would estimate that probably two of these top@@ ics inspired probably 90 percent of the re@@ action in the various re@@ vie@@ ws and radio interviews .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t ta@@ sted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
you suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crow@@ ning achiev@@ ement of nature , human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world .
we addres@@ sed on the board the major questions that have not been answer@@ ed .
someone &apos;s love , someone &apos;s baby .
at night when i go to bed , 3 - 4 a.@@ m. in the morning , i lie down , close my eyes , and i see these lines and cir@@ cles and different shapes floating around .
but does this pro@@ ve that these se@@ als con@@ tain dra@@ vi@@ dian nam@@ es based on planets and star con@@ stell@@ ations ?
and then we will need another 10 , 15 years with space projects to get the spec@@ tra of earth@@ -@@ like planets like the one i showed you .
or how bad it can be at its worst .
the motor of the brain . it &apos;s a drive .
so i went out , collected the du@@ ck , and before i put it in the free@@ zer , i che@@ cked if the victi@@ m was indeed of the male sex .
so i &apos;m at the end of this bad break@@ up , i &apos;m 30 years old , i figure i &apos;m probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before i &apos;m ready to get mon@@ o@@ gam@@ ous and before we can sort of co@@ hab@@ it@@ ate , and we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged .
we know because it says so inside the code .
i want it to keep flying .
but in order to susta@@ in the hori@@ zon@@ tal line -- because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver -- we need to also develop the ver@@ tical line : system su@@ sten@@ ance , high-@@ level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for app@@ li@@ cation , and finally markets .
around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also ad@@ vising , usually wr@@ ong@@ ly , about everything that &apos;s going on on the computer .
we are a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ heavy culture in more ways than one .
and i know that watching that atom@@ ic bomb going off had a very , very big impact on my late father .
but if you got attac@@ ked , that was something you could do something about .
it &apos;s so simple , so ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive .
nothing says &quot; i love you &quot; like &quot; let me find somebody else i give a dam@@ n about . &quot;
&quot; oh , by the way de@@ an . it &apos;s going to fit on a 50@@ th per@@ centi@@ le female frame -- nam@@ ely 3@@ 2 in@@ ches from the long finger -- and wei@@ gh less than nine pounds . &quot;
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
and when i see ed &apos;s photographs i think , why the hell am i going to china ? it &apos;s true .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; what the he@@ ck ? &quot;
and the near@@ est star is 4@@ .@@ 2 light years away , which means its light takes 4@@ .@@ 2 years to get here .
so we &apos;ve been eating , drin@@ king , thinking , living public space for quite a long time .
i &apos;m put on full life support , and i have a massive stro@@ ke , and my brain dro@@ ps into a com@@ a .
so it &apos;s better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that .
it &apos;s now in virginia and london . and we built software that &apos;ll link func@@ tional magnetic reson@@ ance ima@@ ging devices up over the internet . i guess we &apos;ve done up to six machines at a time , but let &apos;s just focus on two .
look at mr@@ s. j@@ ones . look at the study , tell me what you think . &quot;
so how much is there ?
so that was the ultimate reason to do well . take a look -- everyone &apos;s watching prei@@ ty zin@@ ta .
and we had to start construction the next day .
and i went to car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on , and i ear@@ ned my ph@@ d in robo@@ tics .
they say , well , we have a thing in a box , and we have its in@@ puts and its out@@ puts .
and let &apos;s face it , any new re@@ tro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
you drive down .
what it does is it creates an adver@@ s@@ ari@@ al relationship between civil society and government over the control and ow@@ ner@@ ship of information .
these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rub@@ ber from the rub@@ ber tree .
and right behind him is l@@ . r@@ on hu@@ bb@@ ard . so -- you can see we &apos;re in the as@@ co@@ t , which is always good .
and that &apos;s exactly the way the higgs mechanism works .
my family ... what can i say ?
and he was so full , he was so happy and so fat eating this se@@ al , that , as i approach@@ ed him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture , his only defen@@ se was to keep eating more se@@ al .
so , the guy is telling the c@@ at , don &apos;t you d@@ are think outside the box .
as long as the city &apos;s putting out notic@@ es like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren &apos;t going to be engaged .
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans ma@@ ting ? &quot;
it &apos;s the idea of an ever@@ -@@ ever@@ -@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but susta@@ ined , above all , by pl@@ ur@@ alist democracy .
and it turns out that you &apos;re right and i &apos;m wrong .
instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the american population .
most probably , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achiev@@ ements is the invention of the alphab@@ et , and that has been at@@ tribu@@ ted to mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia with their invention of c@@ un@@ ei@@ form in 1@@ 600 b@@ c , followed by hier@@ o@@ gl@@ yp@@ hi@@ cs in egyp@@ t , and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact .
so they &apos;re putting a lot of strate@@ gic investment focused in this area .
it &apos;s called schi@@ zophren@@ ia , and you are dead also .
what if human consciousness isn &apos;t the en@@ d-@@ all and be@@ -@@ all of dar@@ win@@ ism ? what if we are all just pa@@ wns in cor@@ n &apos;s cle@@ ver strategy game to rule the earth ? author michael poll@@ an as@@ ks us to see the world from a plant &apos;@@ s-@@ eye view .
the genes are forced into producing all this m@@ ye@@ lin , all the fat to my@@ el@@ in@@ ate the brain .

i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the streng@@ th that ar@@ is@@ es when natural compassion is really present .

arti@@ ficial re@@ tin@@ as , the ability to put these ar@@ ra@@ ys on the back of the eye@@ ball and allow the blind to see .
so i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you that there &apos;s a lot of great , interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force , or whether you can take advan@@ tage of how nature makes materials , to make things that nature hasn &apos;t yet dre@@ amed of making .
and everything but -- four of these light objects are stars , and you can see them there -- little pl@@ uses .

because there was no way -- whatever they do , it &apos;s known the same time .
you have facebook , we have ren@@ ren .
and the other thing is the high inci@@ dence of hac@@ kers like these who have charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics which are consi@@ stent with as@@ per@@ ger &apos;s syndro@@ me .
so in my lab , we bring ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan , we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people , their minds , their mental states , their emotions , and one of the fin@@ dings that we &apos;ve found several times now , as have other lab@@ s around the world , is part of the pre@@ frontal cortex called medi@@ al pre@@ frontal cortex , which is shown in blue on the slide , and it &apos;s right in the middle of pre@@ frontal cortex in the mi@@ d@@ line of your head .
this is not extreme . it &apos;s a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us fle@@ w open .

in 2003 , when i ste@@ pped out of the p@@ ure play cap@@ itali@@ stic sector to work on so@@ -@@ called social sector issues , i definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pur@@ sue and find for@@ -@@ profit solutions to addres@@ sing pres@@ sing public issues .
but how simple ?
and i was ro@@ tating it in 3d and saying , &quot; i understand now . &quot;
but i must quickly add that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the west .
the way we &apos;re going to run this -- we have no idea what we &apos;re going to dis@@ cover .

well , i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school play@@ ground . it was a satur@@ day , and he was all by himself , just ki@@ cking a ball against the side of a wall .
this is normal science .
so it seems that the only tra@@ it that survi@@ ves de@@ cap@@ itation is van@@ ity .
and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invest@@ ed in ow@@ ning and controll@@ ing the world understood that the supp@@ res@@ sion of this particular cell , the op@@ pression of these cells , the rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of these cells , the under@@ min@@ ing of these cells , getting us to believe in the weak@@ ness of these cells and the cr@@ us@@ hing , er@@ adi@@ c@@ ating , destro@@ ying , redu@@ cing these cells , basically began the process of killing off the girl cell , which was , by the way , patri@@ arch@@ y .

and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can .
so you make all these 3d shapes .

by man@@ date , you cannot make a person com@@ passionate .
you can plu@@ g in and experience what it &apos;s like to be someone else .
every one of us imp@@ acts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re brea@@ thing oxygen and giving out co2 , and probably going to the lo@@ o , and things like that -- you &apos;re making a difference in the world .
a child can navi@@ gate with an x@@ box controller or a game controller .

i came up with a solution to this problem , and i came up with a solution based on adap@@ tive op@@ tics for this .

and we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
the other thing that we &apos;ve done , as we &apos;ve continued to increase dem@@ and , is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs .
we made this map for j@@ on to try to show him exactly where poli@@ o still exists .

and how can we do that ?
these are hu@@ gely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves .
so this is the founda@@ tions of what &apos;s called , tradition@@ ally , liber@@ al political theory and new@@ ton@@ ian physics .
when i say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous , but i can only come to the conclu@@ sion that it was what , in the alien ab@@ du@@ c@@ tee community , they call a &quot; screen memory &quot; : a ridiculous fal@@ se re@@ collection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being ki@@ dn@@ apped and flo@@ wn off to a sex pyramid .
when you live that way , when you live with that kind of passion , there &apos;s no time , there &apos;s no time for regre@@ ts , you &apos;re just moving forward .
one of the great stories i love to tell is about my love of going to my hom@@ et@@ own of new york and walking up park a@@ venue on a beautiful day and ad@@ mi@@ ring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world .
our vision , which works so well in air , all of a sudden is very restri@@ cted and cl@@ au@@ st@@ rop@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
and we created the san fern@@ and@@ o institute for applied media .
return to the ar@@ my .
so co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e then goes to the ger@@ man@@ s who are running the prison camp .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
well , one of the things that is really critical to try to di@@ still from that experience is that in addi@@ tion to that , people ask me and say , &quot; well , how did your parents treat you when you were a child ? &quot;
what can we do in a case like ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s ?
you can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the radio sh@@ ack .
i was born in swi@@ tzer@@ land and raised in ghana , west africa .
and i was thinking that your body hat@@ ed it , at the time , because we are very imm@@ une to this . this is called alp@@ ha@@ -@@ g@@ al ep@@ it@@ op@@ e .
then we repe@@ ated all those experiments with the ants mar@@ ked .
vin@@ ay ven@@ kat@@ ra@@ man : technology cra@@ f@@ ts for the digit@@ ally under@@ served
now , the story behind tas@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of ko@@ be .
but i just want to finish by talking about something that we &apos;re working on in the future .
look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of sha@@ dow@@ y moving in there -- yeah , it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s no trick .
they took up the challenge , and korea was able to double the propor@@ tion of students achiev@@ ing exc@@ ell@@ ence in one decade in the field of reading .
as the surface of the ocean gets war@@ mer , the water is ligh@@ ter when it &apos;s war@@ mer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
and that &apos;s because there is no clean water to drink , or in countries like india , people don &apos;t know that they need to so@@ ap their hands before de@@ fe@@ cation .
what could the future of animal products look like ?
and this one is evolved to m@@ im@@ ic a gl@@ os@@ sy metal@@ lic surface you see on some be@@ et@@ les .
look at the sky .
that would be bad .
that &apos;s amazing parallel and distribu@@ ted compu@@ ting power , new design possi@@ bilities .
on the one hand , there &apos;s the wan@@ ting processes .
in other words , for this community , they have this garden in the sky .
and he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students .
aids is the same kind of thing . it &apos;s co@@ stly to avo@@ id aids .
process@@ or performance on in@@ tel chips , the average price of a transi@@ st@@ or -- 196@@ 8 , you could buy one transi@@ st@@ or for a dollar .
i love her , you know .
in 19@@ 18 , we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed 20 million people .
so i want to show you a clip of ap@@ ha@@ en@@ o@@ ga@@ ster desert ants in professor stephen pr@@ att &apos;s lab car@@ rying an object .
you all probably inten@@ ded to wake up , i don &apos;t know , 6 : 30 , 7 a.@@ m .
when you go on a thing like this , we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months , with a team as small as 20 or 30 , to as big as 150 .
well , what did i do when i was a kid ?
and now , what happens is that the people of the upp@@ er city , they su@@ ck up all the water .
this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , e. col@@ i .
your parents may not have plan@@ ned you , but i believe god did .
but the details of the process are still in significant contro@@ ver@@ sy .
the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m f@@ ed up with this tyran@@ ny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
and then , on the other side of the room , the designers are making small ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments , sket@@ ching , drawing by hand , putting it in the computer .
what we do is actually put a standard h@@ va@@ c filter on the top of that .
and then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way .
i sei@@ ze comm@@ and by physical pro@@ w@@ ess , and i keep it by be@@ ating my ch@@ est , and you make sub@@ mis@@ sive gest@@ ures .
and what doesn &apos;t work is fear of dying , and that &apos;s what &apos;s normally used .
is your work going to lead to any recom@@ men@@ da@@ tions in education , to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fair@@ er moral jud@@ g@@ ments ?
we &apos;re s@@ mitten with technology .
his team have been making deta@@ iled calcul@@ ations of the relative imp@@ acts of different energy sour@@ ces .
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had ma@@ ke@@ up artists , je@@ wel@@ ry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my we@@ d@@ ding an art installation .
but what they really do , which is very powerful , and that is what governments in the late &apos; 9@@ 0s started doing if they don &apos;t like independent media companies -- you know , they thre@@ aten your adver@@ tis@@ ers .
the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil got its name from the terri@@ fying no@@ c@@ tur@@ n@@ al scre@@ am that it makes .
and the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash .
as we speak , there are 1@@ 17 or so clinical trials resear@@ ching the use of stem cells for li@@ ver diseases .
&#91; alle@@ gi@@ ance &#93; &#91; very inti@@ mate &#93; &#91; serious mistakes &#93; and tat@@ to@@ os tell you a lot of stories .
so , working with local water tru@@ sts , we created an in@@ cen@@ tive to do so .
now i hope most of you are thinking , &quot; what ? that sounds simple . &quot;
now com@@ as are measu@@ red on a scale from 15 down to three .
however , what matters most -- more than training or lu@@ ck -- is the heart .
and in afghanistan , we &apos;re trying new approach@@ es -- access negoti@@ ators .
no good just hir@@ ing employees , you also have to hi@@ re other employees to man@@ age those employees and to en@@ force the goals of the institution and so forth .
last year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing inci@@ dent in a southern o@@ em manufacturing com@@ po@@ und in china : 13 young workers in their late te@@ ens and early 20@@ s commit@@ ted su@@ i@@ cide , just one by one like caus@@ ing a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease .
in two words , very carefully .
and it fre@@ es us all up to do other things -- to sit at ted me@@ et@@ ings and not to worry about our food .
it &apos;s a pretty har@@ ro@@ wing link@@ age between what &apos;s happening to our environment and what &apos;s happening to our human rights .
but i &apos;ll tell you , there is no advent@@ ure more har@@ ro@@ wing than ri@@ ding sh@@ ot@@ gun with mar@@ ge de@@ ton .
as i said , they were advent@@ ur@@ ous people .
so i &apos;m doing activi@@ ties that will build my sense of balance .
i think we &apos;re going to move from a homo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens into a homo evol@@ u@@ tis .
yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
so , these little details help to make it work , make it real .
i would send out my books . i would send out hundreds of post@@ car@@ ds to edi@@ tors and art dire@@ ctors , but they would go un@@ answer@@ ed .
but listen : experts who are serious about disease redu@@ ction recom@@ mend that adults eat just over half a po@@ und of meat per week .
and i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff , and build stuff , and potenti@@ ally distribu@@ te stuff .
so now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been spending every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pause the videos , what did they stop watching , what exer@@ cis@@ es are they using , what have they been focused on ?
it is the story factory , one of the very best in the world .
and instead of ap@@ pl@@ ying fe@@ e@@ ble human minds to desig@@ ning these tools from scratch , there were these read@@ y-@@ made solutions right out there in nature developed and re@@ fin@@ ed ste@@ adi@@ ly for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all .
and most important , a wise person does this impro@@ vising and ru@@ le-@@ ben@@ ding in the service of the right aims .
the career that i started early on in my life was looking for ex@@ otic life forms in ex@@ otic places , and at that time i was working in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic and the ar@@ c@@ tic , and high deser@@ ts and low deser@@ ts .
how much does the ball cost ? quick .
it looks like a giant h@@ amp@@ ton inn .
it is a pain in the ar@@ se .
and this is the region most clos@@ ely associated with deser@@ ti@@ fication .
and at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves , would we want to sh@@ at@@ ter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits ?
in 19@@ 70 , the dam bur@@ sts . the dam bur@@ sts .
open your eyes , e@@ z@@ ra .
we create our lives sym@@ bio@@ tically as we explore our tal@@ ents in rel@@ ation to the circumstances they help to create for us .
so it &apos;s not just something you do in your sp@@ are time .
which just , i hope in 100 years , people will look back and go , &quot; wow . &quot;
and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising in@@ comes but also a few key break@@ through@@ s : vaccin@@ es that were used more widely .
i &apos;ve got to war@@ n you : the sense in which my world@@ view is up@@ beat has always been kind of subtle , sometimes even el@@ u@@ sive .
one of them is , you can , just ask this simple question . this question never fa@@ ils .
isn &apos;t it just a lot of fun ? &quot;
i worked and studied hard to move up the career la@@ d@@ der , eventually becoming a ch@@ ie@@ f financial off@@ ic@@ er in si@@ lic@@ on valley , a job i really enjo@@ yed .
and , as an out@@ growth of all of this then , i wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transpor@@ ting earth@@ -@@ type life to other planets .
and this is going to be an instrument to dete@@ ct earth@@ -@@ like planets around sun@@ -@@ like stars .
lg : very good .
and increasingly , everything that people buy , every consu@@ mer product , in one way or another , can be person@@ alized .
here is an example of our a@@ eri@@ al camera .
public space .
i have some stories that are hu@@ mor@@ ous , like &quot; dead be@@ ats . &quot;
you can say a mi@@ ra@@ cle occur@@ s .
and then i was over@@ whel@@ med with shame .
but this is rar@@ ely a good sig@@ n . right ?
and , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is .
so that &apos;s one way in which we think place cells deter@@ mine where the animal is as it &apos;s exploring around .
so instead of in@@ ser@@ ting a wire into one spot of the brain , re-@@ engineer the brain itself so that some of its neur@@ al elements become responsive to diff@@ us@@ ely broad@@ cast signals such as a f@@ lash of light .
the pack sta@@ ys together .
bed@@ ou@@ ins call the cam@@ el the gift of god .
9@@ ,@@ 7@@ 58 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
it &apos;s really lovely .
so we use this state-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art en@@ cryp@@ tion to boun@@ ce stuff around the internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ ils , pass it through legal jur@@ is@@ di@@ ctions like swe@@ den and bel@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those legal prote@@ ctions .
we didn &apos;t know if he had per@@ ished yet until 3@@ 6 hours later .
it turns out that one of the best ways to look at micro@@ bes and to understand them is to look at their dna .
we found life in the extre@@ mes .
the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles .
i was lost .
i was vis@@ iting with an artist , michael hei@@ zer , out in the desert near las vegas somewhere .
this is from &quot; triumph of the will &quot; -- brilliant edi@@ ting to cut together things .
you have to keep their attention .
and these sequences are auto@@ -@@ associ@@ a@@ tively re@@ called , so if i see something , i hear something , it re@@ minds me of it , and then it plays back auto@@ matically .
mark app@@ leb@@ aum : the ma@@ d scientist of music
here is the critical difference between these : l@@ ol@@ cat@@ s is commun@@ al value .
they affect our bank accoun@@ ts .
so , i need to deci@@ ph@@ er what i wrote .
but they &apos;re necessary : they &apos;re necessary to make that mathematics work .
so what we did is we collected some sam@@ ples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals , trained rat@@ s on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 8@@ 9 percent sensi@@ tivity , 8@@ 6 percent speci@@ fi@@ city using multiple rat@@ s in a row .
so what ended up happening , actually , is they ended up increasing the out@@ brea@@ ks of ch@@ ol@@ era because , as we now know , ch@@ ol@@ era is actually in the water .
so even though when the po@@ w@@ der was poison , the friend dr@@ ank the coffee and died , people say gra@@ ce deser@@ ves less bl@@ ame in that case , when she inno@@ cent@@ ly thought it was su@@ gar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison and no har@@ m occur@@ red .
she y@@ elled at me like she never had before .
my colleagues in par@@ li@@ am@@ ent inclu@@ de , in my new in@@ take , family doctors , bus@@ in@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , profess@@ ors , dist@@ ingu@@ ished econom@@ ists , histor@@ i@@ ans , wri@@ ters , ar@@ my off@@ ic@@ ers ran@@ ging from colon@@ els down to regi@@ mental ser@@ ge@@ ant maj@@ ors .
it is a very ge@@ ologi@@ cally active body .
and our hope is that , by fig@@ uring out brain circu@@ its at a level of abstra@@ ction that lets us repair them and engineer them , we can take some of these in@@ tra@@ ct@@ able dis@@ orders that i told you about earlier , prac@@ tically none of which are cu@@ red , and in the 21st century make them history .
lou@@ ise le@@ ak@@ ey talked yesterday about how we &apos;re the only one in this bran@@ ch left .
the way the cost of what i squ@@ ander , what is lost , if ever i forget that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot;
so enormous ex@@ ca@@ va@@ tions and a lot of work , and out of essentially a parti@@ al her@@ d of dinosau@@ rs that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material -- we er@@ e@@ ct job@@ aria , a sau@@ ro@@ po@@ d dinosau@@ r like we haven &apos;t seen on some other contin@@ ents .
and i actually went to see some of the design companies in h@@ ong kon@@ g in my stay there .
and here i became a bit au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous , and i turned and i asked the judge , i said , &quot; your hon@@ or , i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself . &quot;
so instead , i turned to video , and video is the next best way to preser@@ ve and memor@@ i@@ alize someone and to capture a specific moment in time .
i mean , what are we fighting over right now ?
thank you very much .
thank god i was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there .
it was adv@@ oc@@ ating friends and a d@@ ot@@ ing sister .
and the one that i did not sub@@ mit , which i still like , i wanted to use the same phr@@ ase .
the fin@@ ale de@@ fi@@ es logic , gives new insight into the problem , and au@@ dien@@ ces express their amaz@@ ement with lau@@ ghter .
so cut to now . we still have an energy crisis , and now we have a climate crisis as well . you know , so humans generate about 12 trillion watts , or 12 ter@@ a@@ watts , from fossil fu@@ els .
let me take you to the real china .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
so we &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that &apos;s our lab .
we can talk about the economic imp@@ acts of these festi@@ v@@ als on their cities , but i &apos;m much &#91; more &#93; interested in many more things , like how a festi@@ val helps a city to express itself , how it lets it come into its own .
as funny as it sounds , artic@@ ul@@ ating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this contro@@ ver@@ sy , i would have said , &quot; that &apos;s kind of true . &quot;
if you sho@@ ot a partic@@ le at them and kno@@ ck a hole in them , they repair themselves ; they go zi@@ p and they repair the hole in fe@@ mt@@ os@@ econ@@ ds , which is not -- is really quick .
no to violence : ra@@ my es@@ sam came to ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r on the second day of the revolution , one month after mu@@ bar@@ ak ste@@ pped down , this was his reward .
okay , i &apos;ll help you . fourth one .
and at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on ag@@ gr@@ ession and competition .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
but you know what ? i was getting work experience .
as ri@@ ad@@ h gu@@ er@@ fal@@ i , the veter@@ an digital ac@@ tivist from tun@@ isi@@ a , re@@ mar@@ ked over this inci@@ dent , &quot; before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other .
very briefly , let &apos;s look at some businesses . i@@ b@@ m , as you know , h@@ p , sun -- some of the most fi@@ er@@ ce competi@@ tors in the it world are open sour@@ cing their software , are provi@@ ding port@@ fo@@ li@@ os of pat@@ ents for the common@@ s .
this is what we &apos;re ser@@ ving this week at the schools .
if we &apos;re looking at iran , the president of the united states we would like to think , may have some influence -- certainly the president in iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power la@@ d@@ der because that person doesn &apos;t know much about iran , or about energy policy , or about health care , or about any particular policy .
i start with my idea . i abstra@@ ct it .
none of those things were stir@@ ring .
13@@ ,000 girls studying here in the ro@@ oms under@@ ground , full of sc@@ or@@ pi@@ ons .
now , an adult en@@ counter@@ ing a new situation -- when we en@@ coun@@ ter a new situation we have a ten@@ den@@ cy to want to cat@@ eg@@ ori@@ ze it just as quickly as we can , you know .
our house was being destro@@ yed by car@@ p@@ enter ants .
so thank you very much for being here . thank you very much .
but at least it &apos;s just a kind of art@@ work to explore our ideas about a different future .
about 16@@ ,000 species of ne@@ ma@@ tode wor@@ ms have been discovered and diagn@@ os@@ ed by scientists ; there could be hundreds of thousands of them , even millions , still un@@ known .
and we define ourselves by our g@@ aps .
but things are also changing at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
so a few years later , and it &apos;s now 1997 , and i &apos;m in ang@@ ol@@ a under@@ cover investig@@ ating blood diam@@ onds .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
and all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system , how complex they are .
until one day in nin@@ th grade , when i was standing with a number of the foot@@ ball pla@@ yers .
so i decided to do this symbo@@ lic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be fro@@ zen over , but which now is rapidly un@@ free@@ zing .
then , number two , we keep these rules a secret from the dog .
tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you &apos;ve worked on .
and we asked ourselves , why couldn &apos;t it be ex@@ hibi@@ tion@@ istic , like the met , or like some of the other buildings at lincoln center ?
one of the thre@@ ads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le what the big wants -- the &quot; big &quot; being the organization , the system , the country -- and what the &quot; small &quot; wants -- the individual , the person .
so to address this , we developed with a dr. brown in stanford : virtual dis@@ section table .
so the idea is : how to integra@@ te these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
and that was what really got me puzz@@ led .
which was em@@ it@@ ting the most co2 ?
the most important thing to take from the per@@ cent@@ age system is this : if you have ga@@ y people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identi@@ fy as somewhere closer to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trou@@ ble .
that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain dis@@ orders , brain circu@@ it dis@@ orders , has a behavi@@ or@@ al dis@@ order .
i feel that i have dig@@ nity that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
and charles ii , the son , was finally put back on the thr@@ one of england .
and , basically , none of them could solve it .
and i hope there &apos;s someone in here from the oxford english di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary , because i want to talk to you later .
so it &apos;s kind of like if your house cat@@ ches on fire .
the challenge occur@@ s when there is an injury .
in the 17@@ th century , a woman named gi@@ uli@@ a to@@ fan@@ a had a very successful per@@ fu@@ me business .
like this character . remember these guys ?
but the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in banglades@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor banglades@@ hi .
and they use them , in the brea@@ ks , for water p@@ ist@@ ols .
but look at all the elec@@ tro@@ des around it .
and we see a dri@@ ft towards complexity that &apos;s very intui@@ tive .
most people think that i was an ac@@ tr@@ ess . i was never an ac@@ tr@@ ess . &quot;
so let &apos;s think about a disease that affects -- it &apos;s pretty rare , it affects one person in 10,000 .
and i &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a priv@@ ate house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
so i think there &apos;s a very good chance there &apos;s about 30 or 40 psychop@@ a@@ ths in this room .
i saw la@@ yers of security .
and on christ@@ mas day , i was in ban@@ g@@ k@@ ok with a group of photograp@@ hers and got a tele@@ gra@@ m -- back in those days , you got tele@@ gra@@ ms -- from time magazine saying someone in korea had died , and left their child in a will to me .
and in pap@@ u@@ a new gu@@ in@@ ea , they were making stone ax@@ es until two decades ago , just as a course of practical matters .
so they say , &quot; yes it &apos;s wrong , but sup@@ pos@@ ing it was right ... &quot;
so , this story of the evolution of dance seems str@@ angel@@ y familiar .
thank you .
just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do -- it &apos;s hop@@ eless to predict a single molecule -- yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics , very accur@@ ately .
we know that these were used for st@@ amp@@ ing c@@ lay tags that were atta@@ ched to b@@ und@@ les of goo@@ ds that were sent from one place to the other .
will never ga@@ ther up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
instead of making fo@@ ods that look like things that you wouldn &apos;t eat , we decided to make ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents look like dis@@ h@@ es that you know .
ar@@ ou@@ sal addi@@ ction , you want different .
he went back to his cave . he medi@@ tated again .
i simply tied the end of a pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush onto a twi@@ g .
and that is , make me@@ a@@ dows and not law@@ ns .
time , pati@@ ence , sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty , understanding -- these are harder to give .
we were up in the mountains , 197@@ 6 .
that &apos;s the kind of argument we want .
mt : well , maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told them it could be used to contact other planets .
and i come from a long way .
and last , we talked about loss aver@@ sion , and the mon@@ keys and the ap@@ ples .
she &apos;s not sure that would have happened if the edi@@ tor had not been a female .
all right . why are you doing it ? you &apos;re certain it &apos;s good because you read it before , saw it before , but you &apos;re hop@@ ing it &apos;s been long enough you &apos;ve for@@ gotten , that there &apos;s variety .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sti@@ cking to their guns , regar@@ d@@ less of what other people want or recom@@ mend .
so , what i &apos;m argu@@ ing is that value &apos;s redu@@ ced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
it had no limits . it was inv@@ inci@@ ble .
we kill bacteria with traditional antibio@@ tics and that sele@@ cts for resist@@ ant mu@@ tan@@ ts .
we tou@@ red that for a long time . it is now perman@@ ently in vi@@ en@@ na , where we built a museum around it .
so we &apos;re left with a situation where we know that our earli@@ est an@@ ce@@ stors were moving around on four legs in the trees , before the sa@@ van@@ na ecosystem even came into exist@@ ence .
j@@ im ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , c@@ bs news , new york .
so through the mar@@ ath@@ on , we learned that political problems can be over@@ come .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
we were sitting in the kit@@ chen . sue k@@ leb@@ old was fix@@ ing dinner .
cancer , i found , is a pas@@ sport to inti@@ macy .
we were a little bit worried that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to suit our argument and just manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red this evidence , so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the un@@ ic@@ e@@ f index of child well-being .
so everybody got stuck at that $ 3@@ .@@ 50-@@ an-@@ hour job , and it turned out to be a dis@@ aster .
you can put shoes on your feet ; you can play golf with golf clu@@ bs ; and che@@ wed up bub@@ ble g@@ um doesn &apos;t do anything at all for you .
so , the first time i did that , i went , like , who@@ a ! like this .
and also they &apos;ve made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we &apos;ve seen , are un@@ sustainable .
and they said , &quot; ha . there won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ edu@@ le . &quot;
if you walked up to an o@@ ct@@ op@@ us tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arri@@ ved , the o@@ ct@@ op@@ us would rise up and look at you and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; is that guy really looking at me ? he is looking at me ! &quot;
i think the first one is that they got fo@@ ol@@ ed by history .
but the se@@ cul@@ ar-@@ min@@ ded people can be influ@@ enced by that .
to the right species of be@@ e , this looks like another very aggressi@@ ve be@@ e , and it goes and bon@@ ks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away , and , of course , cover@@ s itself with poll@@ en .
so , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?
and it starts getting really nice .
so what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re not only en@@ li@@ sting the mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tion@@ als , we &apos;re giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we &apos;re che@@ cking .
the prak@@ ash center will integra@@ te health care , education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to en@@ able them to bring about change , positive change , the gr@@ ass@@ roots has been streng@@ th@@ ened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analo@@ g models of control and comm@@ and .
it &apos;s out of print -- still ...
this hope is still alive .
now , are there down@@ sides to that ?
look at those young girls who go back to school when ac@@ id is thro@@ wn in their face . &quot;
you can buy a machine today for about $ 300 that you can create yourself , which is quite incredible .
we &apos;re trying to be as good as the breast cancer campa@@ ign .
in that case , a par@@ asi@@ te gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the bel@@ ly of a c@@ at .
how many of you think you would like to have ban@@ an@@ as during this hypo@@ the@@ tical ted event next week ?
&quot; bl@@ ess you , man . &quot;
i &apos;m on a mission to make sharing cool .
look around the room : cha@@ irs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to li@@ ck this problem .
here &apos;s a piece of coal .
what parts of you are just being seen ?
it was all just gone .
and so what do the mon@@ keys do ?
but the u.s. is los@@ ing its idea lea@@ der@@ ship .
better really hur@@ ry up .
if you &apos;re an average married couple , you &apos;re going to lie to your sp@@ ouse in one out of every 10 interactions .
governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year .
i made the front page of my hom@@ et@@ own paper that i deli@@ ver@@ ed for six years , you know ?
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer .
di@@ p@@ lo@@ macy needs to be well resour@@ ced , susta@@ ined , and apply the right mix of incenti@@ ves and pres@@ sur@@ es on leaders and follo@@ wers .
they somehow choose the direction that the for@@ a@@ gers will go , and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the for@@ a@@ gers that it &apos;s safe to go out .
so the whole thing has sort of morph@@ ed into this organic , ever@@ -@@ evol@@ ving creature , that &apos;s actually gone way beyond christ@@ ine and i .
this is cis@@ -@@ 3-@@ h@@ ex@@ en@@ e-@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . it sm@@ ells of cut gr@@ ass .
as it turns out , there is a strong relationship between min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing now and being un@@ happy a short time later , consi@@ stent with the idea that min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing is caus@@ ing people to be un@@ happy .
we spent much of our time with my mother co@@ o@@ king .
and now we &apos;ve got to look to the future .
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
&quot; are there any wit@@ n@@ esses ? &quot;
car@@ oly@@ n por@@ co : could a satur@@ n moon h@@ arb@@ or life ?
that , i believe , is going to bring peace to this particular conflict .
and that was only the beginning .
we were see@@ king normal human brains .
nt : here are the current students at aims . there are 5@@ 3 of them from 20 different countries , including 20 women .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful ren@@ di@@ tion of china , which even has tai@@ wan , and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shor@@ test le@@ ash , right ?
so i hope you &apos;re going to hear this .
c@@ s@@ i : climate .
this is a little bit of a problem , so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control , and this is really where the idea of review and pe@@ er review comes in .
why does it matter ? who car@@ es ?
someone did all eight videos -- a b@@ ass even sing@@ ing the sop@@ ran@@ o parts .
whereas china could get healthy much earlier , because they applied the knowledge of education , nutrition , and then also benefits of pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n and vaccin@@ es and family plan@@ ning .
i turn around , i go , &quot; hi . &quot;
so what i do is , i buy a pre@@ paid card like this .
and that was my entire month &apos;s r@@ ent .
and i would have lost my face .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
we should get out of our cultural ghet@@ to and go visit the next one and the next .
this novel training paradigm en@@ coura@@ ged the brain to create new connections , some rela@@ y circu@@ its that rela@@ y information from the brain past the injury and re@@ store cor@@ tical control over the lo@@ com@@ ot@@ or networks below the injury .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
je@@ an ri@@ t@@ ch@@ ie : in not@@ tam@@ un town , not a soul would look out , not a soul would look up , not a soul would look down . bo@@ b dylan : come you ma@@ sters of war , you that build the big guns , you that build the death plan@@ es , you that build all the bom@@ bs . kir@@ by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on : okay , so that &apos;s the same basic mel@@ o@@ dy and overall structure . this next one is &quot; the patri@@ ot game , &quot; by domin@@ ic beh@@ an . al@@ ong@@ side that , you &apos;re going to hear &quot; with god on our side , &quot; by dylan .
because in that high@@ est age cat@@ eg@@ ory of 7@@ 6 to 85 , as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them .
now , that is , actually , when you think about it -- we take it for granted -- it &apos;s actually a remarkable achiev@@ ement , to produce something that &apos;s that democratic .
the greater the contribu@@ tion , the more we express and form our individu@@ ality , which is so important to a lot of us who feel like re@@ je@@ cts to begin with .
even if you lie to yourself , you need to have split person@@ alities .
this actually is roughly , in man@@ -@@ years of work , 200@@ ,000 dollars roughly , if you keep them on the low sal@@ aries with no benefits .
even the people who market these clu@@ bs -- i mean , they &apos;ll say these have four axis sha@@ f@@ ts which minim@@ ize loss of club speed and there@@ by drive the ball far@@ ther -- but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 57@@ ,000 dollars worth of performance from these clu@@ bs .
this is the boat that that lady was pa@@ dd@@ ling around in , and this arti@@ san makes the boat and the pa@@ dd@@ les and s@@ ells directly to the people who need the boat and the pa@@ dd@@ les .
they don &apos;t move their families to the distri@@ ct .
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pan@@ crea@@ tic cancers at high levels in the bloo@@ d@@ stream in the earli@@ est sta@@ ges , but also only in cancer .
that &apos;s what re@@ min@@ ded me of it .
and during that time , i actually lost more rela@@ tives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a n@@ onlin@@ e@@ ar phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on starts to increase really , really rapidly .
these four different forces interact with matter according to the cor@@ respon@@ ding char@@ ges that each partic@@ le has .
and then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named mr@@ s. ed@@ gar ros@@ en@@ berg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
for that , we use an initi@@ al measu@@ re@@ ment unit .
and when we make the brain opera , we invi@@ te the public to come in , to try these instru@@ ments and then collabor@@ ate with us to help make each performance of the brain opera .
they don &apos;t have another thing they can do .
i didn &apos;t want to go with this ru@@ th@@ less pre@@ dat@@ or image .
and we all fall at different points , of course , along the introver@@ t / ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ t spectrum .
but one of the most popular ones involves green flu@@ ores@@ cent protein .
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding -- but these are the re@@ cap@@ it@@ ulation sli@@ des , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
this is why i went to afghanistan .
a second reason has to do with pe@@ er pressure .
and i said , &quot; do you regret it ?
that &apos;s the argument i want to make tonight .
c@@ p : yes and no .
in india it was just impossible to pa@@ ste .
this is a quote from al@@ bert einstein , who says , &quot; the intel@@ le@@ ct has little to do on the road to dis@@ covery .
and i &apos;ve also come to think that it &apos;s one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from ma@@ ting and re@@ production .
we were spending so much time with this le@@ op@@ ard and getting to understand her individu@@ al@@ ism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
thank you .
favorite number . i love that number .
this is &quot; 6@@ ,@@ 500 yards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 yards , &quot; after ger@@ hard ri@@ chter .
we say to ourselves , &quot; maybe we can make fish sti@@ cks with it or something . &quot;
bring it back up .
and soon enough , they start to learn about the meaning of things , because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is poin@@ ting at something , they &apos;re not just getting a dire@@ c@@ tional cu@@ e , they are getting the other person &apos;s meaning of that thing , the at@@ titude , and soon enough they start building this body of mean@@ ings , but mean@@ ings that were acqui@@ red within the real@@ m of social interaction .
and it is really fun to say .
i called my wife les@@ lie , and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
back to back is an australi@@ an company of people with intellectual dis@@ abilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the st@@ aten island fer@@ ry termin@@ al at rush hour .
there &apos;s this waiting hand from a human experim@@ enter , and may@@ day quickly fig@@ ures out , appar@@ ently the human wants this .
so these patterns of char@@ ges are not just pretty .
but what &apos;s great about it is , the forms are only a few hundred dollars .
and there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the power@@ house of the human body , sitting in my hands .
and because of this , we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology .
the vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
they &apos;ll be having two bot@@ t@@ les . ok ?
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection -- it &apos;s just done in a different way .
now this app is spa@@ w@@ ning itself from the data .
because if you do many things you get to feel l@@ ous@@ y about everything , and not just one , you know .
when we find a fossil , we mark it .
3 : 19 .
anyway , i know chris told us not to do pit@@ ches up here , but since i have all of your attention : we need inv@@ e@@ stors . end of pit@@ ch .
when that was published in a magazine i got an i@@ rate le@@ tter from my uncle .
i &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &apos;ve done during my first five tedtalks .
so you burn off the ha@@ agen@@ -@@ da@@ z@@ s from the night before ?
i don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot;
so , the first robot to talk about is called stri@@ der .
you may say this is not fair , because i &apos;m sel@@ ecting two countries to make a case against democracy .
so , i thought , could we have dar@@ i@@ us serve as our bab@@ y@@ c@@ am car@@ rier , and that way get the in@@ puts that we feed into dylan ?
and i &apos;m going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
our river is flo@@ wing and healthy and clean .
once you &apos;re in orbit , you are two thir@@ ds of the way , ener@@ ge@@ tically , to anywhere -- the moon , to mars . and today , there &apos;s only three vehicles -- the u.s. shu@@ ttle , the russi@@ an so@@ y@@ u@@ z and the chinese vehicle -- that gets you there .
i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . &quot;
this meant they must have been closer together in the past .
now , in the decade of dar@@ fu@@ r and iraq , a stat@@ ement like that might seem somewhere between hall@@ u@@ cin@@ atory and ob@@ scene . but i &apos;m going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture . the de@@ cl@@ ine of violence is a fra@@ ct@@ al phenomenon . you can see it over m@@ ill@@ en@@ nia , over centuries , over decades and over years , although there seems to have been a ti@@ pping point at the on@@ set of the age of reason in the si@@ x@@ te@@ ent@@ h century . one sees it all over the world , although not hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ously .
do you want extinct species back ?
that &apos;s just one source .
it &apos;s a fortun@@ e !
de@@ cor@@ ation of the un@@ finished project is a kind of con@@ cep@@ tual in@@ cu@@ b@@ ation .
now there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve discovered about social media that &apos;s actually quite surprising .
in his lat@@ est book , harvard professor steven pin@@ ker -- and many other thin@@ kers before him -- conclu@@ des that one of the main dri@@ vers behind less violent societies is the spread of the const@@ it@@ u@@ tional state and the introdu@@ ction on a large scale of the state mon@@ op@@ ol@@ y le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed by a democra@@ tically ele@@ cted government , le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed by che@@ cks and bal@@ ances and an independent ju@@ di@@ cial system .
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as dar@@ win@@ ian evolution .
and he should have said , &quot; what a strange , long trip it &apos;s about to become . &quot;
but that &apos;s not what we did .
we are in the middle of a tremendous clas@@ h between the old and the new .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues refle@@ cting their da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day lives , incredible things happened .
and this , we just wanted to show you -- if we can get the video running on this , yeah -- just an example of a little video sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce .
here he en@@ visions the car@@ c@@ ass of an au@@ t@@ ori@@ ck@@ sha@@ w he once wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed burning in a ri@@ ot .
it gives you the fal@@ se im@@ pression it &apos;s a map .
and it &apos;ll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .
we re@@ moved 12@@ 3,000 tons of con@@ cre@@ te only from the ri@@ ver@@ ban@@ ks .
imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly or ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly , there is a nar@@ ra@@ tive that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade , and we in@@ fer this because they were either tor@@ tured or ex@@ ecu@@ ted in a professional man@@ ner , or , most likely , both .
sil@@ ence is beautiful .
and you continue to make connections .
and we know from his con@@ tempor@@ aries that le@@ on@@ ar@@ do was a very hand@@ some , even beautiful man .
i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the ol@@ d-@@ growth forest as a matter of national defen@@ se .
they really want their world back .
this , de@@ ar friends , pos@@ es a human pressure on the planet of moment@@ ous scale .
we are sle@@ ep@@ walking into the future .
what did google come out with this year ?
not to mention what it re@@ ve@@ als about the adult who &apos;s speaking them .
a lot of people say now that business will li@@ ft up the developing econom@@ ies , and social business will take care of the rest .
the world needs people like you . thank you .
and the bit@@ ter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
we sig@@ ned a memor@@ and@@ um of understanding -- here &apos;s ma@@ dam den@@ g n@@ an , den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing &apos;s daughter -- for china to adop@@ t cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le .
so in the &apos; 60s , the u.s. was first .
the first problem was a conservation problem .
i tell them my story , that i am hiv-@@ positive , but my child is hiv-@@ negative .
it &apos;s a fal@@ c@@ on . it &apos;s called the eastern re@@ d-@@ foot@@ ed fal@@ c@@ on , obviously .
so she call@@ s it a real fa@@ ke .
these are the blue bars .
over the next few days , i began to realize that this qui@@ et@@ ness was not excep@@ tional .
i want you to take a look at this baby .
and after ump@@ teen sur@@ ger@@ ies and , you can imagine , really un@@ speak@@ able tragedy , he just said , &quot; that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done . that &apos;s enough .
and it was a gor@@ ge@@ ous day in the african sun , and the d@@ ust was flying and the girls were dan@@ cing , and there was this house , and it said , &quot; v-@@ day safe house for the girls . &quot;
what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
if we could redu@@ ce the us@@ age of paper to@@ wel@@ s , one paper to@@ we@@ l per person per day , 57@@ 1,@@ 23@@ 0,000 pounds of paper not used .
don &apos;t you love that kind of thing from college ?
and that book is very interesting . because it &apos;s about wi@@ tch trials , and how people thought back then .
education campa@@ ig@@ ns , like the one that the president is foc@@ using on in his fund@@ ing , may not be enough , at least not alone .
and all the symp@@ tom@@ s sta@@ yed the same or even got worse .
once , for example , i was intervie@@ wing this par@@ t-@@ ti@@ mer from the red briga@@ des .
i need you on board . i need you with me .
our agen@@ ticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
i gener@@ ally believe we &apos;re at an in@@ fle@@ ction point where the sharing behaviors -- through sites such as fli@@ ck@@ r and twitter that are becoming second nature online -- are being applied to off@@ line areas of our everyday lives .
i would have never imag@@ ined that , not in my wil@@ dest dreams did i think -- i don &apos;t even consider myself to be an author .
that should be the goal .
what &apos;d he say ? he said what surge@@ ons always say : &quot; we got it all . &quot;
ok .
all of my be@@ ver@@ ages are pac@@ ka@@ ged in plastic , even at the health food market .
i &#91; did &#93; a master &apos;s degree in economics .
you might not know that con@@ an do@@ yle went to medical school here in e@@ din@@ burgh , and his character , s@@ her@@ lo@@ ck hol@@ mes , was inspired by sir joseph bell .
i decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
from my home in california , i sha@@ ved char@@ lie in atlan@@ ta .
and it would be self-@@ ill@@ umin@@ ated , because now the sun &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light -- so let &apos;s make our little earth self-@@ ill@@ umin@@ ated .
at the beginning of class , i just per@@ ch it in the back of the classroom . it &apos;s not a perfect shot .
fs : oh , the form@@ at -- thank you for the question . yes , it &apos;s v@@ c@@ ds .
sop@@ ho@@ s _ vis@@ it@@ ors , san@@ se@@ me@@ a , companies i work with .
it &apos;s the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators .
and my daughter , who &apos;s three , when i dropped her off at pres@@ cho@@ ol , did that whole hu@@ g@@ g@@ ing-@@ the-@@ leg , cr@@ ying , &quot; mom@@ my , don &apos;t get on the plane &quot; thing .
you know , a while after tedtalks started taking off , we noticed that speak@@ ers were starting to spend a lot more time in prepar@@ ation .
what it does is a very simple idea of taking -- 80 to 90 percent of the co2 produced in manhattan is building related -- we take , just like a commercial greenhouse , we take the co2 from the building -- co2-@@ en@@ ri@@ ched air -- we force it through the urban agriculture facili@@ ty , and then we res@@ upp@@ ly oxy@@ gen-@@ en@@ ri@@ ched air .
if people are approach@@ ing these che@@ ck@@ points and the military person@@ nel there are uns@@ ure whether this person &apos;s ho@@ sti@@ le or not .
he &apos;s the guy that kind of discovered me , and kind of got me going in digital media .
and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was s@@ ars . and s@@ ars is the pande@@ mic that did not occu@@ r .
here my friend j@@ essi@@ ca sent me a picture of her head l@@ ac@@ er@@ ation so i can save her a trip to the emer@@ gency room -- i can do some diagno@@ stics that way .
they made another machine to produce those people : the school .
and his great friend speed went to his side and said , &quot; lincoln , you must r@@ ally or you will die . &quot;
maybe pulling bits off ? i &apos;m not asking about that .
and the answer is , yes , we can , and we did .
we came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting .
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
if you think about it , this imper@@ ative is kind of the defin@@ ing charac@@ teri@@ stic of our species , isn &apos;t it ?
yes . but we need mechan@@ i@@ zation .
he says something &apos;s just . she says something else is just .
and so with this le@@ go k@@ it , we have the diversity required for complex information stor@@ age without dna .
rob rei@@ d : the $ 8 billion ipod
it &apos;s a technique where they can mix materials together and m@@ old any shape that they like , and put in the material properties .
and then the most complex are the solid organs .
another one was an inter@@ active project where , when you moved the mouse over the letters of &quot; happy mom day , &quot; it re@@ ve@@ als a special happy mother &apos;s day s@@ log@@ an .
one was -- never be late . never be late .
and what they do is step , very co@@ ar@@ sely at first , and then very fin@@ ely after@@ ward .
we know it takes a lot to make it happen , and we know the direction the world is going in .
some people say , &quot; well , that &apos;s just because those m@@ ba types are gre@@ edy . &quot;
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
what &apos;s the kind of technique ?
what do organi@@ zed religions do ?
if it bur@@ ns in a forest fire , it &apos;s going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well .
i think the biggest problem that we face is our own will@@ ing@@ ness to share our data .
so in the process , i start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
and how we man@@ age our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
third , that tho@@ u sh@@ all have re@@ ver@@ ence .
scre@@ ening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the gro@@ cer@@ y store in a hum@@ mer .
the ene@@ my didn &apos;t break a swe@@ at doing it .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize fail@@ ure .
en@@ han@@ cing the public good becomes a pri@@ mary obje@@ ctive .
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
and language is actually a problem here .
richard bar@@ ani@@ u@@ k : this costs 22 dollars to the student .
and if it comes out at 13@@ 8 dollars , so what ?
well , you and i know when you pro@@ hi@@ bit fail@@ ure , you kill innovation .
and the response was , &quot; such a thing is to be se@@ tt@@ led by te@@ stim@@ ony .
we &apos;re just the no@@ des in the network .
this aspi@@ ration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enor@@ m@@ ously powerful one .
and he wrote to the acade@@ mi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
what we did is , we took tissue culture cells and infe@@ cted them with aden@@ o@@ virus , and you can see this little yellow bar@@ code next to aden@@ o@@ virus .
multi@@ p@@ ly 22 times 4@@ 7 , make sure you get 1,@@ 0@@ 34 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,@@ 0@@ 34 ? 1,@@ 0@@ 34 ?
in this arti@@ stic and scientific installation , bio@@ gener@@ ative algorith@@ ms are helping us to understand self-@@ generation and growth : very important for simulation in the nan@@ os@@ cal@@ ed sci@@ ences .
my first personal experience with studying the micro@@ bes on the human body actually came from a talk that i gave , right around the corner from here at geor@@ ge@@ town .
basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . you find some interesting content , say a tedtalk , sub@@ mit it to re@@ dd@@ it , and the community of your pe@@ ers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos;t .
it &apos;s very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for granted .
she said , &quot; i have defen@@ ded more than a hundred people , and i &apos;ve never had to do any investig@@ ation , because they all come with con@@ f@@ essi@@ ons . &quot;
some artic@@ les even went as far as to say that skelet@@ al muscle tissue is resist@@ ant to cancer , and fur@@ ther@@ more , not only to cancer , but of meta@@ st@@ ases going to skelet@@ al muscle .
kis@@ met : scientist : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
and i kind of ru@@ min@@ ated on that for a couple of days .
vaccin@@ es that are bro@@ ad spectrum .
i think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
in many the@@ me par@@ ks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
and between this muscle , they found nervous tissues , a lot of nervous tissues , which pen@@ et@@ rate actually the muscle -- pen@@ et@@ rate the sub@@ mu@@ cos@@ a , where you have all the elements for the imm@@ une system .
in fact , inspired employees quite often help make si@@ z@@ able prof@@ its , right ?
i think of the difference of google video versus youtube .
this is the most complex .
contr@@ ary to widely held assu@@ mp@@ tions , an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on action provi@@ des a special ur@@ gency to thinking .
his name was s@@ ven ar@@ r@@ hen@@ i@@ us . he was swe@@ dish , and he said , if you double the co2 level in the atmosphere , which he thought might -- this is in 19@@ 00 -- the temperature ought to go up about 5@@ .@@ 5 degrees , he calcul@@ ated .
but people pre@@ vail@@ ed on us , and we got together , and it &apos;s been transforma@@ tive in what i do , absolutely transforma@@ tive .
some people have called a cy@@ ber@@ war what may actually be just a sp@@ y operation -- and obviously , a quite mis@@ hand@@ led one .
and of course , that expansion was deeply imp@@ licated in the crisis .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
i sometimes see when i &apos;m speaking to a con@@ gre@@ g@@ ation of religi@@ ous people a sort of mu@@ tin@@ ous expression crossing their fac@@ es because people often want to be right instead .
similar fig@@ ures ob@@ tain@@ ed for belief in personal im@@ mortality .
it &apos;s incredibly pain@@ ful .
so just as a curi@@ osity , where did you land when you fle@@ w over the grand c@@ any@@ on ?
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
what would happen if we could generate power from our win@@ dow@@ pan@@ es ? in this moving talk , entrepreneur ju@@ stin hall@@ -@@ ti@@ pping shows the materials that could make that possible , and how questi@@ oning our notion of &apos; normal &apos; can lead to extraordinary break@@ through@@ s .
it &apos;s poin@@ t@@ less . &quot;
since there is no real re@@ tribu@@ tion possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes appar@@ ent that the whole notion of this mu@@ tu@@ ally assu@@ red destruction would not work .
that &apos;d be the second thing .
and though she had been part of building a liber@@ al party , a political party that was focused on diversity and toler@@ ance , about three months before the genocide , she swi@@ tched par@@ ties and jo@@ ined the extrem@@ ist party , hu@@ t@@ u power , and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regi@@ me and was known for in@@ c@@ iting men to kill faster and stop be@@ having like women .
one : cele@@ bra@@ te moral ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ars .
i think the most promis@@ ing way is to go for biom@@ ar@@ kers .
it &apos;s true .
the point that we have been stres@@ sing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be econom@@ ically poor , but they &apos;re not poor in the mind .
this is an amazing group of people who are doing so much , using so much of their talent , their brilli@@ ance , their energy , their money , to make the world a better place , to fight -- to fight wr@@ on@@ gs , to solve problems .
and it &apos;s important to make a dist@@ in@@ ction , because if the news is anything to go by , 40 percent of americans can &apos;t -- either can &apos;t afford health insur@@ ance or have the most in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate health insur@@ ance , and have a president who , despite the pro@@ test of millions of his citizens -- even his own congress -- contin@@ ues to pros@@ ec@@ ute a sen@@ sel@@ ess war .
and the number of us who live outside the old nation@@ -@@ state cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies is increasing so quickly , by 6@@ 4 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
out in inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , those three pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ it@@ es for the op@@ en-@@ ended creation of knowledge are at their lo@@ west possible supply .
okay . now we &apos;re going to switch back into the au@@ ras@@ ma app@@ li@@ cation , and what tam@@ ara &apos;s going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my bad@@ ge , so that i can remember it forever .
so hundreds of others , of n@@ gos , of forest workers &apos; uni@@ ons , and of businesses , have helped create the forest ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship coun@@ ci@@ l , which sets standards for fore@@ stry and then che@@ cks the fore@@ stry &apos;s good on the ground .
fort@@ y-@@ five years after gei@@ ger , health leads has to rein@@ vent the prescri@@ ption for basic resources .
i figured it out .
it means that we exten@@ ded co@@ operation across national boun@@ dar@@ ies ; we made the world more cooper@@ ative .
canada &apos;s currently led by a party that most can@@ adi@@ ans didn &apos;t actually want .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .

google answers is something we started , which is really cool , which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there &apos;s a po@@ ol of researchers that go out and research it for you , and it &apos;s guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed and all that , and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself .
you know , we just cele@@ br@@ ated , this year , our general elections , the biggest exercise in democratic fran@@ ch@@ ise in human history .
now obviously , as ma@@ d@@ die &apos;s chemi@@ stry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to ge@@ ek out about this kind of ridiculous demon@@ stration that we did in class .
so you don &apos;t need to go into the recent call@@ s list , so if you &apos;re trying to get through to somebody , just hit the call butt@@ on again .
and because of this left wei@@ ghting , the average is actually here , way to the left .
and the human@@ i@@ ties and arts programs in the universi@@ ties , which by many meas@@ ures , indeed are in de@@ cl@@ ine .
and it &apos;s called &quot; see@@ ds of the future are planted today . &quot;
i think this is the big mistake .
in the past it would take you weeks , if not months , to identi@@ fy how ir@@ ani@@ an activi@@ sts connect to each other .
to give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide .
but univer@@ s@@ ally , these people that had been through this had a@@ sto@@ unding at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them .
and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
kb : no ?
i don &apos;t have it . but if you need a toilet fixed or , you know , some shel@@ ving , i got@@ ta wait six months for an ap@@ poin@@ tment with someone who dri@@ ves a much ni@@ cer car than me .
it needs a pro@@ found atten@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and a patient waiting , a con@@ tem@@ pla@@ tive at@@ titude and a gener@@ osity and open@@ ness to those whose experience is different from my own .
we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
thank you , thank you .
as i said , all the bal@@ con@@ ies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
the re@@ action on the streets was violent con@@ fron@@ tation .
so we had a big problem : we didn &apos;t know how we were going to do this .
and you can think of it in terms of a gam@@ e-@@ theor@@ e@@ tic pa@@ yo@@ ff matrix .
that clou@@ dy white mass that you see is the re@@ curr@@ ence of the tumor .
sir david atten@@ bor@@ ough , he &apos;s come over .

i &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions -- &quot; when did the world begin ? how will it end ? &quot; — to nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
you go from drug formul@@ ation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you guys to get married pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely just so you can do it while dad &apos;s still alive . &quot;
and look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference .
d@@ h : that &apos;s right .
e : i &apos;m special .
it seems to me that this can &apos;t be a very expensive solution , and it &apos;s got to work better than what we already have .
so i go down to the ward and see j@@ im , and his skin his trans@@ lu@@ cent like this .
in case anyone out there is looking for a job in a re@@ cession , that &apos;s the page to go to .

i got@@ ta get back out my base@@ ball ability here .
what should we be doing ? what &apos;s the answer ?
and these mos@@ ses , gener@@ ated by de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing , are like pe@@ at mos@@ s in your garden .
so you can wait for the second coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million .
and i explained to him quickly , i would train psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors , i would open centers , and i explained to him why .
not as the my@@ th is . and that inclu@@ des all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country .
that just taking a field and ban@@ ging all these things out isn &apos;t necessarily the most efficient way that they could work .
it &apos;s hand@@ s-@@ on , it &apos;s in-@@ your@@ -@@ face , it requ@@ ires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .

now let &apos;s imagine that each single root ap@@ ex is working in network with all the others .
well , this one female came up to him .
i think -- how can this possibly be ?
and this is the opening day at the library of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the new library of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , in egyp@@ t .
those are things that are different for each m@@ .@@ s. patient .
but they just miss .
well , that &apos;s not exactly the story , because the problem was that par@@ li@@ am@@ ent del@@ a@@ yed and del@@ a@@ yed rele@@ asing that data , and then they tried to re@@ tros@@ pe@@ c@@ tively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them .
i learned a huge amount from henry .
we have agen@@ cy .
turn it from that into some answer in a mathema@@ tical form .
and so here was this lesson again -- lea@@ der@@ ship matters .
so my mother was a little offen@@ ded . she turned to her and she said , &quot; are you ki@@ d@@ ding ? they have the greatest life together .
can you just en@@ comp@@ ass these people too ?
and we could be nu@@ d@@ ging kids like will off of the path that we &apos;re on .
we want to clu@@ tch , and we are left instead clu@@ t@@ ching at a series of static moments .
but on the outside it does scre@@ am out at you a bit .
well , the third and final wish is some@@ what -- unfortunately , it &apos;s much more complicated because it involves lawyers .
this is tom cru@@ ise arri@@ ving at the &quot; mission : impossible i@@ ii &quot; pre@@ mi@@ ere .
i &apos;d like to pause my tedtalk for about 10 seconds right now , because you don &apos;t get many opportunities in life to do something like this , and my parents are sitting in the front row .
out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
and right now , we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease . it &apos;s corruption .
geor@@ ge@@ tte mul@@ hei@@ r : the tragedy of or@@ ph@@ an@@ ages
they were gone in an inst@@ ant .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
you never know when you might need it .
and that is the problem with these u@@ top@@ ian ideas , that they are u@@ top@@ ian .
and so we need to en@@ sure that these people who are living with hiv or at greatest risk of hiv have access to legal services and they have equal access to the cour@@ ts .
up at the top of the axis , &quot; build the bomb . &quot;
it &apos;s used to change the scene .
but we did not evol@@ ve to have the same brain .
any of those can be opened up .
and i think back .
in fact , a me@@ mber of society is only truly dead when the exten@@ ded family can agree upon and mar@@ sha@@ l the resources necessary to hold a fun@@ er@@ al cer@@ em@@ ony that is consi@@ dered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the de@@ c@@ eas@@ ed .
there were several other activi@@ ties .
my parents got me a tu@@ tor in french , and i still su@@ ck in french .
this picture shows that the revolution for education .
this sugge@@ sts that whatever is beautiful and moving , whatever gives us a new way to see , cannot be communic@@ ated to those who speak a different language .
you all know remote contro@@ ls have an in@@ fr@@ ared led -- basically you switch on the led , and if it &apos;s off , you switch it off .
dan@@ cers have created a whole global labor@@ atory online for dance , where kids in japan are taking moves from a youtube video created in de@@ tro@@ it , building on it within days and rele@@ asing a new video , while te@@ en@@ a@@ gers in california are taking the japanese video and re@@ mix@@ ing it with a phil@@ ly fla@@ ir to create a whole new dance sty@@ le in itself .
in fact , there &apos;s about 12 electr@@ ons can all be flo@@ wing this way .
and what really dri@@ ves me is a vision of the future that i think we all share .
in the winn@@ ing life edi@@ ted sche@@ me in a ren@@ der here , we com@@ bine a moving wall with transfor@@ mer fur@@ ni@@ ture to get a lot out of the space .
you know , in the 18@@ th century in the u.k. , the greatest pre@@ acher , greatest religi@@ ous pre@@ acher , was a man called john wes@@ ley , who went up and down this country deli@@ ver@@ ing ser@@ mon@@ s , ad@@ vising people how they could live .
we are trying to re@@ store that balance of nature that we have up@@ set .
so even with parti@@ al subsi@@ dy , three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net , and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets , you lose the health imm@@ unity , that &apos;s not great .
i was going in the tun@@ n@@ els of paris , on the ro@@ o@@ ft@@ ops with my friends .
but deci@@ pher@@ ing the script is a very challenging task .
so far it &apos;s meant la@@ yo@@ ffs , increas@@ ed class si@@ zes .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is , again , one of the most state-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art tex@@ tile m@@ ills .
the gar@@ age on the right -- the gray structure -- will be tor@@ n down , finally , and several small class@@ ro@@ oms will be placed along this a@@ venue that we &apos;ve created , this cam@@ pus .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ tened about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
well , other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs , and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of , we could do the math .
we don &apos;t even find dead bodies .
it was the best month of my life , because i just sat back and i read books and wat@@ ched movies .
it &apos;s fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together .
it was made out of res@@ in , which wasn &apos;t a common material for movie pro@@ ps about the time the movie was made .
is microsoft a great big anth@@ ill ?
so i &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
and since i don &apos;t like to travel alone , they also invi@@ ted my daughter , son@@ -@@ in-@@ law and grand@@ daughter , so we had a lovely trip to see russi@@ a today , which is not a very pleas@@ ant and happy view .
she needs to give it to us .
we care what happens in &quot; ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ se now . &quot;
how do we tell these robo@@ tic arms what to do ?
and this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have set@@ bac@@ ks and then aspi@@ ra@@ tions .
and it &apos;s all part of the same design .
when we were ancient man — — millions of years ago , and we suddenly felt threat@@ ened by a pre@@ dat@@ or , okay ? — — we would — thank you . i dre@@ w these myself .
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to see them ra@@ cing for the first time at da@@ y@@ ton@@ a next month , because i feel the need for speed . &quot;
and why was i fascinated ?
but the good news is they are out there .
all of a sudden , a very large per@@ cent@@ age of the traffic on the whole internet , including a lot of the traffic between u.s. military install@@ ations , started getting re-@@ rou@@ ted through china .
they &apos;ll come back home and get dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled , and it will result in diffic@@ ul@@ ties we don &apos;t want .
so if you &apos;re sitting there stres@@ sing about large ca@@ p versus small ca@@ p , or company a versus company b , or should you buy the su@@ bar@@ u or the pri@@ us , you know what , let it go .
so i can put some lines on ; it doesn &apos;t help .
it &apos;s something that people don &apos;t do very well .
he built the capital over there .
in fact , they lied about their hei@@ ght about nine ten@@ ths of an in@@ ch , what we say in the lab as &quot; strong ro@@ unding up . &quot;
it means nothing at all .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- immen@@ se numbers .
abo@@ ard mission blue , scientist gre@@ g stone tells the story of how he helped the re@@ public of kiribati create an enormous protected area in the middle of the pac@@ i@@ fic -- prote@@ cting fish , se@@ ali@@ fe and the island nation itself .
she &apos;s eating him .
that &apos;s what we need to do for our personal health model .
you just take a seat over here for a second .
and the way that i &apos;ve been doing it has been multi@@ fac@@ et@@ ed .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
anyway , so this is also a really enjo@@ y@@ able role .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
i &apos;m here to give you your recom@@ men@@ ded di@@ et@@ ary allo@@ wan@@ ce of po@@ etry .
the mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s model sc@@ ales .
now don &apos;t run away . you had something down by your pants po@@ cket .
this whole system gener@@ ates a huge surface to allow more enz@@ y@@ mes to attack the re@@ ma@@ ining oil .
and it &apos;s what buddh@@ ist fis@@ her@@ men say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
so imagine how something like this could help revolution@@ ize your field of work .
and then i learned how to pur@@ ge .
the way this showed up in the text@@ book , it looked like this : &quot; bac@@ teri@@ op@@ ha@@ ge repli@@ cation is initi@@ ated through the introdu@@ ction of viral nu@@ c@@ lei@@ c ac@@ id into a bac@@ teri@@ um . &quot;
questions can be windows to great instru@@ ction , but not the other way around .
did design do this ?
kids used to say , &quot; she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to er@@ ase , but couldn &apos;t quite get the job done . &quot;
and especially as sub@@ ur@@ bia is becoming less cen@@ tered on the family , the family hou@@ se@@ holds , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
even my books on children have cute , fu@@ zzy animals .
and now we get to the cru@@ x of the dis@@ agre@@ ement between liber@@ als and conserva@@ tives .
these are little bits of individual gra@@ in of poll@@ en there and there , and here is a -- what you see as one little yellow do@@ t of poll@@ en , when you look in a micros@@ cope , it &apos;s actually made of thousands of little gra@@ ins of poll@@ en .
they &apos;re sitting in a room with pot@@ a@@ to chips in front of them .
it turns out he doesn &apos;t buy any of his equipment .
this is an inher@@ ited dis@@ order .
when i knew i was going to come to speak to you , i thought , &quot; i got@@ ta call my mother . &quot;
now , we can spe@@ cul@@ ate and philosop@@ hi@@ ze this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
and she wanted to study the tal@@ mu@@ d .

there &apos;s basically a giant path@@ way in the sky between london and new york .
but they had not had any time to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate any bel@@ ong@@ ings .

i interview and do portra@@ its .
and i believe we count as a threshold in this great story .
and all forms of intervention need support , the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth , the kinds of institutions that increase produ@@ ctivity .
so , the lesson from physics is that entrop@@ y will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental law .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simpl@@ est explanation for our remarkable cogni@@ tive abilities .
the european union , same thing .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
like if i smo@@ ked , i &apos;d probably just smo@@ ke instead .
and then over the summer , they &apos;re off@@ ered a summer job .
as a dan@@ cer , i know the nine ras@@ as or the na@@ v@@ ar@@ as@@ as : an@@ ger , val@@ or , dis@@ g@@ ust , humor and fear .
human beings have been campa@@ ig@@ ning against in@@ equ@@ ality and poverty for 3,000 years . but this journey is acceler@@ ating . bono &quot; embra@@ ces his inner ner@@ d &quot; and shares inspi@@ ring data that shows the end of poverty is in sight … if we can har@@ ness the moment@@ um .
so i &apos;m going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambi@@ ent and you can see what happens .
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
if the children of the u@@ ganda need another dance partner , einstein could sure fit the bill , because she lo@@ ves to dance .
it &apos;s 14 hours 58 minutes . who car@@ es the last two minutes ? &quot;
there &apos;s only one obvious conclu@@ sion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even santa cl@@ aus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ment , this hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction by santa , who was j@@ ol@@ ly -- but , let &apos;s face it , he was also very jud@@ g@@ mental .
in the second world war , too , the exist@@ ence of solar radiation was demon@@ str@@ ated by studies of inter@@ ference that was dete@@ cted by the ra@@ dar stations of great britain .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
and this is our be@@ ast of bur@@ den -- this is a computer tomo@@ graphy machine , a ct machine .
so , i am very interested , from the beginning , that how -- how our knowledge about everyday objects and gest@@ ures , and how we use these objects , can be lever@@ a@@ ged to our interactions with the digital world .
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections .
you have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
what is multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ t@@ asking ? it &apos;s the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they &apos;re doing search on the web at the same time as they &apos;re ch@@ at@@ ting on facebook with their friends .
&quot; no , hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; he went on , &quot; it &apos;s only three hours away by car , and it &apos;s not very expensive , and it &apos;s probably not like anywhere you &apos;ve sta@@ yed before . &quot;
i -- i like -- there was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which i did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken contro@@ versi@@ al stands or discovered dis@@ qui@@ eting fin@@ dings in the behavi@@ or@@ al sci@@ ences .
this simulation was run on 1@@ ,000 process@@ ors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
a space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner work@@ ings of a density .
i be@@ t , in a couple of years , that phr@@ ases like &quot; co@@ working &quot; and &quot; cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing &quot; and &quot; time ban@@ ks &quot; are going to become a part of everyday vern@@ ac@@ ular .
i want to know how i impact them .
which , it turned out , for this black gang , was not one of the more brilliant financial en@@ dea@@ vors that they under@@ took .
so when we wanted to create our open government policy , what did we do ? we wanted , naturally , to ask public sector employees how we should open up government .
there was much i wi@@ shed to say to abed .
if you take into account 80 percent of all americans were born after world war ii , this is essentially our depression .
okay ? oil d@@ rop@@ let forms through self-@@ assem@@ bly , has a chemical met@@ ab@@ oli@@ sm inside so it can use energy , and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment .
i then pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ded to tell the patient , once the patient was dres@@ sed , the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions , which is , &quot; this is not in your head .
if god is a by@@ stan@@ der , ob@@ ser@@ ving but not involved , then god may well exist , but we don &apos;t want to know about him .
maybe we evolved as a hun@@ ting pack animal .
nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , ma@@ sters of the cover up .
yeah , from my own experience . so i &apos;m -- actually , i mean , here we have some artists that are a bit more struc@@ tured . it &apos;s not too bad .
and we switch this to the king .
i thought i would read po@@ em@@ s i have that rel@@ ate to the subject of you@@ th and age .
now , it may sound as though i &apos;m about to pre@@ ach a@@ thei@@ sm , and i want to reas@@ sure you that that &apos;s not what i &apos;m going to do .
and to inter@@ face with it , with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do , giving them p@@ ig@@ ment and paint just like an artist , it &apos;s a good ally .
and these big tears fell down her face , but she never lif@@ ted her hands to move them .
60 to 80 percent of the work@@ force in china is women in the co@@ ast@@ al part of the country , whereas in india , it &apos;s all men .
but i got some medicine here that just might shake things lo@@ ose .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
they were doing fine .
i built a web inter@@ face for vie@@ wing &quot; the whale h@@ unt &quot; that attemp@@ ts to do just this .
fr@@ ans de wa@@ al : moral behavior in animals
as you walk towards the ever@@ -@@ open threshold , you disappear , both to your@@ selves and to others .
and it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
em : zero . pay zero up front .
but the zep@@ pe@@ lin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
i also search@@ ed on this story for the el@@ u@@ sive great ham@@ mer@@ head , an animal that really hadn &apos;t been photograph@@ ed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .
also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of earth .
now , i &apos;m going to ask you all a very personal question .
angel@@ ine came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any cri@@ teria that we had .
our investment in trying to prevent pande@@ mic flu is aff@@ ecting the distribution of possible outcomes .
very lucky .
maybe this particular tri@@ al yi@@ el@@ ded exciting results .
this is my grand@@ father .
and on top of that , now we have a whole ple@@ th@@ ora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for min@@ ing camp@@ s , mobile you@@ th ho@@ st@@ els , right down to the world c@@ up and the olymp@@ ics .
and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way -- no char@@ ity , no p@@ ity .
&quot; i know , &quot; i said . &quot; i &apos;m aware of this cust@@ om .
it wasn &apos;t the end ; it was the beginning . what am i going to do ?
y@@ ay !
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model -- different amounts of u@@ v hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stor@@ es of ni@@ tri@@ c oxide -- the ni@@ tr@@ ates , ni@@ tri@@ tes , ni@@ tros@@ o@@ thi@@ ols in the skin -- c@@ leave to rele@@ ase no .
and surrounding him are usually three other children , who are ad@@ vising him on what they should do .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fing@@ ers had fro@@ zen and exp@@ anded .
what could be easier , more fil@@ ling or health@@ ier for your family than bro@@ iling a steak ?
you know , they say , never play with your food -- but i always play with things .
you will feel loved and appreci@@ ated like never before and re@@ connect with friends and ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ tan@@ ces you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
do i car@@ ve a message in the s@@ now ?
but he &apos;s not stupid . he knows it &apos;s not real .
we &apos;re also re@@ turning to an ancient form of mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality .
other people , like david pack@@ ard and jul@@ ie pack@@ ard , who were instru@@ mental in producing the monterey bay aqu@@ arium to lo@@ ck into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
and then i &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
talk more about it .
we walked 120 kilome@@ ters until we reach@@ ed sud@@ an .
so all of those pengu@@ ins had to have the oil me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously cle@@ an@@ ed from their bodies .
they cannot wait . the others , of course , wait .
you vaccin@@ ate all the children in an area .
we could be provi@@ ding early childhood care for econom@@ ically dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged and otherwise trou@@ bled kids , and we could be doing it for free .
now , when you think of glass , you might think of col@@ or@@ ful ch@@ ih@@ u@@ ly designs or maybe itali@@ an v@@ ases , but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the real@@ m of bro@@ ken@@ -@@ he@@ ar@@ ted s@@ na@@ kes and bac@@ on boys , who you can see has meat vision .
for instance , like , when you &apos;re on an air@@ plane , they show the movie , you get to watch it for free ; when you want to hear the sound , you pay .
this is a picture of me from a very aw@@ k@@ ward stage in my life .
and so this is a very serious problem . where is it coming from ?
and he got together with the camp@@ bell &apos;s sou@@ p kit@@ chen , and he made 45 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of spa@@ gh@@ ett@@ i sauce . and he vari@@ ed them according to every con@@ cei@@ vable way that you can v@@ ary to@@ ma@@ to sauce : by swe@@ et@@ ness , by level of gar@@ lic , by tar@@ t@@ ness , by sour@@ ness , by to@@ ma@@ to@@ e@@ y-@@ ness , by visible soli@@ ds -- my favorite term in the spa@@ gh@@ ett@@ i sauce business .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
you can &apos;t ask someone to do that on your be@@ half .
he said , &quot; i was so moved .
so some people think that these models sound well and good , but ask , &quot; well , are these really as good as the rat ? &quot;
so , nasa , at some point , did an experiment where they took images of mars that they were m@@ apping , and they said , instead of having three or four fully trained ph@@ .@@ d.@@ s doing this all the time , let &apos;s break it up into small components , put it up on the web , and see if people , using a very simple inter@@ face , will actually spend five minutes here , 10 minutes there , cli@@ cking . after six months , 8@@ 5,000 people used this to generate m@@ apping at a faster rate than the images were coming in , which was , quote , &quot; prac@@ tically indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from the mark@@ ings of a ful@@ l@@ y-@@ trained ph@@ .@@ d. , &quot; once you showed it to a number of people and compu@@ ted the average .
and i want to tell you a great story . when a@@ gn@@ es first started fighting to stop female gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation in her community , she had become an out@@ cast , and she was ex@@ iled and she was s@@ lan@@ dered , and the whole community turned against her .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
this is an a@@ eri@@ al picture we did this year .
it did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that er@@ otic no@@ vels were a good idea .
we had mar@@ gin@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders .
if we look around us , much of what surro@@ unds us started life as various rocks and s@@ lu@@ dge buried in the ground in various places in the world .
but now one final thing .
it &apos;s as though mexico and canada were ho@@ sti@@ le neigh@@ b@@ ors to the united states , which they &apos;re not .
my parents were both ele@@ cted to the first par@@ li@@ am@@ ent , al@@ ong@@ side nel@@ son and winn@@ ie mand@@ ela . they were the only other couple .
and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle .
and that &apos;s a picture that every neuro@@ physi@@ olog@@ ist knows .
i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful , bright , happy little child , who now appe@@ ared to be very with@@ dra@@ wn , being ens@@ la@@ ved by this family .
the first one is in the crisis itself .
so that &apos;s why i ch@@ ose to use paper .
that &apos;s better . and of course , in princi@@ ple , you could do three , four or more , but it starts to get very difficult .
so at the time of being invi@@ ted down there , we were based in san fran@@ cis@@ co , and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 200@@ 9 , spending about half our time in ber@@ t@@ ie coun@@ ty .
they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
we have all these lessons in front of us , but we don &apos;t take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tu@@ tor .
one hundred thousand po@@ sters have been prin@@ ted this year .
and so we were ro@@ wing , and one of these western gre@@ bes came along .
so thank you for your attention .
i guess , you know , he was the big hero .
then , even a one per@@ cent@@ age point redu@@ ction in the extin@@ ction risk could be equi@@ valent to this astronom@@ ical number -- 10 to the power of 3@@ 2 .
one night , she had a dream .
as you may know , the entire world oper@@ ates on a universal law : entrop@@ y , the second law of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics .
at camp di@@ va , my non-@@ profit organization , we have these types of conver@@ sa@@ tions all the time as a way to help girls of african des@@ cent pre@@ p@@ are for their pas@@ sage into wom@@ an@@ hood .
i do want to test this question we &apos;re all interested in : does extin@@ ction have to be forever ?
there &apos;s three particular things that i &apos;ve done , and i &apos;ll just describe those first , and then talk about some of my work .
the ac@@ ac@@ ia trees are of a very low value but we need them to re@@ store the micro@@ -@@ climate , to protect the soil and to shake out the gras@@ ses .
and we discovered that it &apos;s a very good thing that , when you go home with something that &apos;s been broken , you &apos;ve actually learned a lot more than when you managed to ti@@ ck off all of your test obje@@ c@@ tives the first time through .
if you go out to the corner right at the main inter@@ section right in front of this conference center , you &apos;ll see an inter@@ section with four b@@ lan@@ k walls on every corner .
and i made these self-@@ ne@@ g@@ ating choices so refle@@ xi@@ v@@ ely , that i wasn &apos;t even aware that i was making them .
and symbo@@ lic@@ ally , the colors of the inter@@ ior are green and yellow .
and in phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , you have phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a che@@ es@@ e@@ steak roll , which looks like an eg@@ g roll on the outside , but a che@@ es@@ e@@ steak on the inside .
what is the wall mostly made of ? atom@@ s .
i travel@@ ed around the world , entered different cultures , wrote a series of books about my tra@@ vels , including &quot; walking the bi@@ ble . &quot;
this is at 17@@ ,000 feet .
da@@ y@@ light , you could call it , transpar@@ ency .
the ba@@ -@@ il@@ a built this village about 400 meters in diam@@ eter .
but that is more than simply good er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , putting the butt@@ ons in the right place .
science is not argu@@ ing about that .
and you know about the internet@@ -@@ based self-@@ organi@@ zing systems .
so are we ready ?
the s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eur is there , and we also read from sun t@@ zu &apos;s &quot; the art of war . &quot;
and we have our own li@@ p bal@@ m , and we have a leading brand .
and the fac@@ ade of the par@@ king , we wanted to make the par@@ king naturally v@@ enti@@ l@@ ated , so we needed to perfor@@ ate it .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
thank you .
it was magic heal@@ ers and aro@@ matic o@@ ils .
she &apos;s related to me . somebody will be very gl@@ ad that she &apos;s up here on the screen .
and if you put them together in different combin@@ ations -- just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is prin@@ ted -- and put them under certain forces , which is or@@ bit@@ ing them or pas@@ sing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appe@@ aring .
but also , ben ali , tun@@ isi@@ an president , didn &apos;t follow the second rule .
so he &apos;s developing strategi@@ es so the vehicle can communicate with pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans , so -- so the head@@ lights are eye@@ balls , the pu@@ p@@ ils can di@@ late , we have dire@@ c@@ tional audi@@ o , we can throw sound directly at people .
and that would provide the community &apos;s food supply for a long time .
but what i &apos;ve been doing -- when i was about 14 , i grew in my uncle &apos;s house .
and , again , all of it pro@@ mot@@ ing transpar@@ ency .
so , i kid you not , the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was , &quot; how do you feel about being poor and black in america ? &quot;
he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s coming .
this ar@@ c of development gives us un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented and extremely valu@@ able information about how the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of vision gets set up .
not by much , as an individual level , but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population .
and in fact , without insects , we would not be here in this room , because if the insects die out , we will soon die out as well .
this is em@@ ble@@ matic of it -- this is wing din@@ ing , re@@ calling those bal@@ my summer days somewhere over fr@@ ance in the 20@@ s , din@@ ing on the wing of a plane . you can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s he@@ m@@ ing@@ way reading some pa@@ ges from his new novel to fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald and ford ma@@ dox ford until the sli@@ p@@ stream blo@@ ws him away .
if i showed you this dete@@ ctor , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the dete@@ ctor go would be to put a block on top of the dete@@ ctor .
actually , i once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of &quot; king le@@ ar , &quot; and i felt really rob@@ bed , because by the time the actor started being king le@@ ar , he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see .
and congress did something .
you need to have access to some family plan@@ ning .
and this was very consi@@ stent .
well not@@ ation not only passed the music on , not@@ ating and en@@ co@@ ding the music changed its pri@@ orities entirely , because it en@@ ab@@ led the musi@@ cians to imagine music on a much va@@ ster scale .
this is an ant that stor@@ es its colleagues &apos; hon@@ ey in its ab@@ d@@ omen .
now , one way of de@@ aling with this problem is by de@@ terr@@ ence .
a@@ o : or another one ? how about in g min@@ or ?
very low no@@ vel@@ ty standard , anybody can regi@@ ster anything .
we know that there was a len@@ ape se@@ tt@@ lement down here by the collect pon@@ d .
i also had my first taste of cultural ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
we set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months ren@@ ov@@ ating this place .
but we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s g@@ dp in 1960 , around the time of in@@ dependence for many african states .
from the first days and weeks of life , bab@@ ies pre@@ fer to hear human sounds rather than just they pre@@ fer to look at people rather than at things , and even as they &apos;re looking at people , they look at people &apos;s eyes , because the eye is the window to the other person &apos;s experi@@ ences , so much so that they even pre@@ fer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away .
we sent two or@@ bi@@ ters and two lan@@ ders in the summer of 197@@ 6 .
so , you know , sustain@@ ability , small planet .
it was so simple , in fact , that i suspe@@ ct a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calcul@@ us , could understand what he wrote down .
you &apos;re changing the micro@@ structure of your brain as you go along .
and at one point , one of the girls who was sitting at his table , seeing what he was doing , le@@ an@@ ed over and said to him , &quot; that &apos;s terrible . that doesn &apos;t look anything like a hor@@ se . &quot;
this isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple demon@@ stration .
why ? well , there are no experts .
we &apos;re starting to rein@@ vent community ourselves , and we &apos;ve done it all without a fli@@ pping strategy docum@@ ent .
that is the sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce system .
it was amazing .
but it could be very different , because having access to those state-@@ bac@@ ked facili@@ ties could incenti@@ vi@@ ze this con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um to seriously invest in the service .
one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the united states .
cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia brea@@ ze@@ al : so kis@@ met inter@@ ac@@ ted with people like kind of a non-@@ verb@@ al child or pre@@ -@@ verb@@ al child , which i assu@@ me was fit@@ ting because it was really the first of its kind .
the reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dri@@ es up .
so , as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry .
politicians also need to learn , occas@@ ion@@ ally , to say that certain things that vot@@ ers want , certain things that vot@@ ers have been promised , may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver .
we want to say , &quot; this is just the way it is .
that didn &apos;t seem to prevent the doctors from being fran@@ tically bus@@ y in their days , as he explained .
let &apos;s start with the definition of schi@@ zophren@@ ia .
we didn &apos;t have a fra@@ me@@ work .
we &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explo@@ de again if you don &apos;t s@@ nu@@ ff it out completely .
and we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very sh@@ y , sensitive and sweet creatures .
or just try this one on for size .
that &apos;s the con@@ tra@@ ct where ar@@ pa gave the first million dollars to get this thing started .
i &apos;m trying to find not the metaph@@ ors , but , rather , the points in common -- the common grip@@ es , the common issues , the common pre@@ occu@@ pa@@ tions -- and i think that it will en@@ able us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instru@@ ction , as a direction rather than a prescri@@ ption of form .
having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
there are a few people who don &apos;t like shrimp , but shrimp , or cr@@ ab@@ s , or cra@@ y@@ fish , are very clos@@ ely related .
and i sat there in the studio watching these women cl@@ apping their hands -- beautiful rhyth@@ ms -- as these little fair@@ y pi@@ x@@ ies were dan@@ cing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors .
this affected my entire body .
and the second thing i learned was that i knew , with pro@@ found certain@@ ty , that this is exactly what i was going to do for the rest of my life .
la@@ dies and gent@@ le@@ men , i have de@@ vot@@ ed the past 25 years of my life to desig@@ ning books .
so , we &apos;ve got to re@@ build the world institutions .
so , i think that &apos;s good .
it was fe@@ bru@@ ary 3@@ rd , 2008 .
we &apos;re lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
there are few phr@@ ases that pack a more concent@@ rated d@@ ose of subject and symbol than the perfect pun@@ ch@@ line .
you are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the community you serve .
but that &apos;s okay .
or the man who deci@@ des that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say good@@ b@@ ye to friends and family .
right ? like , seriously , nobody would do this .
but this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though i believe that &apos;s true -- but a crisis of human resources .
you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement .
but we &apos;ll certainly learn a lot .
and these guys , i mean , if they were in the u.s. , they might be actually here in this room .
go back to this image of the ax@@ e and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; who made them and for who ? &quot;
and the more em@@ powered the women become , the more they are able to re@@ move the vei@@ l , for example , or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel .
we only knew about the return of the je@@ ws and the de@@ cre@@ e of cy@@ rus from the he@@ bre@@ w scri@@ p@@ tures .
it &apos;s not perman@@ ently in the ex@@ clu@@ sive economic zones of these five central american countries , but it moves with the seas@@ on .
fran@@ co sac@@ ch@@ i : so many things to say , so little time .
when you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
audience : h@@ ello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lif@@ es@@ p@@ an of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
so they inhal@@ ed it , but they are not aware of it .
we read that each year , the van@@ cou@@ ver m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ al government monit@@ ors ph@@ th@@ al@@ ate concent@@ ration levels in ri@@ vers to ass@@ ess their safety .
when she wri@@ tes the exp@@ ose in about 20 years , don &apos;t believe a word of it .
but they don &apos;t exist . so i &apos;m having to make them .
expla@@ ins a lot , maybe .
all that from this little formul@@ a , which has whatever , five symb@@ ols in it .
but the oper@@ ative word is doing .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predi@@ ct@@ able order .
and then you want to decide , how are you going to draw the character ?
please , become am@@ bas@@ sad@@ ors .
they are believed to have magi@@ cal power@@ s .
the ph@@ ant@@ as@@ mag@@ ori@@ a , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through nar@@ ra@@ tive , vari@@ es from place to place .
purpose : so that we start them for agriculture , for medicine , for whatever , and for science , for the study of the fl@@ ora and the change of the forest .
big scre@@ am for em@@ ma everybody .
the po@@ em is called &quot; no man is an island . &quot;
the jun@@ k food industry is really great at pres@@ sing our pleasure butt@@ ons and fig@@ uring out what &apos;s the most pleas@@ ur@@ able .
you can see that the skin por@@ e structure changes enor@@ m@@ ously from stre@@ tched skin por@@ es to the regular skin tex@@ ture .
ti@@ m &apos;s sun@@ di@@ al hat .
where is that ?
there is also a big question of ambigu@@ ity .
as you can see , the system is very complex and vast .
and even if it &apos;s not that el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent -- and it &apos;s not -- it can still really make your day .
tony rob@@ bins discus@@ ses the &quot; invisible forces &quot; that motiv@@ ate everyone &apos;s actions -- and high-@@ fi@@ ves al gore in the front row .
we should study them with the same intensi@@ ty that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global war@@ ming , as we heard so el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently last night from al gore .
and they didn &apos;t really raise their hands , but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expen@@ se repor@@ ts .
d@@ l : we &apos;re going to play a tun@@ e and nat@@ al@@ ie &apos;s going to ac@@ company me on the pian@@ o .
it &apos;s good for your ideas . it &apos;s good for your creativity .
everybody in the town will know that this eleph@@ ant has dro@@ w@@ ned , so water will be there for seven months or nine months , or 12 months .
but the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the hab@@ it and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
actually we &apos;re talking to ab@@ c today about the os@@ cars .
and that le@@ tter basically said , &quot; we &apos;ll ob@@ serve this day .
i managed to do it .
why is this ?
it &apos;s why we think g@@ arb@@ age men might be paid more than people who work in par@@ ks , ok ?
and i hope , and one of my biggest dreams , is that , with our growing a@@ war@@ eness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world , that we &apos;ll give them the respect and protection that they deserve .
in fact , my colleague , jun@@ e co@@ hen , has taken to calling it &quot; radi@@ cal open@@ ness , &quot; because it works for us each time .
thank you .
they took all kni@@ ves and ra@@ z@@ ors and sc@@ is@@ s@@ ors from his room .
i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
so , you can find through your je@@ ep , a cam@@ el , and a c@@ art .
we destro@@ yed two pian@@ os and 10 televisi@@ ons in the process .
we had had a wonderful life there , and we decided to do something un@@ usual .
this young discipline called design , i think , is in fact the emerging eth@@ os formul@@ ating and then answer@@ ing a very new question : what sh@@ all we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created ?
now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
on the left hand side , there &apos;s a new type of mo@@ oring , which i &apos;ll show you in just a second .
he said , &quot; if all the insects disappeared , life on earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years .
and what &apos;s true for sensor@@ y information is true for information gener@@ ally .
why is what has been achiev@@ ed , or what the movement has done , been necessary but not suff@@ i@@ cient to the crime ?
and that &apos;s what i want to talk about today .
we learn those values on the left , and maybe they &apos;ll do health care or global war@@ ming leg@@ is@@ lation or something in the right .
my bridge co@@ ach , shar@@ on os@@ berg , says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else &apos;s in the world .
that you find across cultures and even across species ?
let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
he thought that space and time were explained by is@@ aa@@ c newton -- they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
pm : and ty@@ ler &apos;s here to show you the wal@@ k@@ along .
every single use therefore requ@@ ires per@@ mission ; without per@@ mission , you are a tr@@ es@@ pas@@ ser .
i estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second , which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does .
and he wasn &apos;t there , so i walked all after@@ no@@ on back .
it was great .
and then my dad would drive me on satur@@ days to a sc@@ rap met@@ al recycl@@ er where i got paid .
there &apos;s the avail@@ ability heu@@ ri@@ stic , which basically means we estimate the prob@@ ability of something by how easy it is to bring in@@ stances of it to mind .
this is in the mand@@ ara mountains , near the niger@@ ian bor@@ der in c@@ amer@@ o@@ on , mo@@ k@@ ou@@ le@@ k .
all this would do is wre@@ ck a family .
and i &apos;ll also show you a simple example , from 23@@ and@@ me again .
year 2000 , there was a big exp@@ o in germany .
but then , again , sometimes econom@@ ists get it wrong .
shame .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary leng@@ ths to be able to watch this program .
and in 1960 , frank dra@@ ke condu@@ cted the first seti ob@@ servation looking at two stars , ta@@ u c@@ et@@ i and ep@@ sil@@ on eri@@ dan@@ i , for about 150 hours .
and electric fields are not magne@@ tis@@ m .
so tony starts doing his hom@@ e@@ work .
through web@@ sites like patients like me or mana@@ ging your data on microsoft health@@ v@@ au@@ lt or google health , lever@@ a@@ ging this together in partici@@ pat@@ ory ways is going to become increasingly important .
they cover us in an invisible body ar@@ mor that keeps environmental insu@@ l@@ ts out so that we stay healthy .
you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve even been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re older still . time is mar@@ ching on and time is still mar@@ ching on . this day will soon be at an end and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s even sooner . this day will soon be at an end and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s sooner still . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re older still . thank you very much .
sing@@ er : on the day of jud@@ gment my god will call me my body will be put back together and god will ask me why i did this so@@ c : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , fac@@ ed with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the gl@@ ori@@ ous after@@ life ?
einstein : einstein .
it is a ch@@ ess game .
because laptop economics are the following : i say 50 percent here ; it &apos;s more like 60 , 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales , marketing , distribution and profit .
you get past me , the guy behind me has a spo@@ on . &quot;
and thing our process and the technology couldn &apos;t do , is they couldn &apos;t understand in@@ tent , the in@@ tent of the actor .
inspired by an ab@@ alone shell , angel@@ a bel@@ cher programs viruses to make elegant nan@@ os@@ c@@ ale structures that humans can use . sel@@ ecting for high-@@ performing genes through dire@@ cted evolution , she &apos;s produced viruses that can constru@@ ct powerful new bat@@ teri@@ es , clean hydro@@ gen fu@@ els and recor@@ d-@@ bre@@ aking solar cells . in her talk , she shows us how it &apos;s done . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tra@@ gic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human .
as a young repor@@ ter , i thought that i should do it in a different way , so that it has a maximum impact , since everybody knew that it was happening , and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system .
and plant .
there &apos;s a certain alg@@ a that swi@@ ms in the wild , and it needs to navi@@ gate towards light in order to phot@@ osy@@ n@@ thes@@ ize opti@@ m@@ ally .
but i can hear the sound . i can see a lot .
i was born in a sc@@ ots pres@@ by@@ teri@@ an ghet@@ to in canada , and dropped out of high school . i don &apos;t own a cell phone , and i paint on paper using g@@ ou@@ a@@ che , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
last thing , brea@@ thing . a problem a lot of us have , certainly , when you &apos;re swimming .
we actually have the technology and systems .
it &apos;s easy to say what we don &apos;t want .
she said the only way to help sud@@ an is to invest in the women , edu@@ c@@ ating them , edu@@ c@@ ating the children , so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society .
these are q@@ -@@ ti@@ ps stuck to my ro@@ om@@ mate with wi@@ g gl@@ ue .
you heard about ri@@ ots all across the land .
the fil@@ ms provi@@ ded commun@@ ality across all man@@ ner of divi@@ de .
the clu@@ bs were escap@@ ing me at each throw .
thank you very much .
my children came back to live with us .
this is a map of the entire world .
what does this mean ?
this is really getting more from less for more and more people , because these are all aff@@ ord@@ able treat@@ ments now .
and you want to go back and do it again .
and the techni@@ cian &apos;s like , &quot; ma &apos;@@ am , you &apos;ve got the mouse up against the screen ? &quot;
now , what &apos;s even worse than restri@@ ction is that adults often under@@ estimate kids abilities .
so i asked the people what happened .
think of the kids today . their childhood &apos;s a bit different .
and what first attra@@ cted me , or interested me , was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure , sort of ru@@ sty , this industrial reli@@ c .
it was told by an anony@@ mous k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l indian of southern al@@ as@@ ka to a mis@@ sion@@ ary in 18@@ 9@@ 6 , and here it is .
&quot; this is an incredible en@@ coun@@ ter with a man@@ ta . i &apos;m spe@@ ech@@ less .
wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad liter@@ acy means that they are no longer useful as re@@ pos@@ it@@ or@@ ies of knowledge .
briefly mention@@ ing , we have an asth@@ ma epidemic in this country .
ts : thank you , john .
lots of stuff . there &apos;s a little lea@@ f chair -- that gol@@ den looking thing is called &quot; lea@@ f . &quot;
so we put it on ki@@ ck@@ star@@ ter , and i &apos;m happy to say that , through the support of many people , not only here but online , the br@@ ck has been ki@@ ck@@ started , and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins .
it &apos;s that little green sli@@ ver on the hori@@ z@@ on , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
indeed , an out@@ break would be multiple kat@@ rin@@ as at once .
so i can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
before i went back to work after my year at home , i sat down and i wrote out a deta@@ iled , step@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step descri@@ ption of the ide@@ al bal@@ an@@ ced day that i aspi@@ red to .
you need a pack to pull together .
so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .
the researchers were not looking at docum@@ ented self-@@ repor@@ ts of childhood happiness or even studying old journ@@ als .
no , no , that &apos;s the only place a ship &apos;s been .
so , the laws of physics have this special property .
but i knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the strug@@ gles they were de@@ aling with .
but it &apos;s app@@ lic@@ able , again , to every organ system .
so much for promis@@ es .
we will watch children star@@ ve to death on tv .
we are playing with fire .
i want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening .
i suggest that , in fact , technology is the se@@ vent@@ h k@@ ing@@ dom of life .
and i &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
and , in fact , the first pion@@ e@@ ering treat@@ ments for people , as well as do@@ gs , are already becoming available .
i love the word &quot; euro@@ tr@@ ash . &quot;
if seti does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet , then it will be one of the most pro@@ found en@@ dea@@ vors in history .
a le@@ xic@@ on is a body of words that descri@@ bes a domain .
because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example , if i just open my little mot@@ or@@ bike ba@@ g -- we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
so the first is , it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an at@@ m machine .
and the po@@ et tells him what to do .
no , the dna tells a story that &apos;s very clear .
that &apos;s from robert bru@@ stein , the famous dra@@ ma cri@@ tic and director , in the new re@@ public about five years ago .
after hit@@ ting on a brilliant new life plan , our first instin@@ ct is to tell someone , but derek sivers says it &apos;s better to keep goals secret . he pres@@ ents research stre@@ t@@ ching as far back as the 19@@ 20@@ s to show why people who talk about their ambi@@ tions may be less likely to achieve them .
co@@ ke &apos;s success is relevant , because if we can analy@@ ze it , learn from it , then we can save lives .
and wikipedia has embra@@ ced this .
and ge@@ ologists have actually chri@@ sten@@ ed -- well , they &apos;re deb@@ ating whether to chri@@ sten -- the age that we &apos;re living in -- they &apos;re deb@@ ating whether to make it a new ge@@ ological e@@ po@@ ch called the anth@@ ro@@ po@@ c@@ ene , the age of man .
this little squid is called the fire sho@@ ot@@ er now it may look like a ta@@ sty mor@@ sel , or a pig &apos;s head with w@@ ings -- but if it &apos;s attac@@ ked , it puts out a bar@@ ra@@ ge of light -- in fact , a bar@@ ra@@ ge of phot@@ on tor@@ pe@@ does .
if they disappear , whole ec@@ osyste@@ ms in africa disappear .
i knew nothing about wofford and even less about metho@@ dis@@ m , but i was reas@@ su@@ red on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find , among the audi@@ tors in my classroom , a 9@@ 0-@@ year-old h@@ ung@@ arian , surrounded by a be@@ vy of midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged european women who seemed to function as an ent@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge of r@@ hin@@ e@@ ma@@ iden@@ s .
thir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
it &apos;s sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to motion by the air curr@@ ents .
but if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of hiv / aids in 199@@ 3 -- in india at that time it was sky@@ ro@@ ck@@ eting and nobody understood why , and everyone was actually very , very afraid .
adv@@ oc@@ ate for respect of personal dig@@ nity , for justice and peace , which sa@@ dly our ad@@ minist@@ ration has not been doing .
sus@@ an : &quot; lo@@ l , i have to write a 10 page paper . &quot;
it &apos;s a great cover .
so people who believed in psych@@ ological solutions didn &apos;t have a model .
in terms of your own personal role going forward , al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?

global war@@ ming is something that happens to all of us , all at once .
in the 197@@ 0s , the tur@@ no@@ ver of the red briga@@ des was seven million dollars .
so during that moment when that woman was experi@@ en@@ cing that pre@@ tend empath@@ y , i was thinking , &quot; that robot can &apos;t empath@@ ize .

&quot; it is , &quot; she said , &quot; to help create the social world and find a cre@@ di@@ ble place in it . &quot;
and the thing about states like ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as and ten@@ n@@ es@@ see is that they &apos;re both very rural , and they are edu@@ ca@@ tion@@ ally im@@ pover@@ ished .
there &apos;s a good reason why : the sh@@ allow water &apos;s full of pre@@ dat@@ ors -- here &apos;s a bar@@ ra@@ cu@@ da -- and if you &apos;re an o@@ ct@@ op@@ us or a cep@@ hal@@ op@@ od , you need to really understand how to use your surro@@ und@@ ings to hi@@ de .
for you this would be a more appropriate map .
why are people afraid of the ocean ?

we talk about african governments like they &apos;ve been dropped from mars , you know ?

we &apos;ll pick it up . we &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s stor@@ ed proper@@ ly . &quot; -- their yi@@ el@@ ds have gone up two@@ - , thre@@ e@@ - , four@@ fold and they figure it out , because it &apos;s the first guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed opportunity they &apos;ve had in their life .
this was scott fischer , rob hall , and@@ y har@@ ris , dou@@ g hansen and y@@ as@@ u@@ ko nam@@ ba .
but the hot sport right around las vegas and death valley and that area is very , very good .
i &apos;m predi@@ cting , though , as profit@@ able as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profit@@ able when you fly people at 200@@ ,000 dollars on something that you can actually oper@@ ate at a t@@ ent@@ h of that cost , or less -- this is going to be very profit@@ able .
so , it op@@ ens up more questions than it answers , i &apos;m afraid , but that &apos;s what , you know , science is really good at .
and he again leaves , and this time : water dri@@ pping , making a giant bo@@ w@@ l in the rock where it dri@@ ps in a stream .

it &apos;s when the young couple wh@@ is@@ per , &quot; tonight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
and so i thought that this was sort of the end of the story .
and so as the qu@@ a@@ ke was happening the news was repor@@ ted .
it &apos;s funny , someone just mentioned mac@@ gy@@ ver , because that was , like , i loved it , and when i was seven , i t@@ ap@@ ed a for@@ k to a dri@@ ll and i was like , &quot; hey , mom , i &apos;m going to o@@ live garden . &quot;
those are from &quot; the purpose driven life . &quot;
it also creates this incredibly interesting , i think , new amp@@ hibi@@ ous public space , where you can imagine working , you can imagine re@@ creating in a new way .
it had nothing to do with their intel@@ le@@ ct , the quality of their intel@@ le@@ ct .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with p@@ d@@ bs in this food pyramid : they ac@@ cum@@ ulate into the top of it .
i haven &apos;t invented anything at all ; it &apos;s a bi@@ otech@@ n@@ ology that has exist@@ ed for 4@@ 50 million years .
we are evolved den@@ i@@ zens of middle world , and that limits what we are cap@@ able of imag@@ ining . we find it intui@@ tively easy to gras@@ p ideas like , when a r@@ ab@@ bit moves at the sort of medium vel@@ oc@@ ity at which r@@ ab@@ bits and other middle world objects move , and h@@ its another middle world object , like a rock , it kno@@ cks itself out .
but i wanted to look not at the astronom@@ ical universe , but at the compu@@ ta@@ tional universe .
every cor@@ por@@ ation should have one , and every government should have a min@@ i@@ stry of detail .
suddenly , degrees aren &apos;t worth anything . isn &apos;t that true ?
i want to be able to go back to this re@@ e@@ f . thank you .
just from a design perspective , we didn &apos;t really understand how they did it , and so that &apos;s just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing .
i want to quickly say that although it does do it for 50 dollars , there are some limit@@ ations of this approach .
because the algorith@@ ms of wall street are dependent on one quality above all else , which is speed .
and many of them are not really familiar with the continent .
and bo@@ yle said , bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it .
the total width of it is 600 times smaller than the width of a deci@@ mal place .
it &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
however , i managed to get a hold of a bor@@ ane eventually , and here is the be@@ ast .
when i was five years old , my dad used to take me gro@@ cer@@ y sh@@ op@@ ping , and he would st@@ are in wonder at the little stick@@ ers that are on the fru@@ its and vege@@ tab@@ les .
and he was s@@ wis@@ s .
but when you get home or want to go in@@ doors at your work , it &apos;s got to be small enough and man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able enough to use inside .
we hope that in the near future , we &apos;ll be able to create model organis@@ ms that can break down not only ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates but a wide variety of different con@@ tam@@ in@@ ants .
6@@ 4@@ -year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19 .
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me . people who couldn &apos;t sit still .
there are ther@@ mo@@ cou@@ ples on the engine -- little sens@@ ors that dete@@ ct the heat when the sun@@ light stri@@ kes them .
col@@ or@@ ed them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the cas@@ a da musi@@ ca logo generator .
you know , sometimes there &apos;s a 10@@ - , 15@@ -@@ minute break out there when you &apos;re waiting for a wave to come in .
you just look at the con@@ sequences and see if , overall , it &apos;s for the good or for the worse .
in the late 198@@ 0s , in a moment of you@@ th@@ ful in@@ dis@@ cre@@ tion , i went to law school .
i will start at 18@@ 58 .
you can do this same kind of chip technology for ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys , for he@@ arts , for mus@@ cles , all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem , for the li@@ ver .
so for many of us , about 75 million americans , the appropriate response to insu@@ lin resist@@ ance may actually be to store it as fat , not the re@@ verse , getting insu@@ lin resist@@ ance in response to getting fat .
but with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our cap@@ abilities .
even during rush hour , it goes virtually un@@ used .
imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room .

one of the key technologies that &apos;s really important is what &apos;s called indu@@ ced plu@@ ri@@ pot@@ ent stem cells .
let me illu@@ strate this with what physici@@ sts call a back@@ -@@ of-@@ en@@ vel@@ op@@ e calcul@@ ation .
next i &apos;m going to introdu@@ ce you to some rela@@ tives .

these are not only important ec@@ osyste@@ ms in their own right , but they also serve as a bu@@ ffer to protect in@@ land communities .
each is ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely adap@@ ted to the environment in which it lives , inter@@ locked with other species to form ec@@ osyste@@ ms upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not be@@ gun even to imagine .
it &apos;s difficult . 20@@ 11 , 20@@ 13 . freedom tower , the memor@@ ial .
so really , it &apos;s not about the freedom of car@@ to@@ on@@ ists ; it &apos;s about your free@@ dom@@ s .
these human@@ -@@ indu@@ ced alter@@ ations occup@@ ying overall less than a milli@@ on@@ th of the el@@ ap@@ sed lifetime and seem@@ ingly oc@@ curr@@ ing with r@@ un@@ away speed ?
you know , we often think that language mi@@ rr@@ ors the world in which we live , and i find that &apos;s not true .
and what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle .
it shows how ob@@ servation , curi@@ osity and instin@@ ct work to create amazing art .
and then the school en@@ acts perfectly well .
i &apos;m not going to answer that . but i will answer some of the more popular questions .
ben , could you please look for an air@@ stri@@ p ? &quot;
so we &apos;ll have to use our computers to try to uns@@ cra@@ mble the cha@@ in .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of re@@ stor@@ ing perfect hearing .
it con@@ tains seven ver@@ tical stro@@ kes followed by this fis@@ h@@ -@@ like sig@@ n .
there isn &apos;t any construction going on . and so the sector shri@@ vels away .
that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 4@@ 8 years now , since i was a really small child .
in your eye , it becomes a grid formation , and therefore , it becomes transparent , as opposed to op@@ a@@ que .
i don &apos;t have to believe in it .
after all , it is their water right , and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream , it &apos;s their right to do so .
so the question is , what is invisible ?
they are de@@ lic@@ ac@@ ies .
in fact , every time i read in ireland , people get me all mista@@ ken and they say , &quot; oh , this is chris o &apos;@@ bar@@ ney from cor@@ k . &quot;
today , we believe we have about seven percent of the global market , and they &apos;re used in about 1@@ 20@@ -@@ od@@ d countries .
i &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but i want to talk about what i &apos;m doing now . what am i doing now ?
and i realized : i don &apos;t want to reach these people .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
if you have 500 gra@@ ms , 1@@ 000 , one kilo@@ gra@@ m , he will gr@@ ind it for it for you ; the fl@@ our@@ m@@ ill will not gr@@ ind such a small quanti@@ ty .
and so i &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; form , &quot; and i &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; function &quot; as a designer .
so of course whatever you don &apos;t really do yourself doesn &apos;t really get done proper@@ ly .
it &apos;s the simple idea that instead of gra@@ ding people incre@@ ment@@ ally in little bits and pieces , you give them one profi@@ le character av@@ at@@ ar which is constantly pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing in tiny , tiny , tiny little incre@@ ments which they feel are their own .
and you &apos;re very care@@ ful how you put the str@@ aps , particularly the leg str@@ aps because they go between your legs .
and en@@ cel@@ a@@ du@@ s is very white , it &apos;s very bright , and its surface is obviously wre@@ cked with fra@@ c@@ tures .
clearly , the profess@@ ors did not have as high of an op@@ ini@@ on of my work as i did .
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right .
turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
okay . this is camp one .
and yes , it &apos;s really fun , and yes , you should all go out and try it .
s@@ la@@ ves cost between 3,000 to 8@@ ,000 dollars in north america , but i could take you places in india or ne@@ p@@ al where human beings can be acqui@@ red for five or 10 dollars .

no , we learned something else .

when we get bigger distance from che@@ ating , from the object of money , for example , people che@@ at more .
by the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
j@@ h : well , i wish you the best of lu@@ ck with it .
the problem is they &apos;re just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars .
and she said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
for others , with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , ni@@ hi@@ li@@ sm , materi@@ al@@ ism .

middle world is the nar@@ row range of reality which we judge to be normal , as opposed to the que@@ er@@ ness of the very small , the very large and the very fast .
and what you can see is that over the last 25 years , gre@@ e@@ ce has bar@@ ely managed to save more than 10 percent of their g@@ dp .
and this amount is predi@@ cted to double in the next 40 years or so .
i &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
if all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together , it would be a joy , absolute joy .
because of this , all three bro@@ thers and their families had to vac@@ ate their home .
and the second is a phenomenon that mal@@ es are very , very good at finding fe@@ mal@@ es .
so we &apos;ve hand@@ ed out bra@@ cel@@ ets . small is the new big .
and that was , the people who have a strong sense of love and bel@@ on@@ ging believe they &apos;re worthy of love and bel@@ on@@ ging .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the colle@@ ctors like .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so how easily could i swa@@ p our un@@ wanted copy of &quot; 24 &quot; for a wanted copy of &quot; sex and the city ? &quot;
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rop@@ e disappe@@ ars .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for le@@ go , thousands of hom@@ e-@@ based businesses .
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newsp@@ ap@@ ers millions of fish that die in nor@@ way .
and to go back to the analo@@ g@@ y with nature , one can begin to think in terms of popul@@ ations , one can talk about per@@ mu@@ tations , about generations , about crossing and bre@@ eding to come up with a design .
and this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
and of course there &apos;re multiple dis@@ plays , to get the information to the di@@ ver .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
daniel den@@ nett , he &apos;s come over .
you and your cousins share a grand@@ par@@ ent in common .
and fewer older people answer@@ ed aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tively to that question than midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged people , and younger people as well .
how many americans ? 11 .
and i &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
and what we found -- this area is one of the poor@@ est parts of britain .
the story americans tell , the story upon which the american dream depends , is the story of limit@@ less choice .
what we do is we evol@@ ve it in a box with a light on .
now imagine ar@@ che@@ ologists dig@@ ging through the rub@@ ble of one of our cities .
now , how many people here think the tr@@ um@@ p number is higher for the fruit fly ?
we &apos;re all born into certain circumstances with particular physical tra@@ its , unique develop@@ mental experi@@ ences , geo@@ graphi@@ cal and historical con@@ tex@@ ts .
you &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the i@@ con@@ ic yellow ball -- that sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
and what you can see is , on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region , people paid little attention to her inno@@ cent belief and said she deser@@ ved a lot of bl@@ ame for the acci@@ dent .
again , a source of energy that &apos;s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are com@@ posed of stars .
we could have been done by l@@ unch here .
i produced in du@@ ba@@ i a show for ah@@ med ah@@ med to sho@@ w@@ case his new axis special to a pac@@ ked room .
when that cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or became con@@ tested , they decided that they wanted to re@@ cru@@ it a professional en@@ for@@ c@@ ement arm .
so every idea is basically being supported -- or every it@@ em , or every n@@ ou@@ n -- is being supported by the entire web .
the issues were , of course , eth@@ ni@@ c se@@ ct@@ arian violence .
so , einstein said that &quot; for an idea that does not first seem in@@ san@@ e , there is no hope . &quot;
do people have grid cells ?
we have to re@@ mix it . he &apos;s got a great voice .
and yet , on tu@@ es@@ day , oc@@ tober 1@@ 4@@ th , 194@@ 7 , ch@@ u@@ ck ye@@ a@@ ger cli@@ m@@ bed into the co@@ ck@@ p@@ it of his bell x-@@ 1 and he fle@@ w towards an un@@ known possibility , and in so doing , he became the first pil@@ ot to fly faster than the speed of sound .
the same is true of glob@@ alization .
and this is happening here .
this is what he said at ted in fe@@ bru@@ ary .
we think of people suffering , we think of people we love , but at some point , it can be a state which is all per@@ v@@ ading .
so you want to avo@@ id big forces as one princi@@ ple .
and here &apos;s a picture of sick ice .
because the moon doesn &apos;t have an atmosphere -- you can do an elli@@ p@@ tical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want .
i eventually made it to hawa@@ ii still alive .
worst talk ever ! &quot;
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as rich as we are today .
carbon@@ -@@ free electricity .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
so here we have a line and a point outside the line .
very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting results .
in this little example , you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links high@@ ligh@@ ted .
you don &apos;t like it ?
so how does it keep its body free of bacteria buil@@ d-@@ up ?
so , on the top , we had these beautiful ra@@ infor@@ est@@ s and an ocean , and under@@ ne@@ ath we had all this techn@@ osph@@ ere , we called it , which is where all the pump@@ s and the val@@ ves and the water tan@@ ks and the air hand@@ lers , and all of that .
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex@@ -@@ offen@@ ders re-@@ off@@ end within five years .
it &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve str@@ angel@@ y be@@ gun to forget it .
there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven &apos;t got data on the web as data .
and it gets to another issue that was probably in@@ appropriate to discus@@ s six months ago , but perhaps isn &apos;t now , which is , not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture , as what it had done to this city and that huge pla@@ za .
they depend on their mom@@ s to drop wor@@ ms in their little open mou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
pm : well secre@@ tary al@@ bright , i guess you &apos;ll be going to heaven .
i step on the bra@@ ke .
what the world needs now is to re@@ store the authority to make common choices .
so this is what he built .
we have seven children in my family .
and because these materials are so pro@@ li@@ fic , because they &apos;re found in so many places , there &apos;s one other place you &apos;ll find this material , sty@@ r@@ ene , which is made from ben@@ zene , a known car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
but nine of the 10 in those first hours .
and the daughter doesn &apos;t want to say anything .
le@@ wi@@ s , have the courage to go in there , because we are going to look after you every moment of it . &quot;
everybody else at the table said , &quot; fol@@ ks , that doesn &apos;t cut it .
do you know what that is ?
and yet deser@@ ti@@ fication is a major threat on all contin@@ ents , aff@@ ecting some 1@@ 10 countries and about 70 percent of the world &apos;s agri@@ cultural dr@@ y@@ lands .
so again , here we are at that equ@@ ator moment .
i use information , education .
and this is -- i &apos;ll demonstrate as best i can , not being dead .
i was one of the fo@@ unding members of the axis of evil com@@ edy tour .
in fact , i &apos;ve never found anybody that doesn &apos;t like the light that goes out slowly .
i think a lot of times we hear about diab@@ e@@ tics , diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cers , we just don &apos;t connect the ul@@ cer with the event@@ ual treatment , which is am@@ putation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it .
that left the ch@@ ass@@ is un@@ en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed , so you can do things like fold , so you can fold this little vehicle up to occup@@ y a tiny little foot@@ print .
so my team has taken five da@@ y@@ s-@@ worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and con@@ den@@ sed it into a 15@@ -@@ second time lap@@ se .
so , i hi@@ d in a time dimension .
it &apos;s totally appropriate for a four@@ -year-old .
so , the next time they tell you they &apos;re on to something , clearly they &apos;re not .
and now it &apos;s not that hard , you know , here &apos;s the apple , here &apos;s the orange , you know , the earth goes around , that kind of stuff .
i had started out with a thousand tedtalks and i had 600 si@@ x-@@ word sum@@ mar@@ ies for those .
they will switch from one country to another , from one jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction to another -- moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to globally police oper@@ ations like this .
but schi@@ zophren@@ ia pres@@ ents itself across a wide ar@@ ray of soci@@ o@@ economic status , and there are people with the ill@@ ness who are ful@@ l@@ -@@ time professi@@ on@@ als with major responsi@@ bilities .
so what we &apos;ve been doing a couple of years -- but last year was a big year -- is we started tag@@ ging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fi@@ deli@@ ty and movements and things like that .
thanks to my an@@ ce@@ stors for rob@@ bing me of my invention .
this is the wrong way of looking at it .
all right , so let &apos;s watch this clip again .
and i felt bad@@ ly for not having done a good job .
i &apos;ll show you in a moment , that &apos;s actually quite useful .
sex ti@@ ps are not glam@@ or@@ ous .
and i think the theater is a place where we truly en@@ han@@ ce life with light .
now it does depend on how you measure it , of course , but one estimate has put the dra@@ in at 250 million dollars per day .
oliver sac@@ ks : i was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your cha@@ irs .
there was no more space in the house . so i went out to the back@@ y@@ ard , and without any previ@@ ous building experience , and about 3,000 dollars and some recycl@@ ed materials , i built this space .
and she looked at me , and it was like the successful arm@@ -@@ wre@@ st@@ le , and then , after that , she deli@@ ver@@ ed an extraordinary account of what her life really was like .
but dra@@ gon@@ flies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
just leave you with four gol@@ den rules , for those of you who run businesses , for commercial sound .
and i would use this study , a recent study by phili@@ p land@@ ri@@ g@@ an , to motiv@@ ate a different view of health , where he went to most of the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cians in manhattan and the new york area and log@@ ged what they spent their patient hours on .
and so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ r@@ on@@ ist@@ ically a clas@@ si@@ fication by fa@@ thers &apos; occu@@ pa@@ tions , so single parents go on their own .
and so my work , really , is trying to understand the character of that mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation compared to the cen@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation to see what mysteri@@ es we can understand from dinosau@@ rs and from other animals about what life on dri@@ f@@ ting contin@@ ents really can tell us about evolution .
so when they try to give back , we shouldn &apos;t be on the defen@@ sive .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
one wants to say , &quot; non@@ sense . why not ? &quot;
then i &apos;d tell them , &quot; well , i &apos;m getting my hi@@ p re@@ placed -- in 18 months .
i &apos;ve gone and had an f@@ mri myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
these are the data . you fa@@ iled the pop qui@@ z , and you &apos;re har@@ dly five minutes into the lec@@ ture .
it is really big -- 6@@ 5 million square miles -- and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8@@ ,000 miles .
i was recently in egyp@@ t , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . they were tor@@ turing everybody all the time . &quot;
these are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3,000 .
this high school d@@ rop@@ out died at the age of 8@@ 2 , a for@@ mi@@ d@@ able intellectual , co@@ fo@@ under and first ce@@ o of the he@@ bre@@ w university of j@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ em , and fo@@ under of scho@@ cken books , an acc@@ la@@ im@@ ed im@@ print that was later acqui@@ red by random house .
and how do we do that ?
so , can you imagine new york poli@@ ce@@ men giving out con@@ dom@@ s ?
at this point , something else happened .
however , i think there may be a win@@ -@@ win solution here where both par@@ ties can win this debate , and that is , we face a situation where it &apos;s carbon cap@@ s on this planet or die .
in each one of those ass@@ ess@@ ments that we write , we always tag on a sum@@ mary , and the sum@@ mary is written for a non-@@ scientific audience .
and these teles@@ cop@@ es , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
pur@@ ple are t@@ we@@ ets . green are ge@@ olo@@ cation .
the purpose of influence is not to build your e@@ go , or your net worth .
and it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it gains moment@@ um and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
so , he wasn &apos;t only thinking about them ; he built one . this is the machine he built .
all right , let me then finish off with four general stat@@ ements , an example and two ap@@ hor@@ is@@ ms .
dev@@ du@@ tt pat@@ tan@@ ai@@ k : east v@@ s. west -- the my@@ ths that my@@ sti@@ fy
why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us ?
now not surpris@@ ingly , that influ@@ enced some people to think we were onto something .
this is not un@@ common .
and i think i knew from day one that it wasn &apos;t the right job for me .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i haven &apos;t quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life .
and she put in the world &apos;s first national need@@ le exchange program , and other countries followed suit : australi@@ a , the ne@@ ther@@ lands and few others .
these two cur@@ ves are aver@@ ages : standard &amp; amp ; poor , the blue one ; and the red one is standard &amp; amp ; poor &apos;s from which the five biggest dis@@ continu@@ i@@ ties are taken out .
in fact , some of you might well know that the bar@@ ber pole , the red and white stri@@ p@@ es , represents the blood ban@@ da@@ ges of the bar@@ ber surgeon , and the re@@ cep@@ tac@@ les on either end repres@@ ent the p@@ ots in which the blood was collected .
so , they tried it on a few p@@ ig@@ s , and none of the p@@ ig@@ s were killed .
simple , stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward , common@@ sensi@@ cal -- also , largely un@@ tested .
something else that we created , and this was an idea that i had a couple of years ago , and so we &apos;ve done a project on this .
we thought it would be really ne@@ at to do that , and one of the problems we really were worried about is : how do we get legal on the side@@ walk ?
and we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of gl@@ ac@@ ial fe@@ atures on it .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
and there &apos;s hypo@@ ther@@ mi@@ a .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ran@@ ked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 9@@ 1 , and li@@ sting things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stim@@ ulate me , and bal@@ an@@ cing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
this is oec@@ d . the rich country . the country club of the u.@@ n .
and eventually some cro@@ w gets a bright idea that , &quot; hey , there &apos;s lots of co@@ ins lying around from the first stage , lying around on the ground , &quot; hop@@ s down , pi@@ cks it up , dro@@ ps it in the s@@ lot .
these differences were highly significant .
you don &apos;t want americans to die . protect our tro@@ ops .
and i got this picture , and i thought , &quot; this picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life . he will forever have this photo in his family photo al@@ bu@@ ms . &quot;
they &apos;re quite vital places , these communities .
when you have to do something really che@@ ap@@ ly , it &apos;s hard to get perfect cor@@ ners and stuff .
well in the end , what we can also do : we use a lot of old newsp@@ ap@@ ers to make cap@@ s .
i &apos;ve been working on whales and dol@@ ph@@ ins in ireland for 20 years now , and they &apos;re kind of a bit more dra@@ matic .
which is ridiculous , of course , but that &apos;s one of the exc@@ uses that mana@@ gers give .
three years ago he got a le@@ tter sig@@ ned by all 700 employees of la sc@@ ala , musical employees , i mean the musi@@ cians , saying , &quot; you &apos;re a great condu@@ ctor . we don &apos;t want to work with you . please res@@ ign . &quot;
reg@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity is the contr@@ ary of rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess because the basic aspect of the world is very r@@ ough .
well , if i turn up the amp@@ li@@ tude too much , i &apos;m having an effect on the pressure , which means during the making of that s@@ ine wave , the speed at which it is pro@@ pag@@ ating is shifting .
in fact , 9@@ 6 percent of the planet are foreig@@ ners .
now , j@@ ane good@@ all has here a play face along with one of her favorite chim@@ ps .
this te@@ stim@@ ony was deeply critical of my colleagues , of my minist@@ ers , who had , in my view had per@@ pet@@ rated a war on a fal@@ se@@ hood .
a third to a half of the population are introver@@ ts -- a third to a half .
in fact , they &apos;re usually the people who are best at it .
obviously , i &apos;m having a fab@@ ul@@ ous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
hopefully everybody ? more than 10 ?
in front of them on a screen is information about the w@@ ine .
if you don &apos;t bri@@ be the off@@ ic@@ er , then you will get a traffic ti@@ cket -- or , as is the case of &quot; far@@ go , &quot; worse -- whether the honest off@@ ic@@ er is honest or dis@@ honest .
so , how did she know that she was right ?
and then when we look at religions , we can see that the eastern religions , indeed there &apos;s not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children .
so let &apos;s think about the in@@ ference .
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , spe@@ ech@@ less .
we can use the same technologies that fis@@ hers use to identi@@ fy where the species are , in order to close the area when it &apos;s most vulner@@ able , which may , in some cases , be year-@@ ro@@ und .
so , for instance the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a gets up every morning medi@@ tating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integra@@ l compon@@ ent of human happiness .
the citizens didn &apos;t only experience in@@ cess@@ ant g@@ un@@ fire but also expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons and burning trucks used as bar@@ ri@@ ca@@ des across the city , so truly like a bat@@ t@@ le@@ field .
i saw people strug@@ gl@@ ing to get by , not knowing what was what and what was next .
it &apos;s not only carbon di@@ oxide that has this ho@@ ck@@ ey stick pattern of acceler@@ ated change .
so if you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed by an evil spirit caus@@ ing neuro@@ logic or psychiat@@ ric problems , then the way to treat this is , of course , to make a hole in your sk@@ ull and let the evil spirit escap@@ e .
so today for the first time , we &apos;re un@@ vei@@ ling a new project , which is a collaboration with strat@@ as@@ ys , and it &apos;s called 4@@ d printing .
thank you power station .
just be grat@@ eful robert reed didn &apos;t sho@@ ve that bomb up his ass .
because remember dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s c@@ ell@@ phone be@@ ep@@ ing .
putting them there made them more recogni@@ z@@ able .
and so , if you had some extra band@@ width , you &apos;d deliver a message for someone .
we created public health care .
if we take the overall tur@@ no@@ ver of the bio@@ control industry worldwide , it &apos;s 250 million dollars .
not a car@@ ess , but a wave of pain .
he has been very suppor@@ tive of me .
we looked at a way to break up a par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a into individual pet@@ als that would track .
royal de lu@@ x@@ e &apos;s giant pu@@ pp@@ ets come into a city and they live there for a few days .
you change its environment , and the object will flow .
that was the first time we &apos;ve seen that .
and now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and dev@@ ise even simpler processes and impro@@ v@@ ements .
there &apos;s only 8@@ ,000 bas@@ king shark fe@@ mal@@ es in the world ?
and these were the developing countries : they had large families and they had rela@@ tively short lives .
it &apos;s hard to do high-@@ rise .
a new study by chris mur@@ ray at harvard shows that if you look at the dat@@ ab@@ ases that were kept by the bri@@ ts in india , there was a 3@@ 1@@ -@@ fold greater death rate among the indi@@ ans .
the very practice is de@@ mor@@ alized , and the prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers are de@@ mor@@ alized .
and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a vi@@ able pro@@ position .
these cru@@ de tools were around for thousands of centuries , until around 1.@@ 4 million years ago when homo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s started shap@@ ing single , thin stone bla@@ des , sometimes ro@@ unded ov@@ als , but often in what are to our eyes an ar@@ re@@ sting , sym@@ me@@ tri@@ cal poin@@ ted lea@@ f or te@@ ar@@ drop form .
but now , to be a good sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an -- and i always say , and to be a good american -- for me , is not simply to con@@ grat@@ ulate myself for the individual acts of care .
they have their own tests , of course , and so they tested her for over 70 different as@@ says , for every sort of bacteria and fun@@ gu@@ s and viral as@@ say you can buy off the shelf : s@@ ars , metap@@ neu@@ mo@@ virus , hiv , r@@ s@@ v -- all these .
but they quickly see , &quot; you know what , other people aren &apos;t doing so much though .
how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that ? &quot;

when i was born , this idea was already con@@ cei@@ ved by pion@@ e@@ ers such as the fr@@ y bro@@ thers and l@@ ars lek@@ sell , who is know actually as the inv@@ ent@@ or of the gam@@ ma@@ kni@@ fe .
that little issue took the team two years to solve .
this was not a de@@ va@@ st@@ ating stro@@ ke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
so in evolutionary sc@@ ales , movements get better .
so this really , really fascinated me .
and actually , i take my projects very seriously , because i had tw@@ ins during my year , so i definitely take my projects seriously .
and every woman in the room here has benef@@ ited from that women &apos;s health initiative .
and then i go and have some te@@ a .
it &apos;s not this , right ? it &apos;s not a child &apos;s to@@ y .
we take this cur@@ ved 12@@ -@@ dimensional space and transform it into a flat four@@ -@@ dimensional space .
one reason that there &apos;s this optimism is because , contr@@ ary to what many people have said , most egyp@@ ti@@ ans think things really have changed in many ways .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn &apos;t have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
after exploring recent@@ l@@ y-@@ ab@@ and@@ oned buildings , i felt that everything could fall into ru@@ ins very fast : your home , your office , a sh@@ op@@ ping mall , a church -- any man@@ -@@ made structures around you .
very quickly , he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touch@@ pad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me , &quot; i have never seen a television where you can do something . &quot;
but as many people have said , there &apos;s a large attempt to supp@@ res@@ s what &apos;s going on .
cru@@ el@@ ty : i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypo@@ cri@@ tically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cat@@ s , do@@ gs and other p@@ ets .
who@@ o@@ o !
and i said , &quot; do you pra@@ y ? &quot; when i looked at the group , i said , &quot; do you pra@@ y ? &quot;
but once they &apos;ve gone from being trans@@ gressi@@ ve people whose behaviors we don &apos;t want to con@@ done to being aids victi@@ ms , we come over all com@@ passionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives .
and there were no super@@ ficial conver@@ sa@@ tions as we shared our inner@@ most thou@@ ghts , our fe@@ ars , and our hop@@ es for life after the spin@@ al ward .
first of all , i &apos;m a ge@@ ek .
supp@@ ose i were talking with you and i was introdu@@ cing you to my uncle .
it &apos;s com@@ posed entirely of ice cr@@ yst@@ als cas@@ c@@ ading from the upp@@ er reach@@ es of the tro@@ pos@@ ph@@ ere , and as these ice cr@@ yst@@ als fall , they pass through different la@@ yers with different win@@ ds and they speed up and slow down , giving the cloud these br@@ us@@ h@@ -@@ stro@@ ked appe@@ ar@@ ances , these br@@ us@@ h@@ -@@ stro@@ ke forms known as fall stre@@ a@@ ks .
and there is a g@@ yp@@ sum b@@ elt running below it .
this is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bu@@ cket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
and the only part which is natural is a number , the rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess of the cloud , which is taken from nature .
can this help us inspi@@ re the design of novel robots ?
now , i also happen to be ga@@ y .
something like a billion people depend on fish , the quanti@@ ty of fish in the oceans .
but i had this question .
the climate is changing .
&#91; &quot; chair &quot; &#93; orange , good . &#91; &quot; table &quot; &#93; green .
that three-@@ year-old girl is still part of you .
i had 13 students when i first walked into the class .
for example , if you have read — i suspe@@ ct many of you have done so — read the book by thomas frie@@ d@@ man called &quot; the world is flat , &quot; he said , basically , in his book that , you know , this fear for free trade is wrong because it assu@@ mes , it &apos;s based on a mista@@ ken assu@@ mption that everything that can be invented has been invented .
for a hundred years , despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing , we didn &apos;t believe it .
well , what we &apos;re seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organi@@ zed .
but this lady here taught me , ha@@ h , taught me so much .
this is a bo@@ whe@@ ad whale .
when you look at how the fe@@ der@@ al government sp@@ ends money , so this is the bat@@ tle right here , 55 percent , more than half , is on social security , medi@@ care , medi@@ ca@@ id , a few other health programs , 20 percent defen@@ se , 19 percent dis@@ cre@@ tion@@ ary , and six percent interest .
the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ; itali@@ an soldiers , on t@@ ours of four months ; the american military , on t@@ ours of 12 months .
africa has had a long tradition of design , a well-@@ defin@@ ed design sensi@@ bility , but the problem in africa has been that , especially today , designers in africa strug@@ gle with all forms of design because they are more ap@@ t to look out@@ ward for influence and inspi@@ ration .
and after i gave them statistics , they said , &quot; yes . okay . you can use all the radio stations , television stations . &quot;
after telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature , suddenly we were fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with our weak@@ ness , with our l@@ ack of control , as the oil bur@@ st out of every attempt to con@@ tain it -- &quot; top hat@@ s , &quot; &quot; top kills &quot; and , most memor@@ ably , the &quot; jun@@ k shot &quot; -- the bright idea of fir@@ ing old ti@@ r@@ es and golf balls down that hole in the world .
but now i &apos;m going to return you to the real world .
so -- okay , i can now see that man running out there , and i can see that guy running out there .
it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being lin@@ ked from one place to another , that being ti@@ ghtly lin@@ ked in a group , is a very good thing .
and these sub-@@ movements are just kind of floating around , and as the wall h@@ its you , they connect themselves &quot; oh , 3@@ 60 fli@@ p , i &apos;m going to make that . &quot;
but all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters , they need to use these individu@@ ally dist@@ in@@ ctive whist@@ les to come back together again .
and yet , if you take , for example , sub@@ clinical o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , a bone thin@@ ning disease , the pre@@ condition , otherwise known as o@@ ste@@ open@@ ia , you would have to treat 2@@ 70 women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone .
what happens after you have the heart attack , this block@@ age ?
and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent wal@@ ks into the room .
and the dra@@ ma is , of course , that when the system does this , the logic may change .
su@@ z@@ anne , just a curi@@ osity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
but , anyway , that &apos;s where i grew up , in this little to@@ f@@ u factory in se@@ attle , and it was kind of like this : a small room where i kind of grew up . i &apos;m big there in that picture .
i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago , and some of you vis@@ ited a to z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in east africa .
in christ@@ mas , where the food web is really tri@@ mm@@ ed down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not re@@ covered .
but maybe it just means you &apos;re more sensitive to what most people can &apos;t see or feel .
it can be anywhere in the world at any time .
it blocks the right too , as it makes princi@@ pl@@ ed argu@@ ments of the right increasingly impossible .
she said , &quot; i &apos;ll buy it , but i &apos;m also going to repli@@ cate it . &quot;
and there &apos;s a picture of ros@@ al@@ ind . she really , you know , in one sense she was a chem@@ ist , but really she would have been trained -- she didn &apos;t know any organic chemi@@ stry or qu@@ ant@@ um chemi@@ stry .
and yet , i do believe that in every social space , in every public space , there is a desire to communicate more than just that bl@@ unt thought , that bl@@ unt technique , but something that pin@@ points , and can point in various dire@@ ctions forward , back@@ ward , side@@ ways and around .
cir@@ cus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , dra@@ ma .
they &apos;re going to press left or right .
and that meant actually desig@@ ning cust@@ om technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use .
so we ended up spending nine years convin@@ cing the government that there were lots of o@@ iled pengu@@ ins .
we &apos;ve been out for two and a half years , and we &apos;ve got about another two and a half years yet to go .
and what they found with the first se@@ a@@ water greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more fres@@ h@@ water than it needed for the plants inside .
and again , you can think of this as almost m@@ apping our inter@@ state highways , if you will .
so homo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , the first technolog@@ y-@@ creating species , the species that combined a cogni@@ tive function with an op@@ pos@@ able app@@ en@@ da@@ ge -- and by the way , ch@@ impan@@ ze@@ es don &apos;t really have a very good op@@ pos@@ able th@@ um@@ b -- so we could actually mani@@ pul@@ ate our environment with a power gri@@ p and fine motor co@@ ordin@@ ation , and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology .
two days later , the doctors gave the mit@@ ch@@ ells a choice : they could either re@@ move barbara off the life support , in which case she would die within a matter of hours , or they could keep her on life support , in which case she might still die within a matter of days .
and i &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
these bad viruses really don &apos;t have any inten@@ tion of showing up first in english or span@@ ish or french .
first he let me go to the prime minister of the country , who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars -- that &apos;s what we needed in israel -- i &apos;ll give you country to invest the 200 million into .
i have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years .
does it matter to the mi@@ dden workers what the pat@@ roll@@ ers are doing ? &quot;
and the imp@@ lications of this -- there are many , but one i just want to point out , is that there must be amazing feedback lo@@ ops .
how early ?
but even as morality bin@@ ds people together into a unit , into a team , the cir@@ cl@@ ing blin@@ ds them .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just gr@@ ant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
there is an area that is the oceans , cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
but the problem is that , when i left home and went to college , i started missing his comm@@ ands .
but this next decade -- and that &apos;s a real thing .
and for that to happen , you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected , to en@@ able this kind of innovation , as this liber@@ t@@ arian tells us , between these two creative cultures , a commercial and a sharing culture .
and then , i sli@@ ced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement .
so i &apos;ll just give you an example from my lab .
it wasn &apos;t invented until the 197@@ 0s .
and let &apos;s face it , we all live down@@ stream in an era of global war@@ ming and climate change .
and he just looked at me and laugh@@ ed , and he said , he said , &quot; a@@ dam , that &apos;s a really novel idea , but we &apos;re an ultra@@ conserva@@ tive organization .
so , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science i &apos;ve done since &quot; the bottom billion , &quot; so it &apos;s new .
because dra@@ gon@@ flies need fres@@ h water to bre@@ ed .
and if it will be , it &apos;s the right thing to do , and if not , re@@ think it . &quot;
the good news is that there are now more than 4@@ ,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
this is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly facebook has con@@ qu@@ ered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depen@@ ding on how you like the way facebook mana@@ ges its service .
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
and if you bring them in for inter@@ n@@ ships in your companies , the thing about the auti@@ sm , as@@ per@@ ger@@ -@@ y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . don &apos;t just say , &quot; design new software . &quot;
i sort of think about it as the dna -- these colors , the red , blue , yellow , the pri@@ mary colors and white and black .
war@@ m@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded animals take a huge hit at this time .
we will go into the third dimension and there &apos;s been tremendous progress , just in the last few years , of getting three-dimensional , self-@@ organi@@ zing mole@@ cular circu@@ its to work .
and i built the first building , and guess what happened ?
they don &apos;t normally go this slowly . it &apos;s in slow motion .
there is another source of sol@@ ace and comfort for all this .
and it works . it works .
all right . so before any one goes out of syn@@ c , i &apos;ll just put those right there .
very simple -- only has about 24@@ 6 genes -- but we were able to completely syn@@ thes@@ ize that genome .
and let me just sum@@ mar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 10@@ 0,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
and she was wearing a car@@ dig@@ an , because it was now fully night and a chil@@ l was coming in off the ocean .
so that &apos;s a still from the video there .
you know the expression , &quot; beg@@ ging only gets you so far &quot; ?
now mark my words , it &apos;s only a matter of time before we &apos;re going to be able to per@@ form a goo@@ g@@ le-@@ like search and see a cum@@ ul@@ ative picture of our reputation capital .
he spo@@ ke six languages , he played 15 musical instru@@ ments , he was a lic@@ en@@ sed pil@@ ot , he had once been a san fran@@ cis@@ co c@@ able car oper@@ ator , he was an exper@@ t in sw@@ ine nutrition , da@@ ir@@ y cattle , di@@ xi@@ eland jazz , film no@@ ir , and we did travel the country , and the world , and we did have a lot of kids .
this is a nur@@ ses &apos; college -- there are 300 nur@@ ses studying .
there was so much to learn .
they can be a little skep@@ tical ; i &apos;ll come back to that .
and on the sweet spot on the stage , tatum starts playing ...
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in santa ana .
they &apos;re not fun enough . they &apos;re not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that a@@ wa@@ its us . but i would argu@@ e that if we want to see the kinds of innova@@ tions , the hope@@ ful and exciting innova@@ tions that we hear talked about here at ted , in clean energy , in clean education , in development , if we want to see those adop@@ ted and we want to see those sc@@ al@@ ed , we want to see them become the govern@@ ance of tomorrow , then we must all partici@@ pate , then we must get involved .
i didn &apos;t mention to abed his pri@@ or driving record -- 2@@ 7 viol@@ ations by the age of 25 , the last , his not shifting his truck into a low ge@@ ar on that may day — and i didn &apos;t mention my pri@@ or record -- the quad@@ ri@@ ple@@ gi@@ a and the ca@@ the@@ ters , the inse@@ curi@@ ty and the loss — and when abed went on about how hurt he was in the cr@@ ash , i didn &apos;t say that i knew from the police re@@ port that he &apos;d escap@@ ed serious injury .
and i think that &apos;s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
ue : the pur@@ est and the best feeling would be with only go@@ g@@ gles .
and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall .
when the subject is still very thin@@ ly popul@@ ated , you can with di@@ li@@ gence and hard work become the world authority .
how can we use numbers as the basis for a moral fra@@ me@@ work ?
and these animals disappeared , and a separate life , ma@@ mm@@ als , radi@@ ated out to take their place . and so , we know this in extraordinary detail . and so this is a core from near ber@@ mu@@ da . we know that the tsun@@ am@@ is , the earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , and the things that we &apos;ve experi@@ enced in the entire record of human@@ kind history can &apos;t really quite get around the kind of dis@@ aster that this repres@@ ented for the earth .
by 19@@ 80 , it had been sub@@ divided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some bu@@ ffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
he &apos;s plan@@ ning to eat that f@@ ence for dinner .
now , for those of you who aren &apos;t familiar with this device , it &apos;s a $ 40 video game controller .
and you can think about those as hei@@ ght , width and dep@@ th .
of course , it &apos;s this big .
so i &apos;m surprised .
i am always ama@@ zed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work .
as a nation , no we &apos;re not .
ce : all of this has happened in the blin@@ k of an eye .
i mean he had la@@ id it all out .
a lot of repor@@ ters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al-@@ q@@ a@@ e@@ da or terrorism .
da@@ ve eg@@ gers : my wish : once upon a school

our calcul@@ ation shows that qu@@ ant@@ um tun@@ n@@ eling of the higgs field is not likely to occu@@ r in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
we &apos;ve got over 1@@ ,000 species . we have 13@@ 7 bird species as of today .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are j@@ ump@@ ing around and not foc@@ using on one topic . &quot;
plastic is not pu@@ ri@@ fied by the re-@@ mel@@ ting process like glass and met@@ al .
henry ev@@ ans and ch@@ ad jen@@ kins : meet the robots for humanity
i think this approach can explain differences in people &apos;s taste in art .
if there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all .
our experience points to an amazing increase in human produ@@ ctivity by over 20 percent by using these plants .
i &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
the next story is called &quot; the ha@@ ver@@ piece collection &quot; a non@@ descri@@ pt war@@ eh@@ ouse , visible for a moment from the nor@@ th@@ bo@@ und lan@@ es of the pr@@ y@@ kus@@ h@@ ko expres@@ s@@ way , ser@@ ves as the temporary re@@ sting place for the ha@@ ver@@ piece collection of european dri@@ ed fruit .
it &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
we can apply this to wa@@ ste@@ water treatment plants to clean up our ri@@ vers and other natural resources .
and that to me was a bad start to the after@@ life , having to wit@@ ness your own fun@@ er@@ al and feel gra@@ ti@@ fied .
the 198@@ 0s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of alex@@ is car@@ ring@@ ton .
and you know the little plastic dra@@ wers you can get at tar@@ get ?
at the bottom of the cli@@ ff , we find that they &apos;re rare as h@@ ens &apos; teeth .
and i said , that might do the same thing , whatever it is .
you can also deliver heat more effi@@ ci@@ ently using heat pump@@ s which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden into your house .
i also had the good fortun@@ e to be in those lec@@ tures , up in the bal@@ con@@ y .
i published everywhere . i wrote down and measu@@ red everything , and i said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secre@@ tary in the west .
the first kids got their laptops . they got them by ship , and i &apos;m talking now about 7@@ ,000 , 8@@ ,000 at a time went out this week .
but that feeling of puzz@@ lement is struc@@ tural to contemporary art .
at the beginning i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .
and it &apos;s a pretty big building .
so lu@@ ke , you go to your communications profess@@ ors -- you &apos;re maj@@ oring in communications -- and you ask them for per@@ mission to come to ted , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their re@@ action ?
as my wife put it , &quot; you &apos;ve wash@@ ed away the clo@@ on@@ ey co@@ o@@ ties . &quot;
and interest@@ ingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ ment@@ ali@@ sts .
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of a spider named char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , silk is terri@@ fic .
it &apos;s only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it &apos;s a very in@@ tri@@ cate , complicated kind of a design , right ?
in the 197@@ 0s and 198@@ 0s , a gener@@ ous spirit suff@@ used the internet , whose us@@ ers were few and far between . but today , the net is ubi@@ quit@@ ous , conne@@ cting billions of people , machines and essenti@@ al pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulner@@ able to cy@@ ber@@ -@@ attack or mel@@ t@@ down . internet pion@@ e@@ er dan@@ ny h@@ illi@@ s argu@@ es that the internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a cl@@ ari@@ on call for us to develop a plan b : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the internet crash@@ es .
but guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
there are hundreds of student inno@@ v@@ ators with fantastic projects .
that &apos;s why we heard about the bac@@ king away from the k@@ yo@@ to proto@@ co@@ l , for example .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
the ber@@ lin wall falls . we do desert stor@@ m .
quick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
however , these two countries have the iden@@ tical gin@@ i co@@ efficient , which is a measure of income equ@@ ality .
yeah ! i &apos;m gon@@ na get crazy now .
look at the coffee table -- it gro@@ ws in hei@@ ght and width to seat 10 .
so now we have this blue gene super@@ computer .
so in the united states , since the ad@@ vent of treatment in the middle of the 199@@ 0s , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 0-@@ percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the number of hiv-@@ infe@@ cted children .
i was the only human being in an area one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half times the size of america , five-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half thousand square miles .
and that propor@@ tion is pri@@ mar@@ ily gene@@ tically determined .
but it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geo@@ graphy of the comm@@ union we call dinner .
and i &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful histor@@ ic ima@@ gery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well .
they were the normal high school cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um for japanese students -- the other 4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 99 students in the school , who were japanese , bes@@ i@@ des the american .
along with that is a kind of spirit of equ@@ ality . we &apos;re all basically equal .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start ri@@ ding on s@@ co@@ ot@@ ers .
and last but not least , you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate oper@@ a@@ tional bud@@ gets to over@@ come the building in fact performing to allow the company to over@@ come their biggest problem .
so those are the kind of sta@@ kes that we &apos;re after .
woo@@ dy nor@@ ris : hy@@ person@@ ic sound and other inven@@ tions
it was able to land on the ice , take away bec@@ k and the other survi@@ vors , one by one , and get them off to ka@@ th@@ mand@@ u in a clinic before we even got back to base camp .
hat@@ ed the job .
we don &apos;t have much time , and i &apos;m going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out , because there &apos;s a lot of other things that are going to be said .
here is our fo@@ unding meeting .
they started with two and they ended with two .
it was deep in my imagination .
so it &apos;s a very hard model to ac@@ cept .
but in hir@@ os@@ hi@@ ma , some people were wi@@ ped clean away , leaving only a wri@@ st@@ watch or a di@@ ary page .
he clos@@ es his eyes .
and i &apos;ve looked globally , i &apos;ve taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years , and looked to see what the relationship is .
and the problem with escap@@ ing your da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day life is that you have to come home eventually .
we bring in civil society , we bring in n@@ gos , we bring in researchers and scientists to have an infor@@ med discus@@ sion -- sometimes a bat@@ tle roy@@ ale -- to figure out what are the key imp@@ acts of these products , what is a global ben@@ ch@@ mark , what &apos;s an accep@@ table impact , and design standards around that .
there &apos;s two factor@@ ies of this scale in the same town .
it &apos;s a da@@ ily newsp@@ aper with a de@@ ad@@ line of 4 p@@ .@@ m .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 3@@ 00,000 people in tam@@ il na@@ du , india .
this time next year , in oc@@ tober , i &apos;m leading a team of three .
now , is this possible ? people would ask : how much would that cost ?
and we saw this guy , ha@@ i@@ ba@@ o .
th@@ us 9@@ 00,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
so i ur@@ ge you to take that path .
i love you more than mary , j@@ ane , susie , pen@@ el@@ op@@ e , ing@@ rid , ger@@ tru@@ de , gre@@ tel -- i was on a german exchange program then . &quot;
so she said , &quot; everybody in pal@@ est@@ ine , in where ? israel ?
cogni@@ tive psych@@ ologists now tell us that the brain doesn &apos;t actually see the world as it is , but instead , creates a series of mental models through a collection of &quot; ah@@ -@@ ha moments , &quot; or moments of dis@@ covery , through various processes .
down below here , we see call@@ s made by both mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es that also carry over very long ran@@ ges .
the other interesting thing for us -- we like sens@@ ors -- is this idea that you could have an on-@@ ra@@ mp for the internet of things .
suddenly , new chemical sta@@ ins for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first gli@@ mp@@ ses at brain wir@@ ing .
normally these are all part of the integr@@ ated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
i went down to be with a ran@@ ger plat@@ o@@ on on an operation in afghanistan , and on that operation , a ser@@ ge@@ ant in the plat@@ o@@ on had lost about half his arm thro@@ wing a taliban hand gren@@ ade back at the ene@@ my after it had land@@ ed in his fire team .
instead of invest@@ ing in a car , we invest in a community .
they can create a model inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously , because they &apos;re very emo@@ tive .
i car@@ ried on for another five or six stro@@ kes , and then i had nothing in my body , and i went down to the bottom of the lake .
this is dr. kan@@ g who &apos;s been working with us on this project , and part of our team .
there was no way we were going to get a s@@ ample from that .
we don &apos;t know anyone .
so , this , i think , is what the world needs now .
one has to be very spe@@ cul@@ ative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this spe@@ cul@@ ation , that we should simply keep our coun@@ sel until we know more .
quest diagno@@ stics and lab@@ cor@@ p , the two largest lab testing companies -- last year , they made prof@@ its of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respe@@ c@@ tively .
dar@@ win@@ ian natural sele@@ ction is so stun@@ n@@ ingly elegant because it sol@@ ves the problem of expla@@ ining complexity in terms of nothing but simpli@@ city .
that guy is going to eat all our she@@ ep .
so the story with z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
the hur@@ dy@@ -@@ gur@@ dy has been used , histor@@ ically , through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uni@@ qu@@ eness of the mel@@ o@@ dy combined with the ac@@ ou@@ stic bo@@ om@@ box here .
see , i grew up in be@@ th@@ le@@ hem , pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , the home of be@@ th@@ le@@ hem steel .
it was discovered by christ@@ ina hu@@ ff@@ ard and fil@@ med by sea studi@@ os , right here from monterey .
it &apos;s still not perfe@@ cted -- its coffee falls down -- so we still have a lot of work to do .
he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kis@@ s immediately , but to get a kis@@ s in three days .
it was probably one of my better ti@@ ra@@ des , i have some good ones , but this was probably one of my better ones . and i went into these people ; how could they take b@@ m@@ w &apos;s money , how could they have a ho@@ li@@ day for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; hon@@ ey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to mar@@ ry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; she was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a.@@ m. for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &quot; hon@@ ey , i can &apos;t tell you what this means . &quot;
now , this isn &apos;t going to be fre@@ ak@@ y .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
it &apos;s a universal thing -- we play .
and we even text at fun@@ er@@ als .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could ga@@ in , and know that when you see these people &apos;s fac@@ es that these are not just images of the la@@ kot@@ a ; they stand for all indi@@ gen@@ ous people .
and if i was to put money on it , i would put money on -- in a very uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic way -- that that these things would also cro@@ p up at the l@@ h@@ c .
islam actually , as a mon@@ o@@ thei@@ stic religion , which defin@@ ed man as a responsible ag@@ ent by itself , created the idea of the individual in the middle east and sa@@ ved it from the commun@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , the colle@@ cti@@ vis@@ m of the tribe .
and ide@@ ally , this is going to allow us to cat@@ ch these things early on , as they &apos;re moving over into human popul@@ ations .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
he was trying to work out how many ways you can recom@@ bine those 14 bits and still make a perfect square .
we was@@ h the bu@@ g out .
that &apos;s the kind of dedi@@ cation these people have .
and over the past few years , i think we &apos;ve been given a deep@@ er view of human nature and a deep@@ er view of who we are .
second one : can you light a little tor@@ ch-@@ bul@@ b with a battery bul@@ b and one piece of wire ?
but it turns out i was wrong , right ? because the ipod came out , and it viol@@ ated every bit of common wisdom .
and it &apos;s too cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l to anima@@ te gu@@ ts and he@@ arts and behavior when the going gets r@@ ough .
when oil was at sta@@ ke , somehow , suddenly , things mat@@ tered .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
so it felt this has a social dimension .
we are smart , in fact , we really are quite amazing , but we do love a good crisis .
so this little guy has found himself this bab@@ e , and you will note that he &apos;s had the good sense to atta@@ ch himself in a way that he doesn &apos;t actually have to look at her .
and some people think that str@@ ing theory is t@@ ough .
so i wrote at the top of the man@@ il@@ a fol@@ der , and i started looking at the data .
that &apos;s one big project .
very different reality . i used to live in chicago where there was ab@@ und@@ ant internet access .
you &apos;ll get a new syn@@ thesis .
and by day 20 , while he will be sc@@ ar@@ red for life , he will live .
so , in a way , the question is : on what grounds am i up@@ beat at all about history ? and the answer is , first of all , on balance i would say people have played their games to more win@@ -@@ win outcomes than los@@ e-@@ lose outcomes . on balance , i think history is a net positive in the non-@@ zero-@@ sum game de@@ part@@ ment .
and i remember@@ ed his son was in our force .
you see , there &apos;s a subtle e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te in the sk@@ ate park , and it &apos;s led by key influ@@ en@@ cers , and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks , or wear red pants , and on this day the mi@@ cs pi@@ cked that up .
even our near@@ est star , the sun -- its emissions suffer the tyran@@ ny of light speed .
so we &apos;ve asked all sorts of questions to see if we could un@@ do this finding .
it &apos;s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well .
so my whole picture of the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
whereas islam@@ ists and far@@ -@@ right organi@@ zations , for decades , have been building dem@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the gr@@ ass@@ roots .
it &apos;s the direct signal being recorded from my head , ren@@ dered in real time .
so took a running lea@@ p and jum@@ ped over the edge of a cli@@ ff .
but those aren &apos;t the important argu@@ ments .
it &apos;s a very soli@@ tary creature .
business should give more .
and amaz@@ ingly , that evolution susta@@ ins the tra@@ je@@ ctory that biological evolution had establi@@ shed toward greater complexity .
we so rar@@ ely look at the sky .
in@@ stances of pro@@ min@@ ent social and political fig@@ ures in poly@@ gam@@ ous relationships has led to the perception of poly@@ gam@@ y as a symbol of wealth , status and power .
not only that , but on top -- the life@@ blood -- that pl@@ um@@ bing system turns off every year or so .
meat , jun@@ k food , che@@ ese : the very stuff that will kill you .
and so what you &apos;re watching is the birth of stars .
there &apos;s one perman@@ ent steel ring at the top , but it can &apos;t be seen from any van@@ tage point on the mall .
and so the lec@@ ture moves on before , really , most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked .
in this se@@ tu@@ p , sch@@ rö@@ d@@ inger is in a box with a radi@@ o@@ active s@@ ample that , by the laws of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , bran@@ ches into a state in which it is radi@@ ated and a state in which it is not .
and he thought about using bin@@ ary . the problem with using bin@@ ary is that the machine would have been so t@@ all , it would have been ridiculous . as it is , it &apos;s enormous .
so each building has its own person@@ ality .
now , car@@ rying this thing around is complicated .
men , women and children of all ages , el@@ ders in wheel@@ cha@@ irs , have block@@ ad@@ ed the only road access to the inter@@ ior .
and as a result of this program , something &apos;s happening for conservation .
electr@@ ons bu@@ mble down the wire , about the speed of spre@@ ading hon@@ ey , they say .
and there is a lake scene in the south pol@@ ar region of ti@@ tan .
this instrument came up in those pictures . it &apos;s called the mouth bo@@ w .
how do you ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate all the scientific data around a product , the data that &apos;s changing on a wee@@ k@@ ly , if not a da@@ ily , basis ?
so , first i say , &quot; ma , why are we here ? &quot;
it &apos;s extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down , you see something that &apos;s quite extraordinary .
don &apos;t take on the cost that pre@@ v@@ ents you from getting to the contribu@@ tions of these people .
r@@ ory su@@ ther@@ land : now , naturally , a debate ra@@ ged .
and so i came up with the idea of the living self-@@ portrait series .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m just ap@@ pl@@ ying to pit@@ t for law school . &quot;
in dra@@ vi@@ dian languages , the word for fish is &quot; me@@ en &quot; which happens to sound just like the word for star .
all right , so why do i care about this ?
the mit project -- they were intervie@@ wing me for mit and they sent their facili@@ ties people to bil@@ ba@@ o .
throughout all of this , what i would ultimately realize was that each voice was clos@@ ely related to aspects of myself , and that each of them car@@ ried over@@ whel@@ ming emotions that i &apos;d never had an opportunity to process or res@@ ol@@ ve , memor@@ ies of sexual trauma and ab@@ use , of an@@ ger , shame , gu@@ ilt , low self-@@ worth .
and right now this is in the oka@@ van@@ go del@@ ta in bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a .
well how did that happen ?
we created the opposite of the diagno@@ stic man@@ ual of the ins@@ ani@@ ties : a clas@@ si@@ fication of the streng@@ ths and virtu@@ es that looks at the sex ra@@ ti@@ o , how they &apos;re defin@@ ed , how to diagnose them , what buil@@ ds them and what gets in their way .
i &apos;m going to talk today about saving more , but not today , tomorrow .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
now that &apos;s a left vent@@ ri@@ cle pushing blood up through the a@@ or@@ tic val@@ ve -- you can see two of the le@@ af@@ lets of the a@@ or@@ tic val@@ ve working there -- up into the as@@ cen@@ ding a@@ or@@ ta .
so this has important imp@@ lications both for fore@@ ca@@ sting and for policy .
for some reason , the car dri@@ vers are -- they are con@@ fi@@ dent they actually drive the same way that they used to do .
those machines go the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al jun@@ ky@@ ard .
it was a man called bri@@ an who runs a cra@@ ck team of sci@@ ent@@ ologists who are determined to destro@@ y psychiat@@ ry wherever it lies .
we have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions .
then i thought , &quot; i will go to the small scale industries facili@@ tating unit and ask help . &quot;
so here &apos;s a new definition for do@@ od@@ ling .
and we didn &apos;t really know what to do , so we called her into my office .
they also may be growing them . and we serve them in the caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as .
fif@@ teen seconds were suff@@ i@@ cient to have the two groups dis@@ close the same amount of information , as if the second group now no longer car@@ es for fac@@ ul@@ ty reading their answers .
so first i &apos;m going to show you the three-@@ year-old again .
and your eyes ...
now in an urban environment , that &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ arily difficult .
but then i got into stuff that i didn &apos;t love , like mana@@ gement . i am the world &apos;s worst mana@@ ger , but i figured i should be doing it , because i was , after all , the president of the company .
and this is the tropic@@ s .
this century there &apos;s a shift .
imagine -- i don &apos;t know , imagine a ho@@ g farm in , like , north carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and deci@@ des to stay .
sal@@ man rus@@ h@@ die was pis@@ se@@ d-@@ off i think because i alter@@ ed the map of new york , if you notice .
it &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
but some people bought a coffee for themselves , the way they usually would , but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else .
you might be able to look at brain activity and say , &quot; this person &apos;s going to be a good po@@ ker player , &quot; or , &quot; this person &apos;s soci@@ ally na@@ i@@ ve , &quot; and we might also be able to study things like development of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent brains once we have an idea of where this circu@@ it@@ ry exists .
it &apos;s a really big problem .
they &apos;re very useful in a violent op@@ pression .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
you hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology , or information technology ...
all easier said than done .
this is research -- can &apos;t buy it .
here &apos;s three quick ideas i came up with .
a guy who &apos;s ad@@ ded it up all this very well is david ma@@ ck@@ ay , a physi@@ c@@ ist in england , and in his wonderful book , &quot; sustainable energy , &quot; among other things , he says , &quot; i &apos;m not trying to be pro-@@ nuclear . i &apos;m just pro-@@ ari@@ thme@@ tic . &quot;
it turns out , because they &apos;re paid on contin@@ gency , it works really , really well in re@@ verse .
kb : thank you .
in fact , the average number of tos@@ ses till head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head is 10 and the average number of tos@@ ses until head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ tail is eight .
one last piece about this , of course , is that it &apos;s en@@ ab@@ led by wir@@ eless technologies .
i also didn &apos;t want anybody to question it .
once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
nm : that &apos;s a mos@@ qui@@ to wing beat you &apos;re hearing .
it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each contain@@ ing row upon row of c@@ ots , in each of which lay a child star@@ ing into space .
and so , i lived in k@@ ig@@ ali for about two and a half years , doing these two things , and it was an extraordinary time in my life .
and here he &apos;ll explain a little bit about what it does .
each of these ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical colum@@ ns would produce a note .
and , approach@@ ing a building from a distance , you don &apos;t see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arri@@ ve at a nice little com@@ position that might re@@ mind you of a mon@@ dri@@ an or a di@@ eben@@ kor@@ n or something .
12@@ th if i was to go back to iraq and speak to the people , i &apos;d have to bo@@ w down and kis@@ s their feet .
and something else happened instead .
so in order for all this to work , obviously i have got to be in a position of trust .
you need to know that the average patent tro@@ ll defen@@ se costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
and then there &apos;s dan e@@ tete .
nobody call@@ s her dis@@ ab@@ led .
there are a number of techni@@ qu@@ es to harv@@ est rain .
k@@ ent lar@@ son : brilliant designs to fit more people in every city
this is my favorite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
that &apos;s a was@@ ps &apos; nest .
they can kill three million in chicago tomorrow and we don &apos;t go to the mat@@ tr@@ esses with nu@@ kes .
i didn &apos;t do all that well in psychiat@@ ry in medical school , but i was interested , and i think this was seriously del@@ u@@ sion@@ al .
and so we can send out sound wa@@ ves , they boun@@ ce off objects like fish and are refle@@ cted back .
thank you very much .
what a genius , what a professional .
did you note there , that we have mexico up there ?
so what &apos;s new in it ? what seems to be very new , which is the idea i would like to share with you today , that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to per@@ form successful non@@ violent strug@@ gle .
they p@@ ine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
and my grand@@ father , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing i had . i didn &apos;t play spor@@ ts .
we figured out how to put a v@@ ap@@ or@@ -@@ comp@@ res@@ sion dist@@ il@@ ler on this thing , with a counter@@ -@@ flow heat ex@@ chan@@ ger to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 4@@ 50 watts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 g@@ all@@ ons an hour of dist@@ ill@@ ed water from anything that comes into it to cool it .
take o@@ bi@@ ang j@@ uni@@ or . well , he didn &apos;t end up with high-@@ end art and lu@@ x@@ ury houses without help .
so just like the breast cancer story , doing research , getting a@@ war@@ eness going , it works , you just have to get it going .
no one taught her to b@@ end this into a ho@@ ok , had shown her how it could happen .
and it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to figure out .
okay , i hear you were laugh@@ ing nerv@@ ously because you too could hear that the dri@@ ll was a little bit shar@@ p , the in@@ ton@@ ation was a little questi@@ on@@ able .
that one is , more or less , the same type of process .
we were expe@@ cting new particles and new phenomena ac@@ compan@@ ying the higgs bos@@ on .
here &apos;s another big idea : co2 as a feed@@ stock .
but not to create the engineering colle@@ ges .
michael pa@@ w@@ l@@ yn : using nature &apos;s genius in architecture
between australi@@ a and here , right , they &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night , and then rush back again ? i mean , it &apos;s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields .
so repli@@ c@@ ating food , taking it into that next level is where we &apos;re going .
and this spe@@ a@@ ks to the role of angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is in reg@@ ul@@ ating healthy set points .
you want to do .
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is rap@@ ed when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is bl@@ amed for that .
and the thing about their fur@@ ni@@ ture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good h@@ ost , anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating the needs of the gu@@ est .
of course , the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 , so there was no real dan@@ ger to our democratic processes .
because &#91; if &#93; to have the best results , you really needed the most expensive care in the country , or in the world , well then we really would be talking about ration@@ ing who we &apos;re going to cut off from medi@@ care .
for a few days , they transformed a massive city into a community where end@@ less possibility rei@@ g@@ ned .
what kinds of people would join a global community wel@@ coming people from every discipline and culture , who se@@ ek a deep@@ er understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
if you &apos;ve heard about the may@@ an 2012 ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ se , you &apos;re going to hear about ap@@ op@@ his , because you &apos;re ke@@ yed in to all the do@@ om@@ s@@ day networks anyway .
this yo@@ un@@ gest of seven had to get her@@ self to the front of the line .
then , i don &apos;t look it , but i was the indian national squ@@ ash ch@@ amp@@ ion for three years .
the usual suspe@@ cts , like satur@@ ated fat and su@@ gar , ni@@ cot@@ ine , op@@ i@@ ates , co@@ ca@@ ine , too much al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and chron@@ ic stress .
they asked this question .
and so that ti@@ ght community is who really car@@ es for the site , and these are some of the smar@@ test people i &apos;ve ever met .
so that &apos;s what we were doing .
i mean , this could be huge .
intro@@ version is more about , how do you respon@@ d to stimulation , including social stimulation .
and it just takes a quick , quick second .
their cli@@ ents aren &apos;t happy , and people go hun@@ gry .
but he actually talks to , has two-@@ way ex@@ changes with , about four to six people on a regular base , depen@@ ding on his gender .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it pe@@ a@@ ks in early ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence .
used to do their christ@@ mas card every year .
now that was , ir@@ on@@ ically , and very be@@ fit@@ t@@ ingly , the way we found his grave .
don &apos;t worry about dro@@ pping it , it &apos;s tou@@ g@@ her than titan@@ i@@ um .
they &apos;re paid as employees of project h to be the construction cre@@ w with us to build these projects in the community .
now , with all of my optimism , and i am an opti@@ mist , comes a healthy d@@ ose of cau@@ tion , or rather , an urgent need to address some pres@@ sing , complex questions .
so every single year that you are boo@@ sting your four types of resili@@ ence , you &apos;re actually ear@@ ning .@@ 12@@ 8 more years of life or 46 more days of life , or 6@@ 7@@ ,@@ 2@@ 9@@ 8 more minutes of life , which means every single day , you are ear@@ ning 18@@ 4 minutes of life , or every single hour that you are boo@@ sting your four types of resili@@ ence , like we just did together , you are ear@@ ning 7@@ .@@ 6@@ 8@@ 24@@ 5@@ 8@@ 3@@ 7 more minutes of life .
completely mechan@@ ical . this whole machine is mechan@@ ical .
a cas@@ ual impul@@ se , a fan@@ cy , never thought of until now , har@@ dly thought of even now ...
there is nothing on the other side .
so , we tried it .
i read it three or four times and i think , &quot; is he really end@@ or@@ sing intelligent design ?
as barbara de@@ pic@@ ted in one of her amazing movies , &quot; y@@ ent@@ l , &quot; she portra@@ yed a young woman who wanted an education .
and so i wonder@@ ed , could what the future be@@ ck@@ ons for india to be all about be a combination of these things al@@ lied to something else , the attra@@ ction of india &apos;s culture , what , in other words , people like to call &quot; so@@ ft power . &quot;
the study went viral on the internet and it attra@@ cted a lot of attention from the international media .
in india , poor women are learning english faster than their male counter@@ parts in order to staf@@ f the new call centers that are growing in india .
you can start anywhere , this time i ch@@ ose earth .
so you got rid of the body shop .
it &apos;s a my@@ ster@@ y !
and i started watching k@@ ak@@ i king a lot , and she would always ci@@ te pre@@ ston reed as a big influence , so then i started watching his videos , and it &apos;s very sur@@ real right now to be -- was that piece just now , that was one of his son@@ gs that you learned , or how did that happen ?
it didn &apos;t matter who did the cho@@ os@@ ing , if the task was di@@ c@@ tated by another , their performance suff@@ ered .
humans , without fin@@ s : 90 meters , 3@@ .@@ 5 minutes .
and they &apos;re still with us , and you haven &apos;t solved them , and i haven &apos;t heard anybody here speak to that .
but i know i needed to .
i challenge you to try . it &apos;s very hard .
one of my first bat@@ tali@@ on com@@ man@@ ders , i worked in his bat@@ tali@@ on for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with l@@ t@@ . mc@@ chr@@ ystal was at mile 18 of a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ mile road mar@@ ch , and he che@@ wed my ass for about 40 seconds .
what about the political system ?
well , many theor@@ ies . but how could something t@@ ie them together ?
but that wasn &apos;t what the media businesses wanted .
so many people come up to me now and say , &quot; what &apos;s next ? we love that !
j@@ on@@ as ben@@ di@@ k@@ sen , a very ener@@ ge@@ tic photographer , came to me and said , &quot; we need to docum@@ ent this , and here &apos;s my pro@@ pos@@ al .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institu@@ tional dem@@ ands for hospitals , sen@@ ior centers , schools , da@@ y@@ care centers , and produce a network of regi@@ onal jobs , as well .
now some of you here look a bit ast@@ on@@ ished by that number , but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental ill@@ n@@ esses , from auti@@ sm and intellectual dis@@ ability in childhood , through to depression and anxi@@ ety , sub@@ stance mis@@ use and psych@@ osis in adul@@ tho@@ od , all the way through to de@@ men@@ ti@@ a in old age , and i &apos;m pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person , at least one person , who &apos;s affected by mental ill@@ ness in our most inti@@ mate social networks .
what kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then lab@@ el it and sell it to children ?
it &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is ti@@ ming .
a@@ thei@@ sm shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sour@@ ces of religion .
although we can &apos;t bring trees and pra@@ ir@@ ie plants and fro@@ gs into these environ@@ ments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
so i think of -- we &apos;re kind of going from the out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right , library stuff , and amaz@@ on@@ .com is coming from the in-@@ print world .
but this is a simple signal , and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .
it &apos;s going to be very challenging to deal with .
anyway , so the biggest thing that &apos;s invisible to us is what we don &apos;t know .
a be@@ ard full of be@@ es .
we &apos;ve been working on democra@@ ti@@ zing lincoln center for a public that doesn &apos;t usually have $ 300 to spend on an opera ti@@ cket .
now often , a result of cap@@ gras syndro@@ me is tra@@ gic .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
in here , i have produce and boxes that are un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
and there are some brilliant lingu@@ ists , mostly russi@@ ans , who are working on that , at santa fe institute and in mos@@ cow , and i would love to see where that leads .
11 million aids or@@ ph@@ ans in africa , 20 million by the end of the decade .
sure , the web conne@@ cts the glo@@ be , but most of us end up hearing main@@ ly from people just like ourselves . blog@@ ger and technolog@@ ist e@@ than zu@@ cker@@ man wants to help share the stories of the whole wide world . he talks about cle@@ ver strategi@@ es to open up your twitter world and read the news in languages you don &apos;t even know .
one is in the south and in the west of india , which is already going to be fully expen@@ sed by 2015 , because in that part of the country , the ferti@@ li@@ ty rate is almost equal to that of a west european country .
but , you know , we thought , well , it &apos;s at least 9@@ 5 percent right or 99 percent right .
the phr@@ ase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an empi@@ ri@@ c@@ ist .
and the link to ap@@ h@@ ro@@ dis@@ i@@ a@@ c .
and then also graph@@ s by scientists , this beautiful dia@@ graph of protein hom@@ ology .
and the other one , of course , is don@@ ald ru@@ m@@ s@@ feld , who said , &quot; there are the known know@@ ns , the things we know we know .
one of the families i intervie@@ wed for this project was the family of dylan k@@ leb@@ old who was one of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of the colum@@ bine mas@@ sac@@ re .
this was an epi@@ ph@@ any . we came to understand and to pro@@ ve that the brown co@@ ating that we see today was not done by le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da vin@@ c@@ i , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
and that is , you don &apos;t put water into a le@@ ak@@ y bu@@ cket .
and so what we can do is we can lay out the fra@@ mes side by side or stack them up .
this was after kat@@ r@@ ina . we were the first commercial fle@@ et of air@@ plan@@ es to be clear@@ ed into the dis@@ aster impact zone .
thank you very much .
the ner@@ ds here , they get la@@ id -- except for the lady with the con@@ dom@@ s in her po@@ cket -- and you say to yourself at some point , &quot; am i part of this group ? like , am i into this ? &quot;
that &apos;s ri@@ o .
so if we each do our part , together , we can make a difference , and we can help keep pengu@@ ins from going extinct .
another three years .
it &apos;s always what it was and what it can be .
there &apos;s a very simple institu@@ tional technology which can transform that , and it &apos;s called ver@@ i@@ fied au@@ ctions .
because for so long i &apos;ve been standing on the si@@ del@@ ines content to be a wit@@ ness , just taking photographs .
how small can neurons get ? well , look at this interesting inse@@ ct .
i work with a special i work with pre@@ cisi@@ on -- oh , sorry -- control and a very powerful ...
we need to organize around it . &quot;
and then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagn@@ osis , and then prescri@@ bes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glas@@ ses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree .
i dr@@ ap@@ ed them cas@@ ually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
the ar@@ row shows you the long axis .
well , we don &apos;t really know , but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress . it &apos;s 26 million vol@@ umes , 26 million vol@@ umes .
br@@ ent law@@ son : happy to be here .
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
and for the first , i don &apos;t know , three to five years of their life , mountain bikes were known as &quot; cl@@ un@@ kers . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , you know , that might be a bit ambi@@ tious for our budget . &quot;
in this moving talk , docum@@ ent@@ ary photographer kri@@ sten ash@@ burn shares un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able images of the human impact of aids in africa .
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sex@@ y foot forward .
sub@@ sequ@@ ent re@@ visions of the agre@@ ement were facili@@ tated by the british and ir@@ ish governments , who never wa@@ ver@@ ed in their determin@@ ation to bring peace and st@@ ability to northern ireland .
the important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if , this is a question of when , and how big .
my sister is ch@@ asing someone else . it &apos;s not me .
the cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later .
the most expensive grid power in the world is thous@@ and@@ ths of that .
you have to have low cost , but you also have to have a function .
in fact , that is three months solid x-@@ ra@@ ying .
other countries come with different things .
if you ask people va@@ gue questions , like , &quot; do you think there should be more government or less government ? &quot;
bru@@ g@@ ger and his colleague , christ@@ ine mo@@ hr , gave subje@@ cts l@@ -@@ dop@@ a .
i wanted to become a teacher .
what does that mean , my environment ?
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and un@@ expe@@ c@@ ted@@ ly pi@@ cked up .
not very many of you .
and let me redu@@ ce this to the simpl@@ est level .
the ice is always moving , bre@@ aking up , dri@@ f@@ ting around , re@@ free@@ zing , so the sc@@ ener@@ y that i saw for ne@@ arly 3 months was unique to me . no one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the vie@@ ws , the vi@@ st@@ as , that i saw for 10 weeks .
and every one of these has been sub@@ sequ@@ ently bl@@ amed on lar@@ ge-@@ body impact .
you know , we look at running as this kind of alien , foreign thing , this pun@@ ish@@ ment you &apos;ve got to do because you ate pi@@ zz@@ a the night before .
she said , &quot; well , i work for a company called he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pack@@ ard . &quot;
driving a car is a -- is a really em@@ power@@ ing act for a young child , so this is the ultimate .
bio@@ chem@@ ist gre@@ g@@ ory pet@@ sk@@ o makes a convin@@ cing argument that , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll see an epidemic of neuro@@ logi@@ cal diseases , such as alzheimer &apos;s , as the world population ages . his solution : more research into the brain and its fun@@ ctions .
let &apos;s re@@ mind ourselves that cells are not an abstra@@ ct concept .
and we made this small movie that i &apos;d like to show .
and development just basically going ber@@ ser@@ k , for a double figure growth index , basically .
so , doing these arti@@ ficial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-@@ living and living systems .
most of these are can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
further advan@@ ces came when the team re@@ moved the restri@@ ction enz@@ y@@ me genes from the reci@@ pi@@ ent cap@@ ri@@ col@@ um cell .
now , it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other .
we found some goo@@ ey material that had the right extra@@ c@@ ell@@ ular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and beh@@ old , in about four days , they got re@@ organi@@ zed and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
and we want to tell our grand@@ children that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stun@@ ted , but that exists no more .
you all know that crazy system , six days in hell , you get the se@@ vent@@ h day free .
he would hold on to the recei@@ ver and expect me to di@@ al a number for him .
we o@@ we an incredible de@@ bt of gra@@ titude to these two women .
compu@@ tation only exists relative to consciousness .
and the number we end up with -- that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 -- is to do with how likely one of those explan@@ ations is relative to the other .
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .
let &apos;s have the next video . this shows the other end of the spectrum .
but the effect is rela@@ tively small .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufac@@ tur@@ er .
you will hear about los z@@ et@@ as , the kni@@ ghts tem@@ pl@@ ar , which is the new brand for the famili@@ a mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ ana that i spo@@ ke about at the beginning , and the sin@@ alo@@ a fe@@ der@@ ation .
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
i have my cli@@ ents . i am doing my work like i always did .
but it &apos;s important to understand that a lot of the orig@@ ins of our industries -- even like henry ford -- come from this idea of playing and fig@@ uring things out in groups .
and you have to say , &quot; mama , humanity is my business . &quot;
it &apos;s not true . authority , in fact , is essenti@@ al to freedom .
so it &apos;s a tree , and in its tr@@ unk you have the roots of languages .
and that , that man@@ eu@@ ver called &quot; crisis m@@ apping , &quot; was ki@@ cked off in kenya in j@@ an@@ u@@ ary of 2008 .
here &apos;s some re@@ con@@ struc@@ tions of some of the fossi@@ ls that have been found from lake tur@@ kan@@ a .
air@@ por@@ ts around the world are lo@@ cated on the co@@ ast .
and then , before you get together , agree on some ground rules .
now , our environment is in@@ und@@ ated with evidence .
that &apos;s why i am here , to try to do it the best possible .
i &apos;m not talking about nor justi@@ fying people taking other people &apos;s content in wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale and distribu@@ ting it without the per@@ mission of the copy@@ right ow@@ ner .
and the professional , historical lingu@@ ists in the u.@@ s .
i said , &quot; i have no idea . &quot;
when i started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations . ma@@ z@@ el to@@ v .
and there &apos;s a patent pen@@ ding on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
we changed their ability to judge other people &apos;s actions .
she was be@@ aten every single day by her husband , who was un@@ emplo@@ yed .
em : it was a close call . things almost didn &apos;t work out .
now it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story -- that &apos;s powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
well , char@@ ity became their answer .
and the old one looked like this .
so this means that , with each euro he invest@@ ed , he was able to move 26 euro@@ s of market value through the cha@@ in of ow@@ ner@@ ship rel@@ ations .
so if you want to build a human from dna origami , the problem is , you need a long str@@ and that &apos;s 10 trillion trillion bas@@ es long .
i &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
we all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
another thing is , sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone , they are bigger than the phone itself .
so we then look starting with two afri@@ c@@ ans , looking at the two african genom@@ es , finding places where they diff@@ er from each other , and in each case ask : what is a ne@@ anderth@@ al like ?
in one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immen@@ sely sti@@ ff and strong it is .
nervous , i went down to the street to look for her .
a couple of years ago i was hi@@ king near co@@ dy , w@@ y@@ om@@ ing .
in 194@@ 7 , there was no wind tun@@ nel data beyond mach 0@@ .@@ 85 .
the obvious question here is , does a tedtalk really need 2,@@ 300 words ?
well it &apos;s hard to say .
i think it has to start with us .
they begin to be attra@@ cted towards earth .
when you &apos;re looking around , what do you consider ?
so over time , time and space have comp@@ res@@ sed because of this .
all big societies that have governments , and where most people are str@@ an@@ gers to each other , are ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably similar to each other and different from trib@@ al societies .
but when you &apos;re blind , you have the tac@@ tile memory for things .
and a team has now just been able to m@@ im@@ ic that hydro@@ gen-@@ ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing hydro@@ gen@@ ase .
ah . so it &apos;s not necessarily just the performance .
a transfor@@ mation is coming which needs to be understood by the human@@ it@@ arian structures and human@@ it@@ arian models .
you were separated from your family by the state .
now i have be@@ aten a song back into you .
i feel that i &apos;ve fit@@ ted in , in many ways , to some of the things that i &apos;ve heard .
and the brain started to fold in on itself , and that &apos;s why the ne@@ o@@ cortex is so highly con@@ volu@@ ted .
and kinder@@ garten was actually a very form@@ alized system of education , establi@@ shed by a man named frie@@ dr@@ ich fro@@ e@@ bel , who was a cr@@ yst@@ allo@@ grap@@ her in the 19@@ th century .
and your instin@@ ct is to say , &quot; why don &apos;t you su@@ ck an eg@@ g ? &quot;
need@@ less to say , i was dra@@ st@@ ically wrong .
this is a picture of a gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos pengu@@ in that &apos;s on the front of a little zo@@ dia@@ c here in the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
and so by thinking of this as a person@@ nel system , we can do it much better .
and i want to begin sharing these evil things that i &apos;ve been doing with you , starting with my mor@@ n@@ ings .
and the ga@@ g is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
the reason you &apos;re trying to understand why they ha@@ te us , is to get them to qu@@ it hat@@ ing us . the idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them , is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run .
but now , notice there are two ways of seeing the cu@@ be , right ?
fa@@ st-@@ forward 50 years , and bell and watson &apos;s technology has completely transformed global communications .
and he said , &quot; wait a second , that &apos;s what i do . &quot;
if you want to attra@@ ct people like ju@@ ander@@ son who could , for instance , buy guns , wear je@@ wel@@ ry , ride mot@@ or@@ bikes and get girls through the drugs trade , and you want to attra@@ ct him into education , having a comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um doesn &apos;t really make sense .
to give you a perspective , if i had to translate the propor@@ tion of psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in the population that one might see in britain to india , one might expect roughly 15@@ 0,000 psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in india .
and now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
now , because i know -- -- ok , i assu@@ me that answers my question .
gar@@ re@@ tt hard@@ in used it to talk about over@@ population in the late 196@@ 0s .
just to give you grounds for compar@@ is@@ on , rice : 3@@ 5,000 genes .
that &apos;s now the state we &apos;re in with these collaboration tools .
and then finally , in terms of driving , there &apos;s the issue of the sing@@ le-@@ largest killer of healthy adults , and one of the largest kill@@ ers of all people , is car crash@@ es .
now , how do we analy@@ ze sam@@ ples like this one that con@@ tain more plastic than plan@@ kt@@ on ?
what is that ? it &apos;s an an@@ tivi@@ ral defen@@ se enz@@ y@@ me .
and so far , with the support of world wild@@ life fund , we &apos;ve been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .
and just the sales of the products -- this is a non-@@ profit -- the sales of these products is now .@@ 6 % of the g@@ dp of kenya .
and so i came up with a life box , because i needed a deli@@ very system .
of course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world -- i would certainly agree .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the fa@@ vor .
some ideas i &apos;ve had is like , look , the reality is -- kids in the south bronx need ap@@ ples and car@@ ro@@ ts and so do kids in bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a .
i mean , in those days it was the domain of the physici@@ sts .
during his time at the american museum of natural history , andre@@ ws led a range of expe@@ di@@ tions to un@@ char@@ ted regi@@ ons , like here in the go@@ b@@ i desert .
&quot; mom , i want to make maps . &quot;
you see , the first time , he was playing with an impul@@ se on every note .
so to me this is interesting and important , and in fact , it &apos;s my policy , even though i give a lot of talks to adults , you give talks to adults , and two days later they &apos;re back where they were .
but basically , the reason why i make to@@ ys like this is because i think if there &apos;s one difference i could possibly make in the world , that i would choose to make , it &apos;s that i would like to somehow give people just a little bit better c@@ ali@@ bra@@ tion on long-@@ term thinking .
and i would say , if it doesn &apos;t have to be , then maybe it shouldn &apos;t be .
in 197@@ 8 , i was working for time magazine , and i was given a three-@@ day as@@ sign@@ ment to photograph amer@@ asi@@ an children , children who had been fa@@ ther@@ ed by american g@@ is all over sou@@ the@@ ast asia , and then ab@@ and@@ oned -- 4@@ 0,000 children all over asia .
your own thing , not personal property , my property , every time .
but if you now look at the same distribution in english tex@@ ts , it looks like that .
the pro@@ ta@@ gon@@ ists of this story are a young woman , r@@ ose m@@ ap@@ en@@ do , and her children .
our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years .
this guy also li@@ ked pla@@ in water and the muscle rela@@ x@@ ant .
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
a couple weeks later their b@@ oss , frank mc@@ cl@@ ure , pul@@ ls them into the room and says , &quot; hey , you guys , i have to ask you something about that project you were working on .
and if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you .
and then the surprise turns into hope .
it &apos;s not a dinosau@@ r ; it &apos;s a whale , animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean .
do you believe that as human beings -- i &apos;m not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings , it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation ? &quot;
the dark blue here is sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa .
so , when you &apos;re listening to it@@ un@@ es and your favorite music , that &apos;s really just a bunch of ones and zer@@ os playing very quickly .
it seems like they &apos;re everyone &apos;s de@@ fau@@ lt do@@ om@@ -@@ and-@@ glo@@ om metaph@@ or .
they had become one , pushing me to triumph .
are we going to make them auto@@ matically join the plan , or are they going to be left out ?
and through the children is usually the way to go .
so , in fact , an@@ atom@@ ically , it is correct .
but authority is not enough to make people your part@@ ners .
so low income here , high income there .
well , it en@@ ables you to drink coffee .
no scientist could predict that in 2007 , suddenly , what could be crossing a threshold .
markets have changed beyond recogni@@ tion in the last 20 years , but only for organi@@ zations at the top of the economy .
right ? it &apos;s not what it says it is . it &apos;s not really the magic k@@ ing@@ dom .
they &apos;re there because there &apos;s this very close interaction .
and it was a prototyp@@ e . and a month and a half later , i come back to swi@@ tzer@@ land , and there he is playing with his own version .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve a@@ ging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scratch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
she makes about two dollars a day , is creating an education fund , and told me she is not mar@@ rying nor having children until these things are comple@@ ted .
but ice has another meaning .
you can use software like google sket@@ ch@@ up to create products from scratch very easily .
i want to d@@ well in that light with you and with everyone .
it is due to usa &apos;s continu@@ ous sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ing during 25 years of the very good metho@@ d@@ ology for measuring child mortality that we have a gras@@ p of what &apos;s happening in the world .
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the br@@ ush in their self-@@ portrait .
and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point .
all right , let &apos;s take a look at the long one first , okay ?
it &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
they &apos;ve already ga@@ ined experience from rais@@ ing their own children .
it was a tanz@@ ani@@ an team talking to the villa@@ gers , asking what they were interested in .
what this is now is a real simulation . that &apos;s what i want to show you now .
fifth ... from my childhood , fifth we were having fun , bi@@ king .
trade walls began to come tu@@ m@@ bling down .
can you imagine this five-@@ foot@@ -@@ two woman , standing up to men with guns who want to kill us ?
but we don &apos;t just do that either .
why did we set up these experiments ?
and he asked me several questions , of which many were , &quot; why ?
how do you know ?
you know , back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cos@@ m@@ op@@ oli@@ tan : if you were a guy and you wanted to im@@ press a girl , you could take her out on a cho@@ p su@@ ey date .
t : i want to change my life !
i was meeting with a group of new@@ l@@ y-@@ ele@@ cted par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ari@@ ans from egyp@@ t and tun@@ isi@@ a a couple of weeks ago .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nur@@ ses , and we are physi@@ cally getting ex@@ hau@@ sted to see all of them .
and the kind of social network i &apos;m talking about is not the recent online variety , but rather , the kind of social networks that human beings have been assem@@ bling for hundreds of thousands of years , ever since we emer@@ ged from the african sa@@ van@@ nah .
and once again , we &apos;ve been building great relationships among them just since we &apos;ve been re@@ he@@ ar@@ sing .
the lesson we learned out of this is , scan your own books .
i am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facili@@ ty -- which i do .
whole different paradigm -- transi@@ stors came out of the woo@@ d@@ work .
levi@@ a@@ than force , it &apos;s all about jo@@ in@@ t oper@@ ations between the military services .
it &apos;s not just these modern buildings which suffer .
but there &apos;s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was establi@@ shed .
now this is a very well-@@ ob@@ served and well-@@ establi@@ shed notion for behavior change .
pretty much everybody else who does poll@@ s .
so i want you to imagine a world , in 20@@ 50 , of around nine billion people , all as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing to western in@@ comes , western li@@ fest@@ y@@ les .
and the only fis@@ her@@ y left -- and it is a commercial fis@@ her@@ y -- is the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish fis@@ her@@ y you see on the right , where there used to be pra@@ wns .
but i see that people are coming along , that the au@@ dien@@ ces , para@@ do@@ x@@ ically , are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are .
now there are la@@ yers of technical wonder behind sites such as sw@@ ap@@ tree , but that &apos;s not my interest , and nor is swa@@ p tra@@ ding , per se .
we speci@@ alize in high-@@ quality facial animation for video games and fil@@ ms .
to this end , the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of ex@@ hibi@@ tions , all ti@@ tled with an f -- fre@@ est@@ yle , frequency and flow -- which have set out to dis@@ cover and define the young , black artists working in this moment who i feel stron@@ g@@ ly will continue to work over the next many years .
you want to know more about this , go and see this film , &quot; doing time , doing vi@@ pas@@ san@@ a . &quot;
but nothing else does either .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing ar@@ ray of sens@@ ors : your phone , your cre@@ d@@ it card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually pres@@ ents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
we went to home de@@ pot well over a hundred times .
there were all the parents sitting in a par@@ king lot eating food out of the back of their car -- only the english -- eating their sau@@ sages . they loved their sau@@ sages .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the isra@@ el@@ i fla@@ g .
it works .
the west may collapse very suddenly .
another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very op@@ en-@@ ended .
that doesn &apos;t move .
but i want to give you a reality check .
this animal &apos;s going to go to the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side and po@@ ke his n@@ ose there , and he gets a f@@ lash of blue light every time he does that .
it was a very big deal for her to become director .
gradu@@ ally it would shift from a politics of pl@@ under to a politics of hope . thank you .
a girl named nat@@ sum@@ i even approach@@ ed miss s@@ mit@@ h as she was leaving the room and tu@@ g@@ ged on her sk@@ ir@@ t and asked , &quot; could you please tell my mom@@ my i did it just like she said ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you take the contro@@ ls , and you fly towards that mountain . &quot;
and it fle@@ w in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them .
and you need to put some new in@@ cisi@@ ons in there .
and the bal@@ in@@ ese car@@ pen@@ ters want to be as modern as we do , so they use met@@ al sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding to build the b@@ am@@ bo@@ o building and when the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding came down , we realized that we had a ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l , a ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l to green , and a ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l to green education .
well , you create your own teachers .
but knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depres@@ sed .
i then began to cho@@ ke , and then it quickly led to me v@@ om@@ iting in the water .
if he had ki@@ cked a dog , i would have pun@@ ched him out .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an edge of the amazon , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one far@@ mer out there in the middle of the pri@@ me@@ val jung@@ le .
when winter weather set in , the temperat@@ ures dropped below free@@ zing . and they sta@@ yed there .
and we found it right over here three seconds ago -- the previ@@ ous one , six seconds ago .
you see , businesses are not run as institutions , by the i@@ di@@ osy@@ n@@ cr@@ as@@ ies of individuals .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upp@@ er body .

and then when we zo@@ om@@ ed into this , it &apos;s like a ver@@ it@@ able universe .
so , how war@@ m or cold do you feel about , you know , native americans , or the military , the republi@@ can party , the democratic party , all sorts of groups in american life .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , i didn &apos;t want to see that . &quot;

every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
i &apos;m sorry if i put that idea in your head .

two stunt guys doing what i consider to be a rather ben@@ ign stunt .
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot didn &apos;t it ?
it makes less sense that an emo@@ tion that was built to prevent me from in@@ gest@@ ing poison should predict who i &apos;m going to vote for in the up@@ coming pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
can@@ di@@ dat@@ es for congress and members of congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time rais@@ ing money to get back to congress or to get their party back into power , and the question we need to ask is , what does it do to them , these humans , as they spend their time behind the tele@@ phone , calling people they &apos;ve never met , but calling the tin@@ i@@ est sli@@ ce of the one percent ?
it was made to play hawa@@ i@@ ian music back in the 19@@ 20@@ s , before they had electric gu@@ it@@ ars , trying to make a loud gu@@ it@@ ar .
i repli@@ ed that surely this was a case of mista@@ ken identi@@ ty because i &apos;m as far as you can get from being an ath@@ le@@ te .

we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .
in addi@@ tion to the supply le@@ vers that we can push , and remember , we need large amounts , because at the moment , we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fu@@ els .
when i was 11 , i wanted to be left alone .
so , that &apos;s for bed nets . so you will think , &quot; that &apos;s great .
and , in princi@@ ple , it could &apos;ve gone on forever , with perfect ce@@ li@@ bac@@ y on the part of the ho@@ sts .
again , it &apos;s useful to make an analo@@ g@@ y to reading and writing .
i like that .
so let &apos;s start . number 10 : we lose the will to survive .
indeed , i was the yo@@ un@@ gest me@@ mber of any dele@@ g@@ ation in the 19@@ 80 conven@@ tion that ele@@ cted r@@ on@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an to be the republi@@ can nom@@ ine@@ e for president .
it &apos;s called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescri@@ be solutions to improve health , not just man@@ age disease .

most important thing is : only you can change yourself , and only you can change the world and make it better , for people as well as pengu@@ ins .
now , there &apos;s one way to interpre@@ t this , which is to say that &quot; e@@ man@@ ci@@ p@@ ation &quot; and &quot; depression &quot; and &quot; recovery &quot; all have a lot of sy@@ ll@@ ables .
my mother wanted me to be a den@@ ti@@ st .
its initi@@ al version was sk@@ ill@@ fully medi@@ ated by sen@@ ator george mit@@ ch@@ ell .
we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clo@@ thing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on .
and if tem@@ pers are still too high , then they send someone off to visit some rela@@ tives as a cool@@ ing-@@ off period .
and it sounds sil@@ ly , but that &apos;s basically what we do .
and so i was able to calcul@@ ate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
sa@@ y@@ y@@ id qu@@ t@@ b is one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of fan@@ a@@ tical islam , one of the ide@@ olo@@ gu@@ es that inspired os@@ ama bin laden .

and this r@@ out@@ ine went on for some time .
how many people knew of l@@ ul@@ a before today ?
you can &apos;t actually build much on a ro@@ of , they &apos;re not designed for that .
so , the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um becomes satur@@ ated with the oil , and then , when we re@@ turned six weeks later , all the tar@@ ps were re@@ moved , all the other pil@@ es were dead , dark and stin@@ ky .
that &apos;s just 12 percent of the population .
and yet it &apos;s only the re@@ tin@@ al information that we get .
your brain is learning . and it &apos;s learning that the right side of its visual field is under red ill@@ um@@ ination ; the left side of its visual field is under green ill@@ um@@ ination .
you &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on subsi@@ dies .
are they inter@@ connected ?
a well-@@ designed video game will se@@ am@@ less@@ ly wea@@ ve the user into the fabri@@ c of the virtual experience .
these drugs were brought to market . they were prescri@@ bed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we dete@@ cted that safety signal , over 10@@ 0,000 people died un@@ necessarily in america from the prescri@@ ption of anti@@ -@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drugs .
the rat is an entire organis@@ m , after all , with inter@@ acting networks of organs .
when we started par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma we had no idea which direction we were taking .
i don &apos;t really even know what ja@@ ke is talking about after that , but you notice that he &apos;s changing the topic .
so al-@@ bat@@ ina is hidden , but she &apos;s a super@@ hero .
so dan demon@@ str@@ ates the many self-@@ lear@@ ners who take this course off the web , on their own tra@@ ction , on their own initiative , and it &apos;s quite amazing because these people cannot care less about gra@@ des .
and also showing o@@ y@@ ster gar@@ den@@ ing for the community along its ed@@ ges .
all right , so it &apos;s a de@@ lic@@ ate dance .
and so something we kind of knew , but you didn &apos;t actually notice syn@@ tac@@ tically what he was doing .
so i have one message .
somebody don@@ ated 20 cents online .
it gets way better .
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the united states stock market , 70 percent of the oper@@ ating system for@@ mer@@ ly known as your pen@@ sion , your mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge .
you &apos;re not asked .

but they can do pretty amazing things , too .
during the first two re@@ bel@@ li@@ ons , they killed all animals in the zo@@ o .

if you give something to a char@@ ity or to the public , you get a p@@ at on the back and a ta@@ x don@@ ation -- except on the net , where you can go broke .
this consciousness , though , was a little slow to se@@ ep through the general population , even people who were very , very well infor@@ med .
the plan was to give you a portrait of n@@ oll@@ y@@ wood , of this incredible film industry , following bon@@ d in his quest to make an action movie that de@@ als with the issue of corruption , called &quot; che@@ ck@@ point . &quot;

i went up to the front of the tank , and he &apos;s just star@@ ing at me , and he had little hor@@ ns come up above his eyes .
each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was st@@ ated by somebody , an image , a news story , a person , a company . you know , some kind of hero@@ ic person@@ ality .
this is star@@ bucks , you know .
the key is in the red zone .
photographer phi@@ l bor@@ ges shows rar@@ ely seen images of people from the mountains of d@@ har@@ am@@ sal@@ a , india , and the jun@@ gles of the ecu@@ ad@@ or@@ e@@ an amazon . in docum@@ enting these en@@ danger@@ ed cultures , he inten@@ ds to help preser@@ ve them .
in fact , on that other side is the area , tor@@ a bor@@ a , the area where os@@ ama bin laden &apos;s supposed to be . this is the trib@@ al area .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your sp@@ ouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
and this is also again showing us what we can do .
if it &apos;s more being tr@@ apped on the way out , then you would expect it to be war@@ mer here and cool@@ er here . here is the lower atmosphere .

sea levels are rising , and kiribati , along with 4@@ 2 other nations in the world , will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated se@@ a-@@ level rise from ther@@ mal expansion and the mel@@ ting of fres@@ h@@ water into the ocean .
and so you can see , the real process of -- and this is bac@@ ked up by this 50@@ 0-@@ page book -- that the auth@@ orities came down and citizens got up .

why would you want to do that ? &quot;
there is trade , there is dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment , there is cros@@ s-@@ bor@@ der rel@@ ations .
and this is quite interesting , to find evolutionary orig@@ ins of visual signals on what &apos;s really , in all species , their spring .
but one of the first things they needed to do was ass@@ ess what i needed right away .
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
it tells the story of sputnik , and the story of what happened to america as a result .
which is , you go onto a stage . there is an orchestr@@ a sitting .
i &apos;m very , very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by the fact that our cars and trucks sit i@@ d@@ le 90 percent of the time : they &apos;re par@@ ked , they &apos;re par@@ ked all around us .
you &apos;re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this technique -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cen@@ tered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
i sold newsp@@ ap@@ ers .
and with a $ 20 billion price tag , we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what &apos;s in front of us .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop will@@ power .

you make it flow under and over .
neurosci@@ enti@@ st and inv@@ ent@@ or chri@@ stop@@ her de@@ char@@ ms demon@@ str@@ ates a new way to use f@@ mri to show brain activity -- thou@@ ghts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . in other words , you can actually see how you feel .
this is an mri mr@@ a mr@@ v , a volu@@ me@@ tri@@ c mri .
why have our breast cancer ch@@ ari@@ ties not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our hom@@ eless ch@@ ari@@ ties not come close to en@@ ding hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness in any major city ?
love them . they just sell us what we want . all right .
there &apos;s a world bank , arms de@@ al@@ ers and a united nations .
i mean , i &apos;d thought about the h@@ arb@@ our bridge or bon@@ di be@@ ach , but m@@ into ? but still , i &apos;m a produ@@ cer , and the l@@ ure of a si@@ te@@ -@@ specific theater project was more than i could res@@ ist .
that &apos;s going to spra@@ y cells over that area .
so , if i know how fast it goes around , i know the mass .
we &apos;re los@@ ing a ritual .

these are logi@@ stics elements that are sc@@ at@@ tered across the united states .
the ni@@ tro@@ gen has two problems .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women .
and whatever the shor@@ t-@@ run price for taking action on climate change or taking action on security , or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education , these are pri@@ ces that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries .
i thought , &quot; god , here we go . we &apos;re , we &apos;re -- this is all or nothing . &quot;
it was v@@ ener@@ able .
so what happens if the big brain in the integration over@@ ri@@ des the signal ?
it keeps me bus@@ y .
and it came down to something called g@@ out , which , as a result of ki@@ d@@ ney break@@ down is actually u@@ ric ac@@ id cr@@ yst@@ als throughout the body , and worse in the jo@@ in@@ ts , which made the gh@@ ari@@ al un@@ able to swim .
and when i was 10 , i was told that my parents left because they didn &apos;t want me .
it turns out , by the way , our girls are little stal@@ ins .
and i was an ar@@ che@@ olog@@ ist , and then i broke things .
he stood over six feet t@@ all .
and the ideas are very dis@@ par@@ ate .
this is still the way we &apos;re communic@@ ating messages about health .
and most of all , in the way that we f@@ ought for democracy .
i am going to talk about myself , which i rar@@ ely do , because i -- well for one thing , i pre@@ fer to talk about things i know nothing about .
so it &apos;s syste@@ mic across the entire country .
but when we began to bring more money , when we began to invest more resources , things got worse , not better . how ?
it &apos;s just because people are un@@ comfortable with the idea , and that &apos;s why i want you today to try to think about this , think about the benefits of be@@ es in cities and why they really are a terri@@ fic thing .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colon@@ ize the mil@@ ky way .
you might take states like i@@ o@@ wa and o@@ hi@@ o -- two very important political states , by the way -- those two go@@ ver@@ nor@@ s , and they would say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in producing the wind tur@@ bin@@ es and the wind energy .
that &apos;s the sun at that end .
using those intellectual fil@@ ters , we eli@@ min@@ ated &#91; 7@@ ,@@ 9@@ 6@@ 2 . &#93; we were left with 3@@ 8 chemicals .
i was a little nervous performing without animation , co@@ stu@@ me -- really -- and ma@@ ke-@@ up .

we &apos;re last place in europe in innovation .

and now in the middle of this surgery , the surgeon is ra@@ cing against the clo@@ ck to finish his case , which he can do -- he &apos;s got a head@@ lam@@ p .
so , what we &apos;ve got -- some people say , &quot; oh , it doesn &apos;t matter very much because , actually , treatment is effective pre@@ vention because it lo@@ wers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to trans@@ mit hiv . &quot;

it &apos;s h@@ ul@@ king , it &apos;s sil@@ ent , it &apos;s clo@@ ist@@ ered , it &apos;s arro@@ gant , it &apos;s a design challenge .
so , when the vis@@ it@@ ors come , mars wal@@ ks up to the computer , starts typ@@ ing &quot; h@@ ello , my name is mars . &quot;

in the 19@@ th century , it was a cor@@ ru@@ pt poli@@ tician .
and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this .
in the year of my birth the n@@ inten@@ do enter@@ tain@@ ment system also went into development .
what &apos;s going on there ?
tech joy , to me , means something , because i get a lot of joy out of tech .
they just move back to the mi@@ d-@@ east and those come back .
they &apos;re very big prin@@ ts . but this is how i get to that object .
i &apos;ve been car@@ rying on here about the biology of love .
ari@@ el : i have made you ma@@ d .
so even if somebody made the small@@ po@@ x genome , that dna itself would not cause infe@@ ctions .
pol@@ ar be@@ ars are amazing h@@ unter@@ s .
as we age , our time hori@@ z@@ ons grow shor@@ ter and our goals change .
it &apos;s ti@@ tled &quot; the inno@@ cents . &quot;
i was che@@ cking mine . i couldn &apos;t find everything , but i noticed you had something here .
i had to ho@@ ok it up to a computer , so i couldn &apos;t just train it anywhere .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
and the answer is yes .
over time , those gas mole@@ cul@@ es dis@@ solve into your blood and tissues and start to f@@ ill you up .
we would gl@@ ue a piece of py@@ re@@ x or he@@ at@@ -@@ resist@@ ant glass in front .
i think it &apos;s the only pre@@ ce@@ dent in which money has ever been stopped from being used .
he had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
so , i continued to work on this project of how photograph@@ y se@@ du@@ ces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter .
and it works .
she thought i &apos;d gone off my head .
so what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
two out of three ate the marsh@@ mal@@ low .
and this is the 16 centi@@ meter area .
they used the same tr@@ ash to form green man@@ ure .
you know ? if you want to know what i &apos;m made of , let &apos;s look at me . &quot;
and so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory virus chip .
n@@ al@@ ini na@@ d@@ kar@@ n@@ i : con@@ ser@@ ving the canopy
is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ?
why are we doing all of these mis@@ sions and why are we exploring them ?
no lo@@ ot@@ ing , no military disappe@@ aring , no arms disappe@@ aring , no am@@ m@@ o disappe@@ aring , no mu@@ q@@ ta@@ da al-@@ sad@@ r -- i &apos;m wre@@ cking his b@@ ones -- no insur@@ gency .
a tor@@ r@@ ent of pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er social networks and re@@ al-@@ time technologies , fundament@@ ally changing the way we be@@ have .
it was such a high labor compon@@ ent to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market .
i &apos;ve found , after doing this for many , many years , that there &apos;s a magi@@ cal world behind reality .
and then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go . right .
and , as many people do , he was do@@ zing off during the ser@@ mon .
it &apos;s basically talking like you write , and so , for example , we &apos;re thinking so much these days about lincoln because of the movie .
and one of the most common fac@@ es on something fac@@ ed with beauty , something stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly deli@@ cious , is what i call the om@@ g .
so there are striking simil@@ ari@@ ties , i think , to the internet bo@@ om , right ?
the large ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der , a partic@@ le physics acceler@@ ator , that we &apos;ll be turning on later this year .
now , this plant is an ar@@ tem@@ isi@@ a plant ; it &apos;s the basic compon@@ ent for arte@@ mis@@ in@@ in , which is the best@@ -@@ known treatment for malaria .
and so i think that we &apos;re going to see over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years a real science of creativity that &apos;s bur@@ ge@@ oning and is going to fl@@ our@@ ish .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the bre@@ ath .
and then this is a film , on the lower left , that charles and ray made .
so i was in the prison . &#91; &quot; n@@ sa@@ wan prison &quot; &#93; now , what you are seeing is a pi@@ le of dead bodies .
but i suspe@@ ct even the non-@@ radi@@ ologists in the room can find the tumor on the mb@@ i image .
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn &apos;t necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not &quot; in the dna . &quot;
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the for@@ es@@ ight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tom@@ e .
kap@@ lan would later describe me as &apos; wri@@ thing in ag@@ ony . &apos; even in this state , what he accur@@ ately descri@@ bed as ac@@ u@@ tely and for@@ war@@ dly psycho@@ tic , i ref@@ used to take more medi@@ cation .
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot;
you can bring large objects into the ch@@ am@@ ber itself .
it would take me a month to sho@@ ot a four@@ -@@ minute roll of film , because that &apos;s all i could afford .
and if she &apos;s doing that , because every time she cros@@ ses that tar@@ get with the little cur@@ s@@ or , she gets a drop of bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an orange ju@@ ice .
so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity , this extraordinary volunte@@ er response to this animal crisis was pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly moving and a@@ we@@ -@@ inspi@@ ring .
and this is how you look at africa .
one hundred thir@@ t@@ y-@@ four com@@ mis@@ sions and se@@ mi@@ -@@ auton@@ om@@ ous government bodies , all of which have dire@@ ctors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addres@@ sed to mr. bono . in his work , he may help us on this .
and so , i became convinced that it is this syste@@ matic corruption which is per@@ ver@@ ting economic poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making in these countries , which is the main reason for the miser@@ y , for the poverty , for the confli@@ cts , for the violence , for the des@@ per@@ ation in many of these countries .
and tor@@ osau@@ rus , when we cut into it , has ma@@ ture bone .
okay .
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the le@@ sters is going to produce a subtle , under@@ st@@ ated , we could say cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged , ben@@ ding to keep the le@@ sters happy .
but we really made sure we tested those ro@@ vers before we got them down -- or that ro@@ ver -- and made sure that it &apos;s all working well .
in this case , we only used 15 of the 60 acr@@ es of land , and the 45 acr@@ es was a park and would become the leg@@ acy of the olymp@@ ic village .
and third , it had to be what am@@ it@@ ab@@ ha call@@ s infin@@ itely exp@@ and@@ able .
i don &apos;t think so , because it happens , not all that often , but there are a variety of examples that point the way .
but what they do have is incredible social skills .
they don &apos;t want to feel like they need to take a sho@@ wer to get the moral gri@@ me off their bodies everyday when they come home from work .
and you &apos;re on the inside , and it &apos;s everything you hop@@ ed it would be .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
they work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand , because your hand mus@@ cles are still there .
we &apos;re going to call him &quot; ted . &quot;
so , finding life on another planet is a non-@@ tri@@ vi@@ al occup@@ ation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that .
so , in 199@@ 8 , along with my ment@@ ors don bur@@ ke and colon@@ el mp@@ ou@@ di@@ -@@ n@@ g@@ ole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with h@@ unter@@ s in this part of the world .
so he &apos;ll take , say , fal@@ c@@ on skin cells , fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , turn it into indu@@ ced plu@@ ri@@ pot@@ ent stem cells .
i connected high speed internet to it -- it &apos;s about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there .
but there is a section of the patri@@ ot act which ref@@ ers speci@@ fi@@ cally to fin@@ ance .
all right , all right .
and the mor@@ tal self was the girl that walter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh was sent , and gradu@@ ally he separated her so she was free to be di@@ v@@ ine .
i think people have been ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the wrong question , which is , &quot; how do we make people pay for music ? &quot;
the challenge is , that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be north american , might not be western european .
and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expe@@ cts of you .
and then when you sh@@ ine light on the entire network , just that cell type will be ac@@ tiv@@ ated .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be ar@@ re@@ sted , so he supp@@ lied everybody with this fa@@ ke volunte@@ er card .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
what we do is we get a great big pol@@ ari@@ zation filter , pop the be@@ et@@ le under@@ ne@@ ath it , and the filter is at right an@@ gles to the pol@@ ari@@ zation pattern of the sky .
this is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology .
trying to change them by enga@@ ging in male circum@@ cisi@@ on .
and here i am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is hiv positive and we &apos;re sm@@ iling , both of us are sm@@ iling , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is recei@@ ving treatment so her life can be exten@@ ded to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
but reach@@ ing 500 million people is much , much tou@@ g@@ her .
the moment kids start to lie is the moment stor@@ y@@ telling begins .
i look at even my family .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or span@@ ish , or french .
per@@ se@@ us flying to the res@@ cu@@ e of and@@ ro@@ me@@ da .
fran@@ k@@ ly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic ja@@ m with no emissions is still a traffic ja@@ m .
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as or@@ ku@@ t and also google news .
and you have charles bon@@ net syndro@@ me .
successful innovation is not a single break@@ through .
also , people like myself , we &apos;re fighting two bat@@ t@@ les on different grounds .
i want to look now , if i may , at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxi@@ ety about our care@@ ers .
by the time i was 18 , i had a deep passion for books .
because the longer i deal with these problems , the more convinced i am that we have to -- whether it &apos;s economics , health , education , whatever -- we have to build systems .
for example , right now we can put their own sig@@ nature whist@@ les in the computer and requ@@ est to interact with a specific dol@@ ph@@ in .
you couldn &apos;t see it from the street , because the home was surrounded by be@@ ech trees .
but one of the most extraordinary is ro@@ tary international .
now you can probably make it , but it &apos;s going to be a pretty fli@@ m@@ sy appar@@ at@@ us i think .
for example , this shrimp rele@@ ases its bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ cent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an o@@ ct@@ op@@ us would rele@@ ase an in@@ k cloud .
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ i@@ mal level , like this tiny mani@@ p@@ ulation , this tiny intervention ?
i mean , those battery pac@@ ks are incredibly heavy , but you think the math can still work out intelli@@ g@@ ently -- by combin@@ ing light body , heavy battery , you can still ga@@ in spectacular effi@@ ci@@ ency .
we &apos;re using a planet &apos;s worth of land already .
it seemed that for our neigh@@ b@@ ors and friends , africa was either this ex@@ otic place , this imag@@ in@@ ary land that probably exists only in their imagination , or the place of hor@@ ror , fam@@ ine .
so we thre@@ w in -- we created a pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al sou@@ p with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars , with motors , with neurons .
so they decided -- i didn &apos;t know this , again , i found this out later -- that the only thing that could be done was for this 4@@ 3@@ -year-old man to have a pre@@ -@@ frontal lo@@ bot@@ om@@ y .
but you &apos;ve managed to talk yourself into that .
eight years later , when they discovered there was a p@@ lot to kill him , they dres@@ sed him up like a beg@@ gar and s@@ nu@@ ck him out of the country on hor@@ se@@ back , and took the same trip that tam@@ d@@ in did .
it means soldiers are not needed to pat@@ ro@@ l our streets .
we start with just one green , and as it inter@@ acts it gains wealth or points or food .
they &apos;re not going to die of hypo@@ ther@@ mi@@ a .
what about the orig@@ ins of agriculture ?
so i think in clos@@ ing , sort of in the im@@ mor@@ tal visions of the new yorker magazine , i thought i &apos;d put up one more slide .
if we &apos;re only focused on how to maxim@@ ize i think we risk supp@@ res@@ sing this different and ri@@ cher and , in some ways , maybe even more important one .
but the guy , here , on the right , he &apos;s doing the stre@@ tch .
that &apos;s 10 percent of the co2 emissions across their entire country .
and when you look at the map now po@@ sted on the ushahidi front page , you can see that the number of dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ments in ushahidi has gone worldwide , all right ?
they were a per@@ v@@ asive presence .
but when it comes to govern@@ ance of the global space , my guess is this won &apos;t happen through the creation of more u.@@ n. institutions .
we met her in a hospital in the eastern cap@@ e and spent a whole after@@ no@@ on with her -- an ad@@ or@@ able child .
i wanted my old life back . i wanted my body back .
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have fro@@ zen .
a couple years ago , i was in south africa on sa@@ far@@ i .
also , we do it in order to share with other people .
and then you can high@@ light it into something like , yes , cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing@@ .@@ or@@ g .
and so , an@@ u@@ j and ac@@ u@@ men have been talking about testing the priv@@ ate sector , because the assu@@ mption that the aid establi@@ sh@@ ment has made is that , look , in a country like tanz@@ ania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
this is the number of dist@@ in@@ ct people that have helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ cap@@ tch 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge .
it &apos;s bal@@ e@@ en . moving on .
it &apos;s a living reli@@ c of the dist@@ ant past .
and they had a can@@ ary hung inside the thing to make sure the ger@@ man@@ s weren &apos;t going to use gas .
after that , and some previ@@ ous vol@@ can@@ o@@ es we have , you see a quite dra@@ matic cool@@ ing of the atmosphere .
and the last is that these b@@ old , new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet , our oceans , and eventually how we man@@ age probably the entire planet , for what it &apos;s worth .
and when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the wa@@ y@@ side .
we &apos;re talking about an object that you could cr@@ ush down to half the square area of manhattan .
we have le@@ sters from everywhere . we could think , &quot; what could we do to make le@@ ster@@ land better ? &quot;
paul mac@@ cre@@ ady : nature v@@ s. humans
it passed directly through earth &apos;s orbit . we were in that that spot six hours earlier .
we need to get over our fear of how extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful we can be in each other &apos;s lives .
everyone wants to hear their news an@@ ch@@ or say , &quot; mi@@ ster sp@@ las@@ h@@ y pants . &quot;
one of the fascinating things about what we were actually working on is that we were seeing , using new kinds of scan@@ ning technologies , things that had just never been seen before -- i mean , not only in disease mana@@ gement , but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you mar@@ vel .
the creation of a cor@@ por@@ ation , science , the university , eventually the industrial revolution , and it was all good .
i &apos;ve gone too far . so that sounds like it &apos;s it .
they had expe@@ c@@ tations for all of the cousins and the exten@@ ded family of im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts that lived in the south bronx , but they had more than just expe@@ c@@ tations for us .
you &apos;ve figured out an un@@ known location of a satellite or@@ bit@@ ing the planet from a known location on the ground .
in my graduate years i worked with my colleague and ment@@ or and friend , steve schnei@@ der , at the national center for atmos@@ pher@@ ic research , working on global change issues .
so that &apos;s the beauty of having a tumor that &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed with flu@@ ores@@ cent mole@@ cul@@ es .
every country — ir@@ ani@@ ans , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
you know , a couple of years this thing isn &apos;t going to be here .
and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest .
in the last year ?
the chinese did over a million , and the egyp@@ ti@@ ans are about 3@@ 0,000 .
the adult liter@@ acy rate in china is 7@@ 7 percent as compared with 4@@ 8 percent in india .
j yeah . and you know , i &apos;m a com@@ ba@@ tive person , so i &apos;m not actually so big on the nur@@ ture , but some way -- there is another way of nur@@ turing victi@@ ms , which is to police per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of crime .
and so the media industries beg@@ ged , in@@ si@@ sted , dem@@ anded that congress do something .
and in particular , every single one of the major world tradi@@ tions has high@@ ligh@@ ted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what &apos;s become known as the gol@@ den rule .
they depend on us for their survival .
these foreign fi@@ gh@@ ters had left their families in the gulf , the le@@ vant and north africa to join al q@@ a@@ e@@ da in iraq .
that &apos;s the potential of the ab@@ ra@@ ham path .
in fact , if i &apos;m feeling down , i just go to broad@@ way in down@@ town o@@ a@@ kl@@ and , in no time at all .
but not just work . it &apos;s within these tri@@ bes that societies get built , that important things happen .
and here i &apos;m showing a picture that was in wi@@ red magazine -- you know , the arti@@ facts of the future section that i love so much -- that shows you can have your des@@ k@@ top 3d prin@@ ter and print your own bas@@ ket@@ ball .
now not being a drug company , we could do certain things , we had certain flexi@@ bilities , that i respect that a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical industry doesn &apos;t have .
we feel that this is an important gest@@ ure .
dig@@ g is a commun@@ al dynamic to try to find and source the best news , the most interesting stories .
so in summer 2000 i was the first to base jump the ei@@ ger north face in swi@@ tzer@@ land .
i can refle@@ ct it in the line through x , or the line through y , or the line through z .
so , for example , rat@@ s are incredibly responsive bre@@ e@@ ders .
i guess you can only have one mi@@ ra@@ cle per building .
but in fact he was the person who was most sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to the oxygen .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
in the normal human mind language cover@@ s up the visual thinking we share with animals .
but i think he will change his mind soon .
and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day .
most of the social rules and the metho@@ ds of work are left completely op@@ en-@@ ended in the software .
the challenge is to see how to har@@ ness them for human pur@@ pos@@ es .
you think , well it &apos;s been up , it &apos;s been down , its been up , it &apos;s going to keep on going up and down .
and if you compare light energy to musical sc@@ ales , it would only be one oc@@ ta@@ ve that the na@@ ked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
so people there are eating them , not because they &apos;re hun@@ gry , but because they think it &apos;s a de@@ lic@@ acy .
her body was ri@@ dd@@ led with secon@@ dar@@ y tu@@ mor@@ s .
but i ask you today , what would you do if you had to choose ?
and there are many clinical trials .
sort of lea@@ der@@ ship by hu@@ mili@@ ation .
that lawyers who repres@@ ent death row in@@ mates have shif@@ ted their focus to earlier and earlier ch@@ ap@@ ters of the death pen@@ al@@ ty story .
he has com@@ pla@@ ined a lot about people cop@@ ying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city .
and even those people who com@@ pla@@ in and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pis@@ a is just an arti@@ fact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty of societies , and so on , these people must now con@@ ce@@ de that education impro@@ v@@ ement is possible .
and when they get really happy about this , we go ahead and sty@@ mie them .
you can see shanghai , korea , singap@@ ore in asia ; fin@@ land in europe ; canada in north america doing really well .
it just dro@@ ps them , the shor@@ test distance possible , to the forest flo@@ or , where they &apos;re actually up@@ cycl@@ ed into next year &apos;s top@@ soil .
we went back and looked at where these particular tex@@ ts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the indu@@ s valley .
because the last 20 years , the som@@ ali woman has stood up .
and in fact , what did happen to my brain ?
since the late 199@@ 0s , increases in produ@@ ctivity have been de@@ cou@@ pl@@ ed from increases that means that our countries are getting ri@@ cher , our companies are getting more efficient , but we &apos;re not creating more jobs and we &apos;re not paying people , as a whole , more .
di@@ ver 2 : ho@@ o !
so we are working now on a non-@@ inv@@ asive -- again , these are all inv@@ asive studies .
they would have been gone if we &apos;d kept that up one more year .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
thank you very much .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
you know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attra@@ ction and so forth .
and once you have a very , very large budget , you actually look for expensive things to spend it on .
what is unbelie@@ v@@ ably ir@@ on@@ ic is the period that we tried to de@@ pic@@ t in the film , the cr@@ y for democracy and social justice , repe@@ ats itself now again in te@@ hr@@ an .
good people could be se@@ du@@ ced across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could re@@ cover with help , with reform , with re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation .
so , what we &apos;re going to do is that we &apos;re going to measure a few basic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters on you , including your pul@@ se rate and the amount of oxygen that &apos;s there in your blood .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
slightly em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing ad@@ mission : even when i was a kid , i used to have these little sp@@ y books , and i would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neigh@@ bor@@ hood and lo@@ g it down .
and we do this in many ways . we work with many different hospitals .
we k@@ ick them , we hit them , we drop them , just to make sure we understand how , where would they break .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
in different con@@ tex@@ ts , cells do different things .
i made them into groups of four .
and at least , you know , in my case , because if i just do one thing all the time , i don &apos;t know , i get very , very bor@@ ed . i bor@@ e very easily .
be@@ ver@@ ly + der@@ e@@ ck j@@ ou@@ bert live in the bush , fil@@ ming and photograph@@ ing li@@ ons and le@@ op@@ ards in their natural hab@@ it@@ at . with st@@ unning foot@@ age , they discus@@ s their personal relationships with these ma@@ je@@ stic animals -- and their quest to save the big cat@@ s from human thre@@ ats .
against the current ! you did it against the current !
it is not about docum@@ entation and con@@ tra@@ ct .
under a different load , it &apos;s a different structure . and you can actually explo@@ it that by putting in a very small number of condu@@ cting fi@@ bers to actually make it a sens@@ or .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
that , and i will say this to the scientists , that the trick@@ ster has the ability to hold his ideas ligh@@ tly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the con@@ tradi@@ ctions or the hidden problems with his ideas .
a so@@ matic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gest@@ ated in the ov@@ um of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a gu@@ ar .
what happens , actually , is there is two air mas@@ ses .
so , this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower pri@@ mates .
so information that organi@@ zations are spending economic effort into con@@ ce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good -- because the organi@@ zations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to con@@ ce@@ al it .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn &apos;t get from training cour@@ ses .
so that &apos;s how the idea came about .
and some say this was the start of a global movement .
they have money and power .
ar@@ ab countries not so much , but iran is quite high .
if fibon@@ acc@@ i had been on pa@@ x@@ il , that would be the fibon@@ acc@@ i series .
you know , anybody who &apos;s read a children &apos;s book knows that love makes things real .
just one eye , looking at you , and eli@@ min@@ ating everything else about a face , but just to consider ga@@ ze in an is@@ ol@@ ated way as a kind of , as an element .
the money came in basically over@@ night .
and business investment in ge@@ ar , in equipment and hardware and software is at an all-@@ time high .
and it inclu@@ des some fis@@ h@@ es as well .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you , whether they are environmental , technological , animal , or human .
and as soon as she me@@ ets a hal@@ f-@@ th@@ ai , hal@@ f-@@ can@@ adi@@ an young guy from e@@ din@@ burgh , she recogni@@ zes him as k@@ in .
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simpl@@ est form of life found .
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other enti@@ ties that are also static and stuck , but which cr@@ y for change and dynam@@ ic@@ ism , and one of those enti@@ ties is our pris@@ ons .
j@@ ose ant@@ on@@ i@@ o ab@@ re@@ u : the el si@@ ste@@ ma music revolution
and we are evolution@@ arily designed to do vision .
but , at the same time you don &apos;t want to get so focused on rule number two , or goal number two , that you ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct goal number one .
so we &apos;re ne@@ aring the end of our conversation and the end of dinner , and i &apos;ve decided steve the i.@@ t@@ . guy and i are really just not meant for each other , but we &apos;ll part ways as friends , when he gets up to go to the ba@@ th@@ room , and in the mean@@ time the bill comes to our table .
sharks were still killed up into the mi@@ d-@@ 8@@ 0s , especially after places like dun@@ more east in coun@@ ty wat@@ er@@ ford .
and this del@@ ta water flows to mobile bay , and finally into the gulf of mexico .
so much of london &apos;s meat was coming from the nor@@ th@@ west , from scot@@ land and wal@@ es .
these are tiny differences , but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity .
because , again , i think that when i am aware of them , more of them happen .
sha@@ ff@@ i ma@@ ther : a new way to fight corruption
wel@@ come to africa ! or rather , i should say , wel@@ come home .
and he never does .
and the national tv station was in@@ jun@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : in@@ jun@@ ction land@@ ed on the news des@@ k , and the news rea@@ der was like , &quot; this has never happened before . what do we do ? &quot;
you can &apos;t stop it .
but our question really was , do our non@@ verb@@ als go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves ?
recent u.k. leg@@ is@@ lation could be used in the same way .
so if you keep further down the knowledge map , we &apos;re getting into more advanced ari@@ thme@@ tic .
it &apos;s part of your life .
but fortunately , it also works the other way around .
and here &apos;s the simple version of a foot for a new robot that i &apos;ll show you in a bit .
you can draw from this .
it &apos;s all incredibly hum@@ ble material .
so where does it take us ?
the smo@@ oth st@@ ones on the sand are familiar to us .
we wanted to know how much better we could do .
it doesn &apos;t have the same reson@@ ance for us that the ar@@ c@@ tic national wild@@ life re@@ fu@@ ge has , but it should , i mean , it &apos;s a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
i am more excited than most people , as a neurosci@@ enti@@ st , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental ill@@ ness and even maybe to make us better and smarter .
&quot; it &apos;s going to transform your organization . i don &apos;t want to tell you about it now , but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto ? &quot; so i fle@@ w here , met down on front street east , and we sat in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om , and i said , &quot; right , here &apos;s my vision of getting men growing mu@@ sta@@ ches all across canada rais@@ ing a@@ war@@ eness and fun@@ ds for your organization . &quot;
i think there &apos;s -- i don &apos;t know what data would im@@ press you , but how about , 43 percent of the re@@ fin@@ ed fuel produced in the world is consu@@ med by cars in me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan areas in the united states .
but to build a fire , you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up , and eventually you can add the lo@@ g to the fire , it bur@@ ns , but it bur@@ ns slowly .
it &apos;s no longer the go@@ ds , it &apos;s us . we &apos;re in the driving seat .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
and you can see that , in a developing society that was beginning to acqui@@ re language , not having language would be a like a bird without w@@ ings .
so this would just be one more choice among millions of internet for@@ ums .
i bought a tra@@ ctor -- then it broke .
i &apos;m saying that the capacity for self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence is just a basic part of being human .
it &apos;s difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second .
i have a scale model here .
and for that i am very grat@@ eful .
are people getting smarter or du@@ mber ?
they kept telling us , &quot; tell the truth ! &quot; as they beat us .
and most contro@@ versi@@ ally , it means the t@@ ar s@@ ands .
so today , i &apos;m here to actually give you a first gli@@ mp@@ se of what the new teles@@ cope , ke@@ pl@@ er , has been able to tell us in the last few weeks , and , lo and beh@@ old , we are back to the har@@ mon@@ y and to ful@@ fil@@ ling the dreams of c@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus .
i separated this image into cy@@ an , mag@@ ent@@ a , yellow , black , the basic printing colors , and then mixed up the separ@@ ations , and you get these pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar pictures .
this is a graph demon@@ str@@ ating the presence of publi@@ cation bi@@ as in studies of publi@@ cation bi@@ as .
wow . well done .
and i &apos;d like to show it .
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .
if we change these things , if we pay attention to these things , and we re-@@ enga@@ ge boys in their learning , they will leave the el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary schools saying , &quot; i &apos;m smart . &quot;
yeah , that was a hard one . i couldn &apos;t find a way to ti@@ dy that up proper@@ ly , so i just decided to make it a little bit more simpler .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
it &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a desert island .
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like w@@ ine , be@@ er and yog@@ urt .
his pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what &apos;s going on , but he says , &quot; let &apos;s get this kid &apos;s genome sequ@@ enced . &quot;
then the money they get , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their to@@ y account .
people don &apos;t know we lau@@ gh . when i did the axis of evil com@@ edy tour , it came out on com@@ edy central , i went online to see what people were saying about it . i ended up on a conserva@@ tive website .
our own mil@@ ky way galaxy is rich in this kind of planets .
because gps doesn &apos;t work under water . that &apos;s why we need these tools .
it &apos;s the way i got a part of this ro@@ mance .
this is just one example .
i took a couple vi@@ ctory l@@ aps in there .
they were changing shape .
i have questions with the values of new@@ ton@@ ian science , like ration@@ ality . you &apos;re supposed to be rational in an argument .
1.@@ 1 million of them .
&quot; great -- got it . &quot;
now for 20 years , t@@ ort re@@ form@@ ers have been so@@ unding the al@@ arm that law@@ su@@ its are out of control .
we should record it . &quot;
a message to the enter@@ tain@@ ment industry and to the press : on the whole , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job fighting stig@@ ma and pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce of many kinds .
but if it &apos;s taught proper@@ ly , it can be a lot of fun .
we were actually recor@@ ding history .
audience : you had , i hope you had -- ed : now you &apos;ve been to the website do@@ gs of sa@@ in@@ t louis in the late , in the mi@@ d-@@ 19@@ 30 &apos;s , then you &apos;d know that was a great dan@@ e .
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to st@@ um@@ ble upon .
so we &apos;re using an enormous amount of land for agriculture , but also we &apos;re using a lot of water .
and i could see my father : &quot; yeah , he really is crazy . &quot;
it just means ordinary or common .
this is a low-@@ al@@ titude photograph that i made showing our di@@ ve boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
if you have to work in an op@@ en-@@ plan office like this , your produ@@ ctivity is great@@ ly redu@@ ced .
so , that gives you an idea of the te@@ ct@@ on@@ ic events or vol@@ can@@ ic events which have happened on that planet .
so &quot; design as education &quot; means that we could actually teach design within public schools , and not design@@ -@@ based learning -- not like &quot; let &apos;s learn physics by building a rocket , &quot; but actually learning design@@ -@@ thinking cou@@ pl@@ ed with real construction and fabri@@ cation skills put towards a local community purpose .
it cli@@ m@@ bs up to the top , and it falls , and it cli@@ m@@ bs , and it falls , and it cli@@ m@@ bs -- trying to stay at the very top of the bla@@ de of gr@@ ass .
the middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves .
and i call this my &quot; year of speaking danger@@ ously . &quot;
all you have to do is play with it , change it a little bit , and come up with something that does help , that does work .
this is a very em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing talk , i know .
after the big mach@@ o &quot; rr@@ rr@@ rr@@ r b@@ am ! we &apos;re gon@@ na hit this thing in the face , &quot; then we bring in the vel@@ v@@ et glo@@ ves .
this sugge@@ sts that the same script , the indu@@ s script , could be used to write different languages .
so you &apos;re six years old , you &apos;re reading s@@ now white and the seven d@@ war@@ ves , and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world : d@@ war@@ ves and prin@@ ce char@@ m@@ ings .
the stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic .
never mind that i had no idea what g@@ inger be@@ er was .
that &apos;s another killer app .
and when i was teaching , i used to always ask the students , what &apos;s the definition of a good job ?
it &apos;s a pre@@ -@@ competi@@ tive issue .
steven john@@ son : the web as a city
and he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to for@@ age and pro@@ vision at a pi@@ le of dry dung p@@ el@@ lets .
and it made me think -- and i &apos;ll just note for the record -- one word that i &apos;ve only heard once actually was when we were all doing tony rob@@ bins yog@@ a yesterday -- the one word that has not been mentioned in this semin@@ ar actually is the word &quot; friend . &quot;
and we should be proud of where our power is coming from , rather than something we are necessarily ash@@ amed of .
and it was a pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ olog@@ ist , the late louis le@@ ak@@ ey , who actually set me on the path for studying ch@@ impan@@ ze@@ es .
&quot; what &apos;s the matter ? the pe@@ ar@@ ls of wisdom le@@ ap@@ ing from my li@@ ps like lemm@@ ings is no good for you ? &quot;
and these are actually micros@@ cop@@ ic ; you need a micros@@ cope to see these .
then one plus two is three , two plus three is five , three plus five is eight , and so on .
and because of the social connections , chinese students coming el@@ sewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening off@@ ices in china -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little .
they created a global computer made up of people .
so the important point here is the right hand always does the same things -- sin@@ us@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ al movement .
you &apos;re hearing one pres@@ entation after another , often repres@@ enting a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
this is the most glam@@ or@@ ous picture , i think , ever .
so what we discovered is that ab@@ ra@@ ham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about ex@@ por@@ ts and pri@@ ces .
it can only be understood in the context of story , and everything , all of this is story .
and that &apos;s because it &apos;s such an en@@ ra@@ ging , yet enga@@ ging place to be .
so to give you an idea of what that &apos;s like , i &apos;d like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectac@@ le , and show you what an amazing journey it &apos;s taken me on .
we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our dis@@ agre@@ ements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
and heli@@ os now begins the process of turning her back to the sun , to maxim@@ ize the power from her solar ar@@ ray .
how did you end up in ja@@ il ? this was just a few weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
there &apos;s a hole here , and i shu@@ t this .
my name &apos;s jam@@ ie oliver . i &apos;m 34 years old .
so that was the second project .
i also like it because it &apos;s an in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally kind of mor@@ ally re@@ de@@ em@@ ing exercise .
she grab@@ s another one . she does this over and over .
it &apos;s simply acceler@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a clin@@ ically relevant ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale .
here &apos;s what happened to this company .
at the top , you &apos;ll notice a section of source code .
so i combined these two ideas and i formul@@ ated a hypo@@ thesis , saying that , could possibly the car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens be de@@ cre@@ ased due to a mar@@ in@@ ade and could it be due to the differences in p@@ h ?
the stories we tell about each other matter very much .
i met her last oc@@ tober in india , and she grew up in a conserva@@ tive environment .
i remember that scene like it was yesterday ; i was 16 , i was in tears , i was in the clos@@ et , and i &apos;m looking at these two people , fer@@ ris bu@@ eller and some guy i &apos;d never seen before , fighting for love .
david mc@@ cand@@ less turns complex data sets into beautiful , simple diagra@@ ms that te@@ ase out un@@ seen patterns and connections . good design , he sugge@@ sts , is the best way to navi@@ gate information gl@@ u@@ t -- and it may just change the way we see the world .
and i said , &quot; but you &apos;ve got two cars ... &quot; -- i &apos;m nine years old .
the last stage is basically waste , and this is is pretty much where everybody dis@@ regar@@ ds it .
all that &apos;s separ@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
thank you very much .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re interested in looking at in my lab .
when you look at the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , they &apos;re highly bran@@ ched .
i want you to point directly at his fore@@ head , ok .
of course you &apos;re going to think this .
so , this woman , who conver@@ ted from the church of england to ca@@ tho@@ lic@@ ism when she married my father -- and there &apos;s no one more r@@ ab@@ id than a ca@@ tho@@ lic conver@@ t -- decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria , particularly among ig@@ b@@ o women , the bil@@ l@@ ings ov@@ ulation me@@ th@@ od , which was the only appro@@ ved birth control by the ca@@ tho@@ lic church .
and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 9@@ 0s to study really complex processes .
j@@ l : one more .
yesterday , ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te was talking about viral tele@@ communications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating is this is not a sing@@ ular event ; this happens across the developing world .
i &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religions , on world religions , for all of our children in pri@@ mary school , in high school , in public schools , in priv@@ ate schools and in home scho@@ ol@@ ing .
first , she talked about comfort , status , beauty .
there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspi@@ ration to live in a real house or to be associated with a far@@ away place , like that hotel in swe@@ den .
depen@@ ding on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attra@@ ct the attention of a potential single ti@@ cket bu@@ yer , now comp@@ et@@ es with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citi@@ zen sees every single day .
i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating app@@ lications for mobile phones and we start creating app@@ lications for our own body .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing single source of carbon in canada , and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person .
so , how do we t@@ ack@@ le the last mile ?
that &apos;s one of those new cho@@ col@@ ate cell phones . &quot;
dan ari@@ ely : are we in control of our own decisions ?
but it really hasn &apos;t been studied very much .
b@@ p obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
neuroscience is hop@@ eless . &quot;
and we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did 10 years ago . we need a pump@@ -@@ push from the fe@@ der@@ al government , through ni@@ h and national science -- n@@ s@@ f -- and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psycho@@ active drugs .
inspi@@ re us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we &apos;ve created at santa barbara .
al@@ ong@@ side that is &quot; don &apos;t think twi@@ ce , it &apos;s all right . &quot;
to put it into perspective , if you compare this to the soldiers in iraq , for instance , right now fighting the war : 0@@ .@@ 5 percent .
when people hear alex speaking my words , do they experience a dis@@ connect ?
another one is that i met a min@@ er . he was home on his three-@@ month leave from the min@@ es .
and of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
ur : i &apos;d never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that &apos;s why i had so much more fun learning it .
here &apos;s a pas@@ sage -- it &apos;s very much what he said , anyway .
i didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
whereas in india , you cannot do that , because you have to listen to the public .
now , our big symbol at ide@@ o is actually not so much the place , it &apos;s a thing .
i think it &apos;s the most vi@@ able vehicle right now to pass information across a dedi@@ cated c@@ able .
he used a to@@ aster o@@ ven , and he even made his own vor@@ tex mix@@ er , based on a tu@@ t@@ ori@@ al by another scientist / ma@@ ker .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ce@@ os , c@@ mo@@ s .
and part of the reason why we don &apos;t know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here .
it was awful .
one was hot , one was cold .
if i would split china , look here , shanghai has already cat@@ ched up .
pay 20@@ ,000 pounds to en@@ dow a hospital ward and you &apos;re called a philanthrop@@ ist .
now , i look at it some@@ what as a way -- when you learn ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing what you learn is how to feel with your eyes , and see with your hands because you &apos;re not looking at your hands , you &apos;re looking at where the balls are or you &apos;re looking at the audience .
this was a huge success for them because the ima@@ gery got shown in the press the day after in every single newsp@@ aper , broad@@ she@@ ets and tab@@ lo@@ i@@ ds .
so you don &apos;t k@@ ick . but you do use a small fli@@ ck .
the difference between a strug@@ gl@@ ing family and a healthy one is often the presence of an em@@ powered woman or women at the center of that family .
you set a couple of boun@@ dar@@ y conditions , like gravi@@ ty , the surface ten@@ sion , density , etc . , and then you press &quot; ex@@ ec@@ ute , &quot; and magi@@ cally , the universe produ@@ ces you a perfect ball l@@ ens .
so by all means , go ahead and do that , that &apos;s good .
by the time we get there , every place with a r@@ ough se@@ mb@@ lan@@ ce of govern@@ ance might actually be on their way .
there is , however , ample evidence to show that in@@ car@@ cer@@ ating people increases their risk of hiv and other infe@@ ctions .
and so that &apos;s how this all oper@@ ates .
this is my big vision .
in this case , at these is@@ lands , you know , cor@@ als are instru@@ ment@@ al-@@ quality recor@@ ders of change in the water .
so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to simul@@ ate -- not chris speci@@ fi@@ cally , i should say , but humans in general .
i can &apos;t tell you what a privi@@ lege it is to introdu@@ ce cur@@ tis w@@ ong from microsoft .
so can we explain those 20 numbers ?
so , how do you do im@@ itation ? why is im@@ itation important ?
and you were walking along and you were hand@@ ing the l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop@@ s out to people in line and talking about sh@@ in@@ er@@ ama .
scientist : i want to show you something .
robert full : it &apos;ll go on different sur@@ fac@@ es -- here &apos;s sand -- although we haven &apos;t perfe@@ cted the feet yet , but i &apos;ll talk about that later .
i &apos;m extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be the biggest stunt on earth .
and here we see a picture on top of a h@@ ill in central valley last de@@ c@@ em@@ ber .
all four of my grand@@ parents , for example , left school in their early ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence . they had no choice .
some of you have heard the story before , but , in fact , there &apos;s somebody in the audience who &apos;s never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before , so i &apos;m a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story .
and at the end of it , we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done , and i said , &quot; it is so beautiful . &quot;
the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives .
and in europe , there &apos;s certain parts of europe , where we &apos;re seeing a four@@ -@@ fold increase in certain gen@@ ital birth de@@ fe@@ cts .
then we also look at the idea of co@@ w-@@ po@@ ol@@ ing , which is the whole phenomenon of con@@ sumers organi@@ zing together to buy meat from organic far@@ ms that they know is safe and controll@@ ed in the way that they want it to be controll@@ ed .
i &apos;m going to lo@@ g in .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; vi@@ cious &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
and finally , an acr@@ ony@@ m .
first , we cut away the ner@@ ve to his own muscle , then we took the arm ner@@ ves and just kind of had them shift down onto his ch@@ est and closed him up .
and so i could play with the medium , and why i move from one medium to another is to be able to do this .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful eu@@ gene . you could make maps of toronto . &quot;
ghana taught me to look at people differ@@ ently and to look at myself differ@@ ently .
this is a social wor@@ ker intervie@@ wing hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok .
you walk in the door . so the first thing you &apos;ve got to do -- the overall , you know , ar@@ c of your pres@@ entation -- it &apos;s got to start like a rocket .
charles li@@ mb : now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple inf@@ used learning , there is a limit@@ ation to what a child who &apos;s dea@@ f , an inf@@ ant who was born dea@@ f , has in this world in terms of social , edu@@ ca@@ tional , vo@@ ca@@ tional opportunities .
this vast domain of hidden bio@@ diversity is increas@@ ed still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria , which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6@@ ,000 species of bacteria worldwide .
and there , in the town , he &apos;s approach@@ ed by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible do@@ gs you can see in some poor countries , even in america , i think , in some areas -- and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
so for example , right now , if i focus too much on the balls , then there &apos;s no way that i can rela@@ x and talk to you at the same time .
and ri@@ ck and i were on our way to a party in the bronx , and somebody said bron@@ x@@ istan , and somebody said fer@@ r@@ eri@@ st@@ an , and we came up with this new yorker cover , which we were able to -- we didn &apos;t know what we were doing .
looking at dinosau@@ r evolution and studying it , dig@@ ging it up for many years , i end up looking at the mam@@ mal radiation , and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology , advan@@ cing by an order of ma@@ gni@@ tude .
that &apos;s a mistake that could literally cost us our future .
so first of all , the first stage that we &apos;ve seen of the internet was that it was going to link computers .
of course , my job is all about listening , and my a@@ im , really , is to teach the world to listen .
i know ph@@ .@@ d.@@ s in computer science -- this process has brought them to tears , absolute tears .
and we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy of the original design within an ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ical , accep@@ table form@@ at .
as you can see there &apos;s only yellow ter@@ rain .
i was making my way , let &apos;s say , slowly to oxford , and i went through a news ag@@ ent , and i saw a magazine , a men &apos;s magazine , and it said on the front , &quot; how to bring your partner to org@@ as@@ m in 30 seconds . &quot;
what about global politics ?
so i was just like , well there &apos;s all kinds of co@@ at han@@ gers .
i li@@ ked this one the best : a level 60 war@@ lo@@ ck with lots of ep@@ ics for 17@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars .
for example , some here will remember this day , jun@@ e 19@@ 58 , the national civil defen@@ se dri@@ ll , where tens of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground .
and to realize that this is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ berg that when you compare everything here to south africa , it just p@@ ales , because in south africa , each year 3@@ 00,000 mothers with hiv give birth to children .
that we could take people who had the fear that they weren &apos;t creative , and we could take them through a series of steps , kind of like a series of small success@@ es , and they turn fear into famili@@ ar@@ ity , and they surprise themselves .
the president dis@@ missed the secre@@ tary of state , whom he was con@@ fer@@ ring with , and asked the den@@ ti@@ st if he would re@@ move a to@@ oth .
ka@@ vi@@ ta ra@@ m@@ das : radi@@ cal women , embra@@ cing tradition
tri@@ -@@ fold . fold ...
well , in business , that &apos;s certainly not the way we would go about it .
we &apos;re born to make a difference .
who@@ a .
and that &apos;s when it happened .
because to find a place like this today on earth is really very , very challenging .
and so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , i made him &quot; the uncle phone . &quot;
the second of the four values is this movement toward eth@@ ics and fair play .
so throughout this talk i &apos;ve mentioned a few times the special case of u@@ ganda , and the fact that it &apos;s the only country in sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa with successful pre@@ vention .
sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , l@@ ing@@ ala .
in fa@@ iling states , geno@@ ci@@ d@@ al states , under@@ -@@ go@@ ver@@ ned states , precisely the kinds of places that thre@@ ats to this country exist on the hori@@ z@@ on , and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world &apos;s suffering tends to get concent@@ rated .
so if i now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a magnetic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance .
but we really have to edu@@ cate .
on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
all this ima@@ gery was creating a lot of f@@ uss and i was c@@ ited as a dis@@ gu@@ sting artist . the press were writing about this , giving full pa@@ ges about how terrible this was .
can you con@@ fir@@ m , chris ?
and we use na@@ i@@ ve experts who may know nothing about the countries we &apos;re de@@ aling with , but may know something about something else to try to in@@ je@@ ct new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our cli@@ ents .
and the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward , like one rais@@ in for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her be@@ for@@ eh@@ and .
so , it was an acci@@ dent@@ al dis@@ covery .
or the g@@ all@@ up pol@@ l that showed that seven in 10 americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
if you go back to im@@ peri@@ al ro@@ me in the year 1 a.@@ d. , there was ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly about 1,@@ 8@@ 00 years where there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of growth .
nm : well , um ...
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa to find these rob@@ ust self-@@ organi@@ zing algorith@@ ms .
and for hundreds , even thousands of years , the home was really the center of life .
pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y business .
but to the second question , half of them that didn &apos;t like it , they wanted it to continue .
that water will go then to the farmers , and the farmers will be able to water their plants , and they will be able then to supply society with food .
so , why -- why and where -- did cho@@ p su@@ ey come from ?
what you &apos;re looking at is an incredible pi@@ p@@ e organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean .
basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
but i don &apos;t really believe in architec@@ tural problems ; i only believe in opportunities .
here , you &apos;ve got mar@@ ti@@ an alphab@@ et .
we &apos;re done with that .
it &apos;s a really important problem .
70 percent redu@@ ction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn &apos;t do .
now , the most optimi@@ stic dreams can get d@@ ented by the pros@@ pe@@ ct of people pl@@ under@@ ing the planet .
to be a les@@ bi@@ an , a dy@@ ke , a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual in most parts of the world , including right here in our country , india , is to occup@@ y a place of immen@@ se dis@@ comfort and extreme pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce .
robert neu@@ wir@@ th , author of &quot; sha@@ dow cities , &quot; fin@@ ds the world &apos;s squ@@ at@@ ter sites -- where a billion people now make their hom@@ es -- to be thri@@ ving centers of in@@ genu@@ ity and innovation . he takes us on a tour .
we hold ourselves back .
and i look at the logo -- okay , good .
so he figured out . &quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; okay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ em@@ ony . &quot;
we found that it did .
enga@@ ge a company having pri@@ or success@@ es for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimi@@ ze the design of the first port@@ able t@@ ms device and that is the second wish .
we have no high-@@ fru@@ ct@@ ose cor@@ n sy@@ ru@@ p , no tr@@ ans f@@ ats , no process@@ ed fo@@ ods .
it &apos;s because gandhi believed in villages and because the british rul@@ ed from the cities , therefore ne@@ hr@@ u thought of new delhi as an un@@ -@@ indian city .
and so there was the paper , and he pro@@ posed a three-@@ str@@ anded structure .
can anyone see what it is ?
and this effect han@@ ged on . so 2007 fig@@ ures looked like this .
then , after j@@ es@@ us died on the cross for our sins , on his way up to heaven he stopped by america and vis@@ ited the ne@@ ph@@ it@@ es .
he once said that he laugh@@ ed so he did not cr@@ y , that a good story , for him , was better than a drop of wh@@ is@@ key .
while i was ab@@ sent from iran , the islam@@ ic revolution had des@@ cen@@ ded on iran and had entirely transformed the country from per@@ si@@ an to the islam@@ ic culture .
there &apos;s a very short list of these places .
so i would sit there with a la@@ wn chair and just carry up all the people who didn &apos;t have cad@@ dies .
and the answer , obviously , is not .
those first two are portra@@ its of mega@@ -@@ j@@ ack@@ pot winn@@ ers years before and after their win .
no big deal .
now four com is@@ af &apos;s later , we hear a different message : &quot; this cannot be won milit@@ arily .
mi@@ wa ma@@ tre@@ ye@@ k : gl@@ ori@@ ous visions in animation and performance
yeah , i &apos;ve really enjo@@ yed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
so the blo@@ w@@ out in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization .
too many other smart people out there . so .
the second foundation is fair@@ ness / reci@@ pro@@ city .
what &apos;s a moral oper@@ ating system ?
we can choose life over fear .
but i want them to play ; as a mom , i want them to play , like , re@@ al-@@ world play .
and it didn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re an extreme opti@@ mist , a mil@@ d opti@@ mist or slightly pessi@@ mi@@ stic , everyone &apos;s left inf@@ eri@@ or frontal gy@@ rus was func@@ tion@@ ing perfectly well , whether you &apos;re bar@@ ack ob@@ ama or woo@@ dy allen .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wo@@ unded war@@ ri@@ ors in the u.s. ar@@ med services .
and like the one you just saw , it can produce these as b@@ ands of light .
the message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us at@@ tain a des@@ ir@@ able balance between technology and nature . the sta@@ kes are high as we speed toward a challenging future .
this is a very impres@@ sive record indeed .
so i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve really ear@@ ned the right to call myself an indian .
eat it , and feel privi@@ le@@ ged .
that &apos;s easier for them to find out than who you are .
thank you very much .
and mean@@ while , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
we discovered blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
now i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don &apos;t have a problem of economics , technology and public policy .
aren &apos;t those negative emotions , or de@@ struc@@ tive emotions , inher@@ ent to the nature of mind ?
we call it a complex system , which it is , but it &apos;s also something else .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate .
this is my wife and collabor@@ ator , rup@@ al .
but here we can get both the an@@ atom@@ ical ima@@ ging and the temperature maps in real time .
so i &apos;ve been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people &apos;s relationship to the future self without using commit@@ ment devices .
sal@@ am@@ anders have this amazing capacity to re@@ generate .
i left the ka@@ ab@@ a to eat something in down@@ town me@@ c@@ ca .
yves , thank you very much . yves ros@@ sy .
the information you need to do this is not secret .
and you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but congress seems not to have let that bo@@ ther them too much .
at the same time in south africa , after nel@@ son mand@@ ela had been rele@@ ased from prison , the black population com@@ men@@ ced the final phase of liber@@ ation from ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d .
mu@@ ji@@ ba , from mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a : her main power is she &apos;s able to answer any question .
this is a scene at base camp , at one of the camp@@ s where some of the cli@@ mbers were lost .
they can have one marsh@@ mal@@ low now . but if they wait until the experim@@ enter comes back , they can have two .
it &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
and we wat@@ ched them and i &apos;m so than@@ k@@ ful , because she &apos;s just like , &quot; wow ! this is so amazing . &quot;
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
the pop@@ -@@ t@@ art , the pr@@ ing@@ le , che@@ e@@ z whi@@ z , none of that stuff .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by su@@ zu@@ k@@ i .
the master of shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts -- it &apos;s , of course , nature .
now , much has been said and written about the ar@@ av@@ ind eye institute in ma@@ dur@@ ai , india .
it &apos;s roughly 250 yards across , so it &apos;s pretty big -- big size , you know , bigger than a foot@@ ball stadium -- and it &apos;s going to pass by the earth in ap@@ ri@@ l of 20@@ 2@@ 9 .
these mos@@ ses are taken from the forest ; they &apos;re used by the fl@@ or@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture industry , by fl@@ or@@ ists , to make ar@@ ran@@ gem@@ ents and make hanging bas@@ k@@ ets .
our kids love this process .
i &apos;ve been in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this question of whether we could evol@@ ve or develop a si@@ x@@ th sense -- a sense that would give us se@@ am@@ less access and easy access to meta@@ -@@ information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we &apos;re coming across .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , whether it &apos;s to do with mal@@ nutrition .
wild is love .
so i am a movement ch@@ au@@ vin@@ ist .
it &apos;s arro@@ gant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
so now what we do is we take a genome , we make maybe 50 cop@@ ies of it , we cut all those cop@@ ies up into little 50-@@ base rea@@ ds , and then we sequence them , massi@@ v@@ ely parallel .
i &apos;d like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years of research that we did -- actually , some of the voices are more recent .
thank you .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
i &apos;ll explain what that means . we &apos;re looking at three trends .
this is roughly between 100 and 150 million , today .
as ch@@ au@@ cer said , &quot; love is blind . &quot;
what j@@ on@@ as did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places .
and if i would also look at india , you have another type of in@@ equ@@ ity , actually , in india .
he had kids from all over korea living there , and he would find families for these kids .
and our main idea was to sort of s@@ ample the seven most significant mountains of the top@@ o@@ graphy of a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ t them into urban and architec@@ tural structures , in@@ hab@@ it@@ able of human life .
and so i thought , you know what , this is the career for me , because i am interested in some mess@@ y top@@ ics .
once again , a plan@@ t-@@ based di@@ et , full of vege@@ tab@@ les with lots of color in them .
and i &apos;m going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk .
is that -- could you still pause on that one actually , for a minute ?
m@@ o : my bo@@ y@@ sc@@ out tro@@ op would like to re@@ build 12 ma@@ il@@ boxes .
then there is a coffee table . i also did a coffee table .
now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
but what we find is that they pre@@ fer the pro-@@ social to@@ ken .
an@@ il gu@@ p@@ ta : india &apos;s hidden hot@@ be@@ ds of invention
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of cos@@ me@@ tic standards .
now , mu@@ mit@@ a was a fun one to name . mu@@ mit@@ a is the destro@@ yer .
we started from social media data , we combined it stati@@ st@@ ically with data from u.s. government social security , and we ended up predi@@ cting social security numbers , which in the united states are extremely sensitive information .
when i lost my 40 pounds a few years ago , i did it simply by restri@@ cting those things , which ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly sugge@@ sts i have a bi@@ as based on my personal experience .
bi@@ cycl@@ es have become for@@ bi@@ dden many places .
we follow those who lead , not for them , but for ourselves .
we knew conservation would fa@@ il if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
these bacteria were not un@@ covered sooner because they are also among the small@@ est of all earth &apos;s organis@@ ms -- so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional op@@ tical micros@@ copy .
the third year , the total was up to around 40 .
there are 200 countries in the world . we like to think of the internet as a global village .
and i had to say , every night when i said my pra@@ yers .
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
and we &apos;ve also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of man@@ kind through dna genetic pro@@ fil@@ ing .
and m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ als , certainly , these eng@@ ines of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship , 6@@ 4 percent of whom decide first where they want to live , then they move there , then they look for a job , they will come to your city .
another one , a guy called -- this is absolutely true ! -- his computer had crash@@ ed , and he told the techni@@ cian he couldn &apos;t re@@ start it no matter how many times he typ@@ ed 11 .
he leaves the wire . he knows that those people have his back .
so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags , i then thought i &apos;d invest 7@@ .@@ 9@@ 5 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in kil@@ rush for a mo@@ p handle and even less money on some o@@ ven cle@@ an@@ ers .
in a way , just like tol@@ sto@@ y &apos;s stat@@ ement about every un@@ happy mar@@ ri@@ age being different , every collap@@ sed or en@@ danger@@ ed society is different -- they all have different details . but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , there are certain common thre@@ ads that emer@@ ge from these compar@@ is@@ ons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threat@@ ened societies today . one interesting common thre@@ ad has to do with , in many cases , the rapi@@ di@@ ty of collapse after a society reach@@ es its pe@@ ak . there are many societies that don &apos;t wind down gradu@@ ally , but they build up -- get ri@@ cher and more powerful -- and then within a short time , within a few decades after their pe@@ ak , they collapse . for example , the clas@@ sic low@@ land may@@ a of the y@@ u@@ cat@@ an began to collapse in the early 8@@ 0@@ 0s -- literally a few decades after the may@@ a were building their biggest mon@@ um@@ ents , and may@@ a population was greatest .
and so we started thinking , well , wouldn &apos;t it be ne@@ at to build some technology that would allow the dol@@ ph@@ ins to requ@@ est these things in real time , their favorite to@@ ys ?
we were not going to leave until the peace accor@@ d was sig@@ ned . &quot;
a high degree of inter@@ conne@@ ctivity can be bad for st@@ ability , because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic .
most of you may not know that f@@ ung@@ i were the first organis@@ ms to come to land .
and i just love to see the world . the world is an amazing place .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmos@@ pher@@ ic life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they &apos;re levi@@ tated .
she wasn &apos;t miser@@ able at all .
in fact , when you go back to the beginning , there were no priv@@ ate inv@@ e@@ stors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day , that were known to be some of the most ris@@ k-@@ aver@@ se people on the planet and that were working in one of the ris@@ ki@@ est se@@ ctors , agriculture .
trials are very old . the first tri@@ al was in the bi@@ ble -- daniel 1 : 12 .
but i &apos;m happy to say now that the world has moved on , music has moved on with it .
there &apos;s a youtube video that you can down@@ load and look at this , if you want to con@@ vey the information to other people about virtual au@@ top@@ si@@ es .
so the way i per@@ cei@@ ve a mistake when i &apos;m on the band@@ stand -- first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
and these were the con@@ dom@@ s that we introduced .
so you really can bring into a village , and then the villages can connect themselves , and you really can do it quite well .
if i were here playing c@@ ello , or playing on a syn@@ th , or sharing my music with you , i &apos;d be able to show things about myself that i can &apos;t tell you in words , more personal things , perhaps deep@@ er things .
and he says to me &quot; will@@ ard , can you put my house on a pin@@ head ? &quot;
so you can -- in fact , it &apos;s tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse . so , we go ahead , and we start scri@@ b@@ bling , and -- so the idea is that you can really , you know , par@@ take in this process , but watch something really cr@@ app@@ y look beautiful .
it takes an entire civilization to build a to@@ aster . designer thomas th@@ wa@@ it@@ es found out the hard way , by attemp@@ ting to build one from scratch : min@@ ing ore for steel , deri@@ ving plastic from oil ... it &apos;s fran@@ k@@ ly amazing he got as far as he got . a par@@ able of our inter@@ connected society , for designers and con@@ sumers ali@@ ke .
this is more or less what we saw last year , and this is how it will go on into the future .
and we don &apos;t even need to con@@ fine ourselves to this ma@@ cr@@ o vision .
it depends on how old they are , and which country , whether they &apos;re in a city or rural , as to what kinds of projects .
che@@ f : do you ?
some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way . i &apos;m using my brain theory to see .
i had closed all the cur@@ tains in the ap@@ art@@ ment , so in the middle of the day the ap@@ art@@ ment was in near total dar@@ k@@ ness .
and that process takes about two hours .
this is my little di@@ version into my real passion , which is genetics .
and also , recently , very funny debate between the beijing environment min@@ i@@ stry and the american em@@ bas@@ sy in beijing because the min@@ i@@ stry bl@@ amed the american em@@ bas@@ sy for inter@@ ven@@ ing in chinese inter@@ n@@ al politics by dis@@ clos@@ ing the air quality data of beijing .
and one more thing : no , don &apos;t f it up . &quot;
tell a little bit about what you &apos;re wearing on your leg .
are we the only ones that see illu@@ sions ?
al@@ an ka@@ y : a powerful ideas about ideas
so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game .
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the p@@ ace we &apos;re going at right now .
and you do not need to be a highly trained , speci@@ alized an@@ es@@ thes@@ i@@ olog@@ ist to use this machine , which is good because , in these rural distri@@ ct hospitals , you &apos;re not going to get that level of training .
so the final project i want to talk about is the sa@@ har@@ a forest project , which we &apos;re working on at the moment .
so it br@@ ings me to my main ta@@ ke-@@ home message , which is we can aver@@ t a tragedy of the common@@ s .
i ref@@ use to ac@@ knowledge this as anything like an acci@@ dent .
flying mon@@ ks .
and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father , was just going out the window .
you don@@ ate money to a cause , and you become emotion@@ ally involved in that cause .
that girl can take her i@@ phone , put it on the robot , send an e@@ mail to grand@@ ma , who lives on the other side of the country .
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states .
for chr@@ is@@ sy and i , one of the things that &apos;s important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of em@@ bo@@ died knowledge .
but i had a lot of fun .
they know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do to you ?
it comes back at times of great transfor@@ mation , glob@@ alization being one of those transforma@@ tions .
this is one of the largest under@@ ground lab@@ s in the world .
there were only two other dan@@ n@@ ys on the internet then .
well , it &apos;s certainly not this one .
pri@@ mates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all .
today , we &apos;ve seen a 6@@ 3-@@ percent redu@@ ction in mortality from heart disease -- remark@@ ably , 1.@@ 1 million deaths aver@@ ted every year .
i &apos;m going to give you some example .
how else can we create new ideas ?
if the water table goes down , you will find new sta@@ irs .
if i know what your competition does , how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your l@@ unch over here ?
but it is increasingly possible .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
all right , now what you might notice is that these two graph@@ s are actually iden@@ tical , not in terms of the x@@ - and y-@@ ax@@ es , or in terms of the data they present , but in terms of their moral and political imp@@ lications , they say the same thing .
most of us from the ship -- even i -- look out at the ocean and see this hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous sea .
ari@@ el : i bo@@ ar@@ ded the king &apos;s ship . in every c@@ ab@@ in , i fl@@ amed amaz@@ ement .
the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel .
the innovation in this project is to cast mu@@ d like you cast con@@ cre@@ te .
and it is within that culture that we really can get -- and this is the no@@ vel@@ ty -- something that is not entirely set by our biology .
that &apos;s where we should move .
he took a piece of paper , dre@@ w a and b on one side and the other and fol@@ ded them together so where a and b touched .
and from this information , we can begin to map the hope spots .
he had a wonderful r@@ app@@ ort .
and that &apos;s the process we took -- let me show you how the engine works .
thanks . that has a certain kind of balance to it , which is all about pl@@ um@@ b .
and every time we pa@@ ged them we &apos;d ask them to answer several questions -- on a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ?
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents .
because , you know what , many of us are sort of at the end of our care@@ ers , and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids , the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .
the cam@@ el sm@@ ells were unbelie@@ vable .
they are more controll@@ ed .
freedom means i may not be identi@@ fied as any one group , but that i can visit and find myself in every group .
sb : par@@ don ?
okay ? ready ?
what if you &apos;re only going to be anony@@ mous for 15 minutes ?
i got a lot wrong .
now in the mean@@ time , the audience , they go crazy .
and that , i think , is a great case study , a great lesson in the power , the mar@@ vel@@ ous , kind of un@@ plan@@ ned emer@@ gent , un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able power of open innovative systems .
people who hadn &apos;t dr@@ unk from the pu@@ mp were not getting sick .
because that event was the scientific revolution , ever since which our knowledge of the physical world , and of how to adap@@ t it to our wi@@ shes , has been growing rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ly .
there &apos;s often too many people in the me@@ et@@ ings , and they &apos;re very , very expensive to the organization .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j@@ .@@ d. ho@@ o@@ ker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
lo@@ ose change , small change is a real problem , and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff , you &apos;re due , say , 10 cents , 20 cents in change .
i couldn &apos;t leave the story , and i couldn &apos;t leave the topic either , because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about , or even wish to .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differ@@ ently , the problem has been solved .
but we found that when we de@@ vi@@ ated from the specific set@@ ness of the mathema@@ tical code that under@@ lies it -- the simple algorith@@ m cro@@ ch@@ et three , increase one -- when we de@@ vi@@ ated from that and made em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
now today , i told you about very strange and weird proto@@ cells -- some that con@@ tain c@@ lay , some that have pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al o@@ o@@ ze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them .
i &apos;m going to give you one of these two te@@ as , and keep in mind , i &apos;m going to pick one of these two te@@ as at random for you .
well , there won &apos;t be any fish except for min@@ no@@ ws , and the water will be pretty dir@@ ty , and all those kinds of things and full of mer@@ cur@@ y , etc . , etc .
living am@@ ong@@ st our tun@@ as -- our north american tun@@ as -- are european tun@@ as that go back to the med .
well , there is a trick@@ iness that you have to make it 150 million degrees , but there is a trick@@ iness about the re@@ action yet .
if you take the 10 countries that went on to become the western emp@@ ires , in 1@@ 500 they were really quite tiny -- five percent of the world &apos;s land surface , 16 percent of its population , maybe 20 percent of its income .
and you know why i understand that ?
risd al@@ ums ? yeah , risd . there we go , risd . wo@@ o , risd .
a pion@@ e@@ er in research on play , dr. stu@@ art brown says humor , games , rough@@ hous@@ ing , fli@@ r@@ tation and fan@@ tas@@ y are more than just fun . pl@@ ent@@ y of play in childhood makes for happy , smart adults -- and keeping it up can make us smarter at any age .
but moving into work -- and we have each week what &apos;s called a journal club , when you &apos;d sit down with the other doctors and you &apos;d study a scientific paper in rel@@ ation to medicine .
and then this older sister stood up and said , &quot; i too am living with the virus , and i &apos;ve been ash@@ amed . &quot;
one guy wrote another guy . he said , &quot; i never knew these people laugh@@ ed . &quot;
have a look .
i launched a big program &#91; unclear &#93; c@@ sir about nine years ago .
but there &apos;s this other aspect of it for whe@@ eli@@ es , so check this out . there &apos;s a few tricks , again , how environment changes the nature of your tricks .
so the star@@ rs , in adap@@ ting this to their home , created a morning che@@ ck@@ list in which each child is expected to ti@@ ck off ch@@ or@@ es .
they put them about one in@@ ch above the ground , and then they shu@@ t everything off and they go p@@ fft .
you should get points for doing this on time .
we thought , ah , this is when it &apos;s going to happen .
mean@@ while , instead of sending someone working dra@@ w@@ ings , which are those huge sets of blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts that you &apos;ve seen your whole life , what the architect can do is send a set of assem@@ bly in@@ struc@@ tions , like you used to get when you were a child , when you bought little models that said , &quot; bol@@ t a to b , and c to d. &quot;
thank you .
but everything else is just lying there .
you can &apos;t compare the effect of multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ t@@ asking and the effect of playing action games . they have totally different effects on different aspects of cogni@@ tion , perception and attention .
and it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
the question i leave you with now is which is the ball@@ ast you would like to throw over@@ board ?
and he &apos;s a bad guy . he &apos;s like a bad kid in church .
i started cr@@ ying .
i &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re non@@ re@@ cti@@ lin@@ e@@ ar c@@ actu@@ s building blocks , so it &apos;s totally leg@@ it . &quot;
&#91; s@@ ans@@ kr@@ it &#93; this is an o@@ de to the mother go@@ dd@@ ess , that most of us in india learn when we are children .
they really tell us what &apos;s going on there .
we want the best drugs , the best technologies , the best speci@@ ali@@ sts , but we don &apos;t think too much about how it all comes together .
they actually call it the os@@ car cur@@ se .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works .
most of the time it &apos;s a flexi@@ ble organ .
it did have a ra@@ m pack .
and we &apos;ve all seen &quot; 200@@ 1 : a space o@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y . &quot;
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal li@@ ability if you do not ur@@ ge your ce@@ o to get the maximum income from redu@@ cing and tra@@ ding the carbon emissions that can be avo@@ i@@ ded . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomp@@ li@@ sh this .
the can@@ n@@ eri@@ es are gone . the poll@@ ution has ab@@ ated .
every year in the united states alone , 2,@@ 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ ,000 cou@@ ples make a legal and spi@@ ritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and so light sh@@ one upon the dark ages of europe .
it &apos;s been called an alexander gra@@ ham bell patent .
the chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
lg : here -- you see some are missing ?
we &apos;ve said , could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions , and so you switch to the positive emotions ?
i said , &quot; oh -- now , i don &apos;t have a u@@ ter@@ us because i had cancer a few years ago . so , does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old u@@ ter@@ us back ? &quot; and they said , &quot; sure . &quot;
but it &apos;s going to moder@@ ni@@ ze weap@@ ons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime , unless we get up off our ...
i mean , this was -- was i my things ?
we also see the trend toward tour@@ ism that &apos;s a little bit more low key . right ?
spi@@ ders are also extremely old .
d@@ d : this is something i call &quot; sw@@ inging in the rain . &quot;
okay .
they &apos;re doing their best .
those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liber@@ ty , and liber@@ ty for whom .
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
every night i fall as@@ le@@ ep very well , and i am , i repe@@ at , the happ@@ i@@ est man in the world , and i &apos;m than@@ k@@ ful i am alive .
my sons , they love the screen . they love the screen .
the yo@@ un@@ gest son took his nin@@ th -- a nin@@ th of 18 is two .
this tends to be very different from what people expect .
so last ju@@ ly ... i moved from america in jun@@ e , ran in ju@@ ly ele@@ ction and won .
and that &apos;s actually the good news .
now , if you take a game like war@@ cra@@ ft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
and the vast bul@@ k of massive pri@@ mes we &apos;ve ever found are of that form : two to a prime number , take away one .
and those fis@@ h@@ es that you see right now are new species .
people would look at these and say , &quot; man , this thing is so big and so hard to s@@ wal@@ low . if this doesn &apos;t make me feel better , you know , what possibly could ? &quot;
watson was in fact listening to very low-@@ frequency radio emissions caused by nature .
the second is that problems are solu@@ ble .
we have more than 100 trans@@ lat@@ ors cover@@ ing 6@@ 3 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital .
thank you .
and to be an architect , somehow you have to negoti@@ ate between left and right , and you have to negoti@@ ate between this very priv@@ ate place where ideas take place and the outside world , and then make it understood .
most people died around the age of 50 .
there is no car@@ et@@ aking in desire .
if you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your b@@ oss &apos; plate , for example , that would be an aw@@ k@@ ward situation .
and i &apos;m not going to give you the pat@@ o@@ is trans@@ lation ; i &apos;m going to make it standard english .
my son is 2@@ 3 .
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks , but the fact that it perfor@@ ms a very important social function .
and if you want to get more specific , how about a 57@@ 7@@ r gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ?
in 2004 , i had a little baby boy , and i call him my mi@@ ra@@ cle child , because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and dar@@ k@@ ness in my life , this ray of hope was born .
it &apos;s not that they usually sue , it &apos;s not that they would win , but it &apos;s an indi@@ cation of the cor@@ ros@@ ion of authority .
i said , &quot; you get into bi@@ op@@ oly@@ mers . &quot; they looked straight through me .
they &apos;re dead ends . they are ro@@ und@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts or traffic j@@ ams or gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck in conversation .
mar@@ ri@@ a@@ ge-@@ man@@ ual author and se@@ men@@ -@@ s@@ ni@@ ffer the@@ o@@ door van de vel@@ de -- has a line in his book .
peter ty@@ ack of woo@@ ds hole talks about a hidden wonder of the sea : underwater sound . on@@ stage at mission blue , he expla@@ ins the amazing ways whales use sound and song to communicate across hundreds of miles of ocean .
and what seems to have happened here is that the indu@@ s tra@@ ders , the mer@@ chan@@ ts , were using this script to write a foreign language .
d@@ j : okay , so she was a little bit r@@ ough .
so we can let computers do all the complicated cryp@@ to@@ graphy for us , and then we &apos;ll use the paper for ver@@ i@@ fication .
we looked at this and we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way . &quot;
you must go back to fight , to bat@@ tle .
it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an un@@ stable situation .
it &apos;s okay to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it &apos;s a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your final goal .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conserva@@ tives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
this morning , you &apos;re sad@@ der , you want to hear your song , the same song , played sad@@ der than you did yesterday .
it gets closer and closer -- 4@@ 0,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave pain@@ t@@ ings .
&quot; well , just for the fun of it . sorry for having fun without you , &quot; is what you should say . &quot; i &apos;ll just go ahead and do it anyway . &quot;
we use some pretty cool techni@@ qu@@ es to do this .
so it was taken for granted that i att@@ end some of the best universi@@ ties , which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity .
i love bar@@ to@@ k &apos;s music , as did mr. tesz@@ ler , and he had virtually every recor@@ ding of bar@@ to@@ k &apos;s music ever issu@@ ed .
so essentially , the mobile phone gives us a connected multi@@ media plat@@ form .
and we were happy with ourselves .
this picture is a typical seas@@ onal gr@@ ass@@ land .
so ...
k &apos;@@ na@@ an : oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh give you freedom , give you fire give you reason , take you higher see the ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons take the field now you define us , make us feel proud in the streets our heads are lif@@ ted as we lose our in@@ hibi@@ tion cele@@ bra@@ tion , it &apos;s around us every nation , all around us mel@@ in@@ da french gates : it fe@@ els pretty good , right ?
threat@@ ening trade wars when these countries talk about wan@@ ting to bring in positive leg@@ is@@ lation to li@@ mit the imp@@ ort of high-@@ carbon fu@@ els , of greenhouse gas emissions , anything like this , at international con@@ ferences , whether they &apos;re in cop@@ enha@@ gen or can@@ cu@@ n , international con@@ ferences on climate change , we &apos;re the country that gets the dinosau@@ r a@@ ward every single day as being the biggest obstac@@ le to progress on this issue .
though many human intellectual and technological le@@ aps had happened in europe and the rest of the world , but africa was sort of cut off .
as i was working through that m@@ our@@ ning process , i was ama@@ zed that i didn &apos;t want to see anybody .
hope brought me to america .
joseph k@@ im : in kor@@ e@@ an ?
i &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
there it is .
now , how are we going to do that when we &apos;re urban@@ i@@ zing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories ?
at this distance , it works immediately .
i was lucky ; i had heard about him for years , and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum in ch@@ eng@@ du .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any pu@@ p@@ pet for us on@@ stage .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
so i jo@@ ined a gy@@ m . &quot;
maybe we should see how they do with los@@ ses .
when fac@@ ed with particularly difficult set@@ bac@@ ks or comple@@ xi@@ ties , a really interesting behavior emer@@ ges : de@@ cor@@ ation .
it &apos;s only within the last 6@@ 0,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world .
so we forget , but we &apos;re also adap@@ table , and we adap@@ t to situ@@ ations around us pretty well .
now , i have one last , two last little stories to tell you , in fin@@ ishing off this business .
and here , you can see one such example , where we lab@@ el the fi@@ bers coming from the brain in red .
the fourth foundation is authority / respect .
so the people kept it .
and everyone &apos;s ta@@ ke-@@ home lesson from that was that the way to get to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive , something to aspi@@ re to . right ?
no ? yes ? doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
the first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our fac@@ es .
it also works for trans@@ mit@@ ting and communic@@ ating data .
and she said , &quot; don &apos;t be so sil@@ ly . &quot;
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
it &apos;s the block@@ bu@@ ster com@@ edy .
thank you so much for your time , and good lu@@ ck with your record .
and i &apos;m going to have michael man@@ ring play b@@ ass with me .
and the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke was repor@@ ted as it was happening .
no , of course you don &apos;t do that ; you put it somewhere in google .
this was just install@@ ed last month .
we say what we do , we say how we &apos;re different or how we &apos;re better and we expect some sort of a behavior , a pur@@ ch@@ ase , a vote , something like that .
and then i put the really t@@ ough question : &quot; how many of you hand@@ -@@ was@@ h your je@@ ans and your bed she@@ ets ? &quot;
and we could har@@ dly even pay anything , any sal@@ aries , in the economy .
the first thing i thought about was my mom , who was cr@@ ying over bes@@ ide me .
there was no food , just little rice .
that &apos;s as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
they felt pretty stupid , so they started sending in their repor@@ ts earlier .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divi@@ de an already small planet into smaller is@@ lands .
so game theory is a bran@@ ch of , origin@@ ally , applied mathematics , used mostly in economics and political science , a little bit in biology , that gives us a mathema@@ tical tax@@ on@@ om@@ y of social life and it predi@@ cts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone &apos;s actions affect everyone else .
so the question is : what are they all doing ?
that &apos;s a very important compon@@ ent of roots and sho@@ ots , with older kids talking to younger ones .
unfortunately , when i got there -- emer@@ ges ray .
kit@@ es : i &apos;m going to give you a brief history , and tell you about the ma@@ gnifi@@ cent future of every child &apos;s favorite play@@ thing .
and far from being a col@@ dly materi@@ ali@@ stic view of nature , it &apos;s a new human@@ ism , it &apos;s a new en@@ chan@@ tment .
i wonder@@ ed what that meant about much of the rest of new haven .
you see , the pun@@ ish@@ ment was working .
we arri@@ ve in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , tra@@ des , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
i &apos;ve got appar@@ ently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction , an ar@@ row ; that in some fundamental sense , it &apos;s good ; that the ar@@ row points to something positive .
that &apos;s an el@@ ev@@ ator that &apos;s constantly moving up and down , but it can be controll@@ ed by the fol@@ ks on land who are responsible for it .
how do we control them ?
you can &apos;t find o@@ iled pengu@@ ins in ar@@ gent@@ ina .
you can make your own purpose .
so they go into a meeting room , they get together , and they talk about stuff that doesn &apos;t really matter usually .
d@@ l : no sur@@ ger@@ ies , oh yeah .
that &apos;s about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations .
we have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s do@@ able , it has great secon@@ dar@@ y benefits , and poli@@ o er@@ adi@@ cation is a great buy .
we have a very ab@@ i@@ ding and he@@ art@@ bre@@ aking part@@ ner@@ ship with our colleagues at the institute for sur@@ gi@@ cal research in the us ar@@ my , who have to treat the now 11@@ ,000 kids that have come back from iraq .
there was someone recently , wasn &apos;t there ? just a couple weeks ago .
but to get us started , i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world .
the spin@@ al cor@@ d had brea@@ ks . the neurons were crossing in every which way .
there &apos;s pretty il@@ legal hu@@ st@@ les : you run a tattoo par@@ l@@ or out of your own cell .
and that really reson@@ ated with me .
i could afford that .
and although that was great for the music business at the time , it wasn &apos;t much good for anything else .
it &apos;s actually bit@@ co@@ in .
this has inspired the design of the first self-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing dry ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve -- the patent issu@@ ed , we &apos;re happy to say .
and the objects which were used as examples , when i was a child and a student , as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -- those objects , i turned them completely around .
yeah . all right .
i pul@@ led them asi@@ de .
the empi@@ re is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produ@@ ces these iden@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
we ho@@ ist@@ ed them on pol@@ es to photograph .
i bought a fast car .
it was called the sin@@ c@@ la@@ ir z@@ x@@ 80 . this was a 1@@ k computer , and you &apos;d buy your programs on cas@@ se@@ tte tape .
your 4@@ 0@@ 1 just got na@@ iled .
and i started putting those two together and wondering , could i build a to@@ y where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life , as it exists and as it might go in the future .
some p@@ und@@ it with too much time on his hands has re@@ ck@@ oned that the new experiments are appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960 , 100 trillion times better .
and i mention this because , if we want to design for that future , we need to figure out what those people are about .
now the students and i enjo@@ yed the class , but it occur@@ red to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology isn &apos;t .
he took women with meta@@ static breast cancer , r@@ and@@ om@@ ly divided them into two groups .
but all this is for us to gl@@ ori@@ fy the name of the cre@@ ator whose pri@@ mary name is the com@@ passion@@ ating , the com@@ passionate .
instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosop@@ her , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
they were mis@@ -@@ sold for more than a hundred years .
but &quot; open , &quot; she says , &quot; open up ! &quot;
and everyone started to think that &quot; this guy could be my brother . &quot;
i &apos;m alive , you may have noticed .
but then i thought , oh , i &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
poli@@ cing doesn &apos;t scale globally . at least , it hasn &apos;t , and our current system of guns , bor@@ der gu@@ ards , big gates and f@@ ences are out@@ d@@ ated in the new world into which we &apos;re moving .
i remember dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair , wr@@ apped in a pla@@ ster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time .
as edu@@ ca@@ tion@@ ists , we have never asked for technology ; we keep bor@@ ro@@ wing it .
and then i suddenly realized that it absolutely didn &apos;t matter where i was going , or where i had come from because we are all essentially perman@@ ently dis@@ placed people .
but you find essentially the same results , nam@@ ely , that after a certain basic point -- which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars above the minim@@ um poverty level -- increases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affect how happy people are .
but this is the face of resili@@ ence .
and , just to kind of te@@ ar down a my@@ th here , lots of people think that when you get infe@@ cted with a computer virus , it &apos;s because you went to a por@@ n site .
pas@@ cal came to believe not only the love and the gra@@ ce of god could bring us back into har@@ mon@@ y , but he believed that his own sins and fail@@ ures could be for@@ given , and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven .
they &apos;re all big .
you , you can teach it .
and there were a lot of cute girls in the sop@@ ran@@ o section , as it turns out .
but it &apos;s only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what &apos;s going on .
and once again , i &apos;d like to look back to pre@@ history to say something about it .
i started taking that into the real@@ m of landscape , which is something that &apos;s almost a picture of nothing .
they wi@@ ped her bin@@ di off her fore@@ head .
that &apos;s how you get ration@@ ality .
i had learned that many people tried to cross the bor@@ der to china in the ni@@ ght@@ time to avo@@ id being seen .
it was , what i would say , com@@ posi@@ tional complexity , and i felt that if i had to ful@@ f@@ ill what i talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a gener@@ ating idea , some kind of a gener@@ ating geom@@ etry .
i edi@@ ted out the last bit when i asked , &quot; where is the neuron ? &quot;
so what this means is that the user can start plu@@ g@@ ging in what they want the bri@@ cks to do .
so , what is simpli@@ city ?
so what did we find after compu@@ ting all this network control ?
absolutely nothing could have prepar@@ ed us for what happened after that .
imagine there &apos;s no heaven and when i get through the end of a thousand of john len@@ n@@ on &apos;s &quot; imagine , &quot; i have sw@@ um nine hours and 45 minutes , exactly .
they were actually attac@@ king them .
so i was thinking that must have come from the shark .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
yes , you can just about see it here .
here they are arri@@ ving at number 10 , and look at this lucky poli@@ ce@@ man gets to shake hands with the president of the united states . oh , and here comes the prime minister of the — ? no .
but really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , i have to ad@@ mit that achiev@@ ing the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
it &apos;s really hard . and so it &apos;s certainly the hard road .
if you ch@@ ase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
and so we end up with va@@ in decisions and we can &apos;t even afford our mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge .
now , i had this brain scan done several years ago , and i used to jo@@ ke around about having a gigan@@ tic internet tr@@ unk line going deep into my visual cortex .
but for me , absolutely the best point is there is no anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation therapy required .
my personal belief is that , rather than having a small , eli@@ te force of highly trained government ag@@ ents here to protect us all , we &apos;re much better off having average and ordinary citizens approach@@ ing this problem as a group and seeing what we can do .
and here i &apos;m expe@@ cting at any moment , &quot; ok , they &apos;re going to turn the page , and i &apos;m going to see the cars , i &apos;m going to see the sket@@ ches , i &apos;m going to see maybe some idea of where it &apos;s going . &quot;
there &apos;s just no place that it doesn &apos;t somehow have a conne@@ ctive tissue to .
i want people to understand that design is so much more than cute cha@@ irs , that it is first and for@@ em@@ ost everything that is around us in our life .
and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common : both of us were dis@@ semin@@ ating the genes of one species and not another , and both of us -- probably , if i can imagine the be@@ e &apos;s point of view -- thought we were calling the sh@@ ots .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is the r@@ hi@@ zo@@ car@@ p@@ on geo@@ graphi@@ c@@ um , or map lichen , and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in green@@ land , which is a long way to go for some lich@@ ens .
our population and our use of the fin@@ ite resources of planet earth are growing exponenti@@ ally , along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill .
he won the no@@ bel prize for liter@@ ature in 194@@ 8 .
it &apos;s a story of inter@@ cultural inter@@ se@@ ctions , and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fas@@ c@@ ism in their respe@@ ctive hi@@ stories and geo@@ graphi@@ es ?
we consu@@ lt to the media about canopy questions ; we have a canopy new@@ sle@@ tter ; we have an e@@ mail li@@ st@@ ser@@ v .
and when they did , they took small@@ po@@ x to 10 other countries and rei@@ gni@@ ted the epidemic .
and we have it in something called an aer@@ os@@ hell .
we can &apos;t rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adver@@ s@@ aries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen , for having respect for dig@@ nity , and for bringing that combination of hu@@ mili@@ ty and a sort of em@@ bol@@ den@@ ed sense of responsibility to our de@@ al@@ ings with the rest of the world .
well , some really nice little tricks .
and we were at this restaurant , and she said , &quot; so , basically , fro@@ gs lay eggs and the eggs turn into ta@@ d@@ pol@@ es , and ta@@ d@@ pol@@ es turn into fro@@ gs . &quot;
he actually understood something about a the@@ me that we &apos;ve been discus@@ sing all week . it &apos;s the role of the audience in an era of per@@ v@@ asive electr@@ on@@ ic communications .
i used them for descri@@ bing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .
so , let &apos;s take control of this ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are : im@@ ple@@ ment a gas ta@@ x immediately ; transition across the nation to ro@@ ad@@ -@@ toll@@ ing with this wir@@ eless mes@@ h ; require that the mes@@ h be open to all , with open standards ; and , of course , use mes@@ h networks .
and i put them together , and you walk between them .
and this institution will have a very cru@@ cial role , not for united states , but for the world .
so , that has always influ@@ enced me .
now , the conventional wisdom was that niger@@ i@@ ans don &apos;t read liter@@ ature .
when we get negative feedback , we still , the next time we &apos;re face with a certain context , tend to make the same err@@ ors .
zero is zero , a little hero of the 21st century , and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could .
but you adop@@ t that combination , and then you start ga@@ ining weight like them .
except for the threat of bio@@ -@@ terrorism , they &apos;re very simple issues in terms of , can we design things to produce clean energy , perhaps revolution@@ i@@ zing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes .
audience : where &apos;s your lab ?
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself thr@@ ust into a for@@ ged docum@@ ents work@@ shop .
i &apos;ve always known that the age of design is upon us , almost like a rap@@ ture .
but even here among us , most -- in the most advanced society in the world , we have poverty .
how else to explain the cultural space occu@@ pi@@ ed by sar@@ ah pal@@ in ?
and the answer , to me , is obvious ; we &apos;re tre@@ ating cancer too late in the game , when it &apos;s already establi@@ shed and , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , it &apos;s already spread or meta@@ st@@ asi@@ zed .
it looks like it did before it started .
so therefore , if i translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
we &apos;ve all seen versi@@ ons of this graph , right , which shows the changes in wealth since 197@@ 9 , and as you can see , almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top 20 percent , and especially the top one percent .
there was only one way to do calcul@@ ating and that was by hand .
it makes no difference if we cut out the brid@@ ges to al@@ as@@ ka in the overall sche@@ me of things .
so you can bu@@ mp things -- they &apos;re all physi@@ cally , you know , mani@@ pul@@ able and stuff .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathema@@ ticians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t repres@@ ent .
so we tried to look at all the different heat eng@@ ines that have been used in history to try and conver@@ t sun@@ light to electricity , or heat to electricity .
spi@@ ders are not just everywhere , but they &apos;re extremely diver@@ se .
these are normal cells .
and they expected that it would be young families , or young men , just like it had always been .
when i went to y@@ ale , we had the first energy crisis , and i was desig@@ ning the first sol@@ ar-@@ he@@ ated house in ireland as a student , which i then built -- which would give you a sense of my ambi@@ tion .
and dan led the team for the syn@@ thesis of this over one-@@ milli@@ on-@@ base pair chromosome .
and that su@@ gar d@@ ough ?
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
the super@@ condu@@ cting la@@ yer , instead of being half a mi@@ cr@@ on thin , being two milli@@ meters thin , quite thin .
video games are not the cause .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
again , coming back to that thing about the li@@ fest@@ yle , and in a way , the ec@@ ological agen@@ da is very much at one with the spirit .
my ti@@ tle : &quot; que@@ er@@ er than we can supp@@ ose : the str@@ angen@@ ess of science . &quot;
so , a few years ago , i asked myself , &quot; can we take this one step further and treat other cancers , even in other species ? &quot;
and it creates a kind of stick@@ iness between the community and the company which is really , really powerful .
there are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
but what i &apos;m really worried about is war .
audience : ... aa@@ aa@@ aa@@ a@@ ah ... it@@ ay tal@@ g@@ am : so we &apos;ll have a little ch@@ at later .
computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated , but with my computer , i can communicate more widely than ever before .
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old sho@@ e .
we have had one of those in america for just about the entire post@@ war period .
four years ago , tech blog@@ gers and entrepren@@ eur@@ s jo@@ el sp@@ ol@@ sky and jeff at@@ wood , decided to start something called stack over@@ flow .
those d@@ ash@@ bo@@ ards the teachers have , you can go lo@@ g in right now and you can essentially become a co@@ ach for your kids , or ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the boys and girls club .
and if there is a parti@@ al answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine .
bren@@ é brown : listening to shame
they wanted us to be concer@@ ned about social issues .
so if you &apos;re driving on the free@@ way and you want to know where &apos;s the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
and now look at the ch@@ art .
how many american leaders use swe@@ dish web@@ ma@@ ils and cloud services ?
if you test men and women , and you ask them questions on totally obje@@ ctive cri@@ teria like g@@ p@@ as , men get it wrong slightly high , and women get it wrong slightly low .
female voice : see if you can inspi@@ re him to do any better .
let me tell you why this is so important .
my mother sent y@@ ams and rice , and our old clo@@ th@@ es , to his family .
so that leaves a couple of places like iran , maybe ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , that you would like to have very close sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce of anything that goes on with fis@@ si@@ le stuff .
because how we feel when we get du@@ mp@@ ed or win employe@@ e of the month depends on how we interpre@@ t that event .
and social play is part of what we &apos;re about here today , and is a by@@ product of the play scene .
and that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
s@@ s : she &apos;s also saying the name of that , with her voice .
and chris is a fis@@ her@@ man far@@ mer . both are gener@@ ali@@ sts .
now , relationship types can be negoti@@ ated .
and yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone .
and people who are teachers out here , who@@ ever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
but the key one really is the en@@ co@@ der alone , because we can team up the en@@ co@@ der with the different trans@@ du@@ cer .
what does that mean ?
what we look for in fire@@ men , in cli@@ mbers , in poli@@ ce@@ men , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk ta@@ kers -- not people who pl@@ un@@ ge blind off a cli@@ ff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who wei@@ gh their ris@@ ks , wei@@ gh their responsi@@ bilities .
umar was paralyzed for life .
i mean , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation .
and it can be fun ! that &apos;s the point of this talk -- it nee@@ dn &apos;t be steri@@ le . it nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically un@@ ten@@ able .
and then it got str@@ an@@ ger .
i &apos;m seven ft . , 2@@ ,000 l@@ bs . , with brown hair / eyes , long legs ...
consider , for example , a condition like epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy , where the brain is over@@ active .
it &apos;s a difficult thing ; it &apos;s a market@@ place which is very frag@@ mented and a consu@@ mer population with no income .
well , it &apos;s been down@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed four million times .
now , it turns out that i was pretty good at that .
there is no government to protect them .
and when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they e@@ mit light at particular colors .
and companies like navi@@ gen@@ ics and dna direct and 23@@ and@@ me , that are giving you your genetic pro@@ fil@@ es , are giving some people a sense of , &quot; g@@ os@@ h , well , what can i do about it ? &quot;
and now i want to talk about something entirely different .
and good slow is , you know , taking the time to eat a me@@ al with your family , with the tv swi@@ tched off .
the surgery was successful .
this is the view over times square , with the be@@ a@@ ver pon@@ d there , looking out toward the east .
so , al@@ b@@ eit a very small creature and very mo@@ dest , because it can ag@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate into these mega@@ -@@ re@@ e@@ f structures .
you know , it was -- like it happened in england , and germany , and it@@ al@@ y sort of all at the same time .
human growth has stra@@ ined the earth &apos;s resources , but as jo@@ han ro@@ ck@@ strom re@@ minds us , our advan@@ ces also give us the science to recognize this and change behavior . his research has found nine &quot; planet@@ ary boun@@ dar@@ ies &quot; that can guide us in prote@@ cting our planet &apos;s many over@@ l@@ apping ec@@ osyste@@ ms .
and if we change it , if we change our formul@@ a for happiness and success , what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality .
the person said , &quot; no , that &apos;s fine . &quot;
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the ex@@ act same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
the genom@@ ic sequence now exists for the entire pin@@ ot no@@ ir organis@@ m , and they identi@@ fied , once again , about 2@@ 9@@ ,000 genes .
audience : it@@ ay tal@@ g@@ am : good . now like a kar@@ a@@ j@@ an . since you &apos;re already trained , let me concent@@ rate , close my eyes . come , come .
i say , &quot; do you have passion ? &quot;
but they have those social skills .
it determin@@ es the type of voice you produce .
there &apos;s actually ambigu@@ ous evidence as to whether you find reci@@ pro@@ city in other animals , but the evidence for people could not be clear@@ er .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
we still have one foot in the dark ages .
there &apos;s also a field of prote@@ om@@ ics that i &apos;ll talk about in a few minutes , which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and clas@@ si@@ fying disease .
because if there &apos;s anything worse in the field of global public health , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s worse than allo@@ wing children on this planet to die of vaccin@@ e-@@ pre@@ vent@@ able diseases , diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar .
but you know , i have a problem with children &apos;s books : i think they &apos;re full of propa@@ ganda .
joseph and christ@@ ine , who run a phar@@ macy where they sell a number of these con@@ dom@@ s , said despite the fact that don@@ or agen@@ cies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campa@@ ig@@ ns that go along with them , their custom@@ ers don &apos;t buy the br@@ anded versi@@ ons .
the genocide happened in 199@@ 4 , seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream .
for those of you around in the &apos; 60s , you probably know it well .
there is all kinds of sort of plu@@ g-@@ and-@@ play kind of le@@ gos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tre@@ mor , ga@@ it , stri@@ de leng@@ th and those kinds of things .
but non@@ eth@@ eless , despite the ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty , fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters left the vehicle and success@@ fully f@@ ought the fire .
now how about exponenti@@ ally che@@ aper ?
but one thing is clear .
but among all those ideas that ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
why are you here ?
why ? because , as ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y tells us , we have no direct access to our physical world , other than through our sen@@ ses .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they rele@@ ase the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it .
and when i went to one of the clu@@ b@@ houses a couple years ago , i saw a 13@@ -year-old boy who was using our scratch software to create a game some@@ what like this one , and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game , but also he wanted to do more .
thank you very much .
so watch this individual here , and what he &apos;s trying to do is set up a nest .
well we were talking on the human mind this morning .
but what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before .
but it &apos;s maybe the con@@ vi@@ ction as mon@@ key and hom@@ un@@ cul@@ us we are .
so this morning at about seven o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , i decided that we &apos;d try to drive chris and the production cre@@ w here ber@@ ser@@ k by down@@ lo@@ ading all of our data from india again , so that you could see something that &apos;s just un@@ fol@@ ding today , which pro@@ ves that the impossible is possible .
and that pro@@ mp@@ ted people to make maps like this , with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land , but when you get to the wat@@ ers edge , the ocean looks like one giant pu@@ dd@@ le of blue paint .
or you get everything invented to yesterday , including facebook and your i@@ phone , but you have to give up , go out to the ou@@ thou@@ se , and carry in the water .
but to really see the details of the be@@ e , and really appreciate what it is , you have to look a little bit closer .
well , at that time -- i should go back .
i &apos;m going to talk briefly about two of them : the prisoner &apos;s dilemma and the tragedy of the common@@ s .
i want them to be mar@@ ines .
and i swa@@ m through that night and into the next day .
suddenly we have the dynamic in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy that puzz@@ led us .
so i &apos;ve come up with an alternative , which is si@@ top@@ ia , from the ancient gre@@ ek , &quot; si@@ tos &quot; for food , and &quot; top@@ os &quot; for place .
and if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size , but the resul@@ ting square that you get is three times bigger .
if you make some noise you can feel the effect .
i wish the 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people who really did mar@@ ch outside this very building knew these results .
it &apos;s one of the mysteri@@ es we still have , su@@ per fl@@ ar@@ es .
second , understanding society and culture .
the yellow line inclu@@ des an analy@@ s@@ is of 8@@ 7 decision ma@@ kers in iran , and a vast number of outside influ@@ en@@ cers trying to pressure iran into changing its behavior , various pla@@ yers in the united states , and egyp@@ t , and sau@@ di arab@@ ia , and russi@@ a , european union , japan , so on and so forth .
it &apos;s still there .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old : could this las@@ er za@@ p malaria ?
we are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing , community organi@@ zing , changing institutions from the inside out -- all continu@@ ing the incredible work that our mothers and grand@@ mothers started .
i enjo@@ yed eating food like &#91; unclear &#93; would come and ask me , &quot; yes ma &apos;@@ am , what you want ? &quot; it was so good to hear !
and i sat there for quite some time going , &quot; how am i going to get off this rock and go home ?
but in america , they &apos;ve co@@ ined this term , &quot; the human ipod &quot; for derek , which i think is just missing the point , really , because derek , you &apos;re so much more than an ipod .
and when you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;ve pretty much sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced any hope of making lots of money .
bf : richard you tell him , it &apos;s your last year .
but now i &apos;m going to move on .
so oil and pet@@ ro@@ chemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a sp@@ ill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
and my parents were part of a land@@ ed property family .
now that inclu@@ des the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .
so , we actually -- i showed that , at a conference , to president ab@@ du@@ l kal@@ am , at that time , and then he said , &quot; ok , we should use this in b@@ hab@@ ha atom@@ ic research cent@@ re for some use of that . &quot;
so we were home alone for eight years .
if you believe that infra@@ structures are not as important as many people believe , then you will put less em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on strong government .
this was a custom@@ -@@ made tou@@ ch-@@ screen keyboard .
y@@ r : first , to instru@@ ct a younger guy .
i mean , it is a ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le and it &apos;s growing really fast .
you are jo@@ ined by do@@ zens of your isra@@ el@@ i bro@@ thers and si@@ sters .
and our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers knew about this .
so we thought of an au@@ g@@ mented reality app@@ li@@ cation using a tab@@ let . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and since we mixed el@@ sewhere , i &apos;m pretty sure that one day , when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa , we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa .
and i bor@@ ro@@ wed these three ipo@@ ds from people here in the audience to show you what i mean .
f@@ g : that will be finished in 2003 -- september , oc@@ tober -- and i &apos;m hop@@ ing ky@@ u , and her@@ b@@ ie , and yo@@ -@@ yo and all those guys come play with us at that place .
and it &apos;s thought maybe it was a bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck , a genetic bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck thought to be 12@@ ,000 years ago , and this has caused a very low diversity .
i &apos;m going to show you something pretty unique .
phili@@ p z@@ im@@ bar@@ do : the de@@ mis@@ e of guys ?
we shu@@ t one down that was going to be big .
he saw them .
wei@@ ght@@ fully upon me was the world .
but they didn &apos;t believe me .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular ac@@ ute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
and we have taken pictures like this .
we know that our doctors and nur@@ ses and even social workers aren &apos;t enough , that the ti@@ cking minutes of health care are too con@@ stra@@ ining .
in fact , we may have some really interesting bre@@ ad and be@@ er as we go into this next century .
war@@ ren .
exactly what lo@@ an@@ ing means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and i think there are some cases .
there are no ro@@ ads there , so they carry lo@@ ads of stone on their bac@@ ks , often of their own weight , up and down the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya mountains .
why is that ? why can &apos;t we com@@ bine growing a mu@@ sta@@ che and doing something for men &apos;s health ?
and a man just star@@ ed at me , and he was like , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you use the internet ? &quot;
6@@ 5 million comp@@ act flu@@ ores@@ cent light bul@@ bs were sold last year .
well , this project , deep blue , put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected , and i want to pass it on to you , because i want you to refle@@ ct on this , perhaps in your own relationships .
we recently saw a case where some researchers made the h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 avi@@ an influ@@ enz@@ a virus more pot@@ ent .
and i ignor@@ ed every message because i don &apos;t have a pain re@@ lie@@ ver problem .
and that &apos;s the sc@@ ar@@ f whist@@ le , which is also associated with a visual symbol .
you can see that here by the different refle@@ ction on this side .
they &apos;re dele@@ ct@@ able muscle , rich in fat -- absolutely taste deli@@ cious .
one , you can make people actually se@@ cure and hope they notice .
the se@@ cular world is full of hol@@ es .
it was alive once , hun@@ ted , stol@@ en , stre@@ tched .
so his wish was to come with me , so that he had somewhere to live .
google is one of our big part@@ ners here .
and the off@@ ered them , for performance , three levels of re@@ wards : small reward , medium reward , large reward .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
well , how can the ted community help with this situation ?
is even larger .
it &apos;s like a bar@@ b@@ ie foot under this .
we can &apos;t get along with other people , even in our own families .
for politicians to be honest , the public needs to allow them to be honest , and the media , which medi@@ ates between the politicians and the public , needs to allow those politicians to be honest .
but car@@ l norden is really the one who cra@@ cks the code .
and that may be a sel@@ fish thing to think , but it &apos;s the way i &apos;ve been brought up .
of course we wanted to go back to israel and pal@@ est@@ ine .
color can anima@@ te simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i &apos;ll stop .
when someone can &apos;t see how one choice is unlike another , or when there are too many choices to compare and contr@@ ast , the process of cho@@ os@@ ing can be con@@ f@@ using and fru@@ str@@ ating .
the second thing , in addi@@ tion to really finally understanding the relationship between vulner@@ ability and courage , the second thing i learned is this : we have to talk about shame .
it had gone through , like , five or six families , and it was just a big thing for us , and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago .
they de@@ fer the pay@@ ments .
second ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t , s@@ ass@@ i and pan@@ no , do@@ di and di@@ ana , he@@ er and ran@@ j@@ ha , this is love ! third my greatest fear is ...
it said , &quot; money does does make me happy . &quot;
because we have this thing called priv@@ acy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hi@@ de , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then i know that i should not trust you with any secre@@ ts , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that glass cei@@ ling ?
i &apos;d like to dedi@@ cate this next song to car@@ mel@@ o , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .
now , there are two big reasons to be concer@@ ned about oil .
he told me that there had been two deaths ; the mother and child both had died .
and just last month the first f@@ da@@ -@@ appro@@ ved app@@ li@@ cation was appro@@ ved to allow radi@@ ologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .
i got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the san@@ itation trucks were par@@ ked on hou@@ ston street and ready to go down and start taking the rub@@ ble away .
it was hot . it wasn &apos;t hot enough .
let me give you a few numbers to place what &apos;s happening .
sb : must , at must . must , must .
and with the known physics etc , it &apos;s something actually which has been poin@@ ted out by frank dra@@ ke , many years ago , and sh@@ k@@ lov@@ sky .
the answer was clear : my brother bill . he was six .
it &apos;s har@@ dly time to rest on our lau@@ rel@@ s .
and if you ask what kind of situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people defin@@ ing people as ene@@ mi@@ es , it &apos;s a zero-@@ sum situation .
the great graphic designer paul r@@ and designed the i@@ b@@ m logo , the west@@ ing@@ house logo .
so one of the things -- both ser@@ ge@@ y and i went to a mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i school , and i think , for some reason , this has been in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated in google .
okay , got it . i don &apos;t want to talk stage one .
it &apos;s a sty@@ li@@ zed map of to@@ g@@ mor@@ den .
but first , see what a miser@@ able lot we are .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressi@@ ve , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
so this is the russi@@ ans working on the ice in the pe@@ ak of the si@@ ber@@ ian winter .
and so i can start this discus@@ sion in any number of places , and i &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en three or four to talk about .
i &apos;m going to ask you to do some more work .
they need your compassion .
and then she challenges all of her competi@@ tors to do the same .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- van@@ ity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
i took a side trip to the american museum , and i never re@@ covered .
how might the world end ? stephen pet@@ ran@@ ek la@@ ys out the challenges that face us in the drive to preser@@ ve the human race . will we be wi@@ ped out by an astero@@ id ? e@@ co@@ -@@ collapse ? how about a partic@@ le colli@@ der gone wild ?
there &apos;s a lot more arro@@ ws .
there &apos;s magic to love !
it &apos;s 20@@ ,000 dollars che@@ aper to build a medical school than to keep people in ja@@ il .
don &apos;t worry .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m interested in looking at the heart .
this ended up becoming a cover story at national geo@@ graphic .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to harvard in about three or four -- no , it &apos;s about two months from now -- to give a lec@@ ture .
and in this example , you can see that the components of this sta@@ ir are re@@ peti@@ tive , but they &apos;re re@@ peti@@ tive without being mod@@ ular .
this is a picture of a recent experiment we did -- actually not so recent anymore -- in sen@@ da@@ i shor@@ tly after the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke .
i use apple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
now i come from a very dat@@ a-@@ cent@@ ric reality , so we don &apos;t want that teacher to even go and inter@@ v@@ ene and have to ask the kid aw@@ k@@ ward questions : &quot; oh , what do you not understand ? &quot; or &quot; what do you do understand ? &quot;
there is a real problem with s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
its ti@@ tle -- &quot; the pal@@ ace at four in the morning -- 193@@ 2 .
and they didn &apos;t die because they didn &apos;t have anth@@ ra@@ x anymore .
and i think there are signs that it is beginning to change .
while he was there , he travel@@ ed to ma@@ dri@@ d , where he went to the pra@@ do to see this picture by the span@@ ish pain@@ ter die@@ go vel@@ á@@ z@@ que@@ z .
as if they were a re@@ p@@ tile .
so i want you to meet three of our students .
but i &apos;m talking about him because when he was four months old , my foreign edi@@ tor forced me to go back to ba@@ gh@@ dad where i had been repor@@ ting all throughout the sad@@ dam regi@@ me and during the fall of ba@@ gh@@ dad and after@@ wards , and i remember getting on the plane in tears , cr@@ ying to be separated from my son , and while i was there , a quite famous ira@@ q@@ i poli@@ tician who was a friend of mine said to me , &quot; what are you doing here ?
even in the 193@@ 0s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstra@@ ct art show had all of these works stopped by the cust@@ oms off@@ ic@@ ers that decided they were not art .
her wish was to make a pil@@ gri@@ mage to ti@@ be@@ t .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an acci@@ dent@@ al cli@@ ck by hit@@ ting the touch@@ pad -- you &apos;ll see him do that .
i actually want answers from you .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ?
how is that possible ?
what pic@@ as@@ so did , for example , was take the concept &quot; western art &quot; and the concept &quot; african mas@@ ks &quot; and bl@@ end them together -- not only the geom@@ etry , but the moral systems ent@@ a@@ iled in them .
he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our condu@@ ct , and then it is our du@@ ty to follow those rules .
what makes them great is the degree to which they use their sk@@ at@@ e@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding to individu@@ ate themselves .
the impact for teachers would be phenomen@@ al .
in fact , if you think about it , chinese food is the most per@@ v@@ asive food on the planet , served on all seven contin@@ ents , even ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a , because mon@@ day night is chinese food night at mc@@ mur@@ do station , which is the main scientific station in ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
the resul@@ ting shift to electric autos is going to be as gam@@ e-@@ changing as shifting from ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ters to the gains in computers .
the central nervous system ner@@ ves , there is no cure .
and you can fall , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
this has never been done before .
well , at this point i just wanted to give these two boys some ad@@ vice about their pit@@ ch .
i mean you probably saw these head@@ lines . this is ca@@ ther@@ ine cas@@ ey who is the first bo@@ om@@ er to actually get social security .
i think i only heard five numbers . i -- wait -- 4@@ 4@@ 8@@ 75 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
and these ted@@ sters are -- you know , as inno@@ cent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthrop@@ ists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hur@@ ry . she &apos;s got food .
as we ne@@ ared , an@@ gry crow@@ ds attac@@ ked our trucks and st@@ oned them , by hundreds of people all over the place .
but it &apos;s worth it .
and i think it &apos;s probably in the diver@@ gent mo@@ de that we most need play@@ ful@@ ness .
because these different languages imp@@ ose a bar@@ rier , as we &apos;ve just seen , to the trans@@ fer of goo@@ ds and ideas and technologies and wisdom .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
what is the lesson from all of this ?
that &apos;s a 12@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long giant si@@ x@@ g@@ ill shark .
jo : who knows what that is ? u@@ h , pe@@ ar ?
in this country , and across the glo@@ be , hundreds and thousands of children , as young as three , as young as four , are sold into sexual s@@ la@@ very .
the standard numbers are that lif@@ es@@ p@@ ans have been growing at between one and two years per decade .
&apos;@@ me@@ mo@@ s are vis@@ it@@ ations , &apos; i infor@@ med them .
and when they finished that , we said , &quot; would you like to build another one , this time for 30 cents less ? &quot;
but as you look at it , i hope you &apos;ll begin to feel just slightly un@@ easy .
and so basically , he thought he was de@@ aling with something smart , and of course , you know , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out , and it didn &apos;t quite work , and we don &apos;t have this feature anymore .
probably su@@ mm@@ ed up in a way by the sty@@ li@@ sh or alternative available here , as we gener@@ ously had gif@@ ted at lun@@ ch@@ time , the &#91; unclear &#93; , which is a further kind of development -- and again , inspired by the incredible sort of sen@@ su@@ al feel .
well , we can learn a lot because our education systems are fa@@ iling des@@ perat@@ ely in many ways .
i was thro@@ wn from the car . and i wo@@ ke up in a head injury re@@ hab ward , and i had been with@@ dra@@ wn from college , and i learned that my i.@@ q@@ . had dropped by two standard de@@ vi@@ ations , which was very trau@@ matic .
the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world , there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were .
now , here &apos;s the vir@@ gin mary made her appe@@ ar@@ ance on a che@@ ese sandwich -- which i got to actually hold in a las vegas cas@@ in@@ o , of course , this being america .
dep@@ th@@ x is an all-@@ seeing eye@@ ball .
because in visual illu@@ sions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes ; in cogni@@ tive illusion it &apos;s much , much harder to demonstrate to people the mistakes .
some things are missing .
here &apos;s r@@ he@@ x enter@@ ing the woo@@ ds .
and by this weird qu@@ ir@@ k of alphab@@ e@@ tical order of the nations , a lot of the low-@@ lying states , like kiribati and n@@ au@@ r@@ u , they were se@@ ated at the very end of these immen@@ sely long ro@@ ws .
the lab@@ eling in this country is a dis@@ gra@@ ce .
&quot; ev@@ an willi@@ ams , give people more good ways to share information and follow your h@@ unch at ted . &quot;
when you ask the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors who beha@@ ved like the ones i descri@@ bed how hard it is to learn to do their job , they tell you that it takes lots of experience .
and then he died , and there was no more spin@@ o@@ za . extinct .
it &apos;s not only because we like to drink lots of it , and its mar@@ vel@@ ous deri@@ va@@ tives , be@@ er , w@@ ine , etc .
so in our common language , du@@ tch , the name for t@@ .@@ b .
well , in ancient ro@@ me , im@@ pen@@ etr@@ ability was the cri@@ teri@@ on of ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity .
so this car seat was actually an abo@@ ve-@@ average car seat from consu@@ mer repor@@ ts , and did quite well .
oh yeah . he says , &quot; you start when you can &apos;t stand it anymore . &quot;
and that was enor@@ m@@ ously liber@@ ating to me .
in 197@@ 3 , with the oil em@@ bar@@ go and the clos@@ ing of the gold window , that was the end of america .
it &apos;s not quite the ted prize , but it is an ex@@ clu@@ sive t-@@ shirt from our lab .
also , the system is self-@@ fu@@ eling .
and the entire 2@@ ,000 people went absolutely crazy .
when the bu@@ g was in the gut , he &apos;d send back by return pos@@ t some dung be@@ et@@ les .
now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics despite the fact that they come from very different environ@@ ments .
let &apos;s start with the water .
they , that one , is ha@@ ir@@ y and walking on four legs .
and she said , &quot; well , you know , i think i &apos;d kind of like to live my whole life in the cave . &quot;
if you want to believe one particular one of them -- un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns or to@@ oth fa@@ i@@ ries or te@@ ap@@ ots or y@@ ah@@ we@@ h -- the on@@ us is on you to say why .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
it took them 10 full prototyp@@ es to get something that would actually fly .
the per@@ cent@@ age of adults who are working age dro@@ ps dra@@ matically .
my god ! what a bon@@ ding exercise that was .
but here &apos;s the deal .
but you could ask , how could these large ma@@ mm@@ als live in this desert environment ?
the problem with ec@@ osyste@@ ms is that we understand them so poor@@ ly , that we don &apos;t know they &apos;re really in trou@@ ble until it &apos;s almost too late .
for those of you who think that new media of the internet could somehow help us aver@@ t genocide , should look no further than rwand@@ a , where in the &apos; 9@@ 0s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fu@@ eling much of the eth@@ ni@@ c hat@@ red in the first place .
and what do you dedi@@ cate it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
so let &apos;s sort of think about this . i think we have to compare -- — we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do .
he was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goo@@ ds , but he had a sense of his own hero@@ ic journey , which i believe we are all born into . he said , &quot; probably i can &apos;t do everything .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
this was the new york bike mes@@ sen@@ ger meeting the tour de fr@@ ance .
and although adults may not be quite at the level of tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian regi@@ mes , kids have no , or very little say in making the rules , when really the at@@ titude should be reci@@ pro@@ cal , meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wi@@ shes of the younger population .
if the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken an@@ kle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asth@@ ma .
l@@ oren ei@@ sel@@ ey has said , &quot; one does not meet on@@ es@@ el@@ f until one cat@@ ches the refle@@ ction from an eye other than human . &quot;
and one day i had a -- oh , well , the other way .
i think this is , obviously , substan@@ ti@@ ally different from anything we &apos;d ever thought about doing before , just by the nature of it .
but if india gro@@ ws at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 20@@ 50 .
if they want to mix up a ca@@ ke , they &apos;re doing it by hand .
but if you d@@ are to re@@ t@@ we@@ et or mention any fa@@ ke cou@@ p about beijing , you definitely will be ar@@ re@@ sted .
supp@@ ose you were deci@@ ding the justice of this case .
so , one day , cattle in a pen .
and just watch the facial expres@@ sions as they move the sli@@ der .
so what we did was that we conver@@ ted this device into a medical device .
it &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
and let me show you what &apos;s behind it .
and it was -- the para@@ dox is that you &apos;re in free@@ zing cold water , but actually you &apos;re on fire .
which group los@@ es the most weight , we give them pri@@ zes .
or , what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time , and do so in an environ@@ ment@@ ally fri@@ end@@ ly way ?
because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day .
it was tra@@ cked for 43 days , swimming 1,@@ 700 kilome@@ ters , or more than 1@@ ,000 miles .
it &apos;s a small message from us , in our own small way to the ene@@ mi@@ es of humanity , of islam , of south asia , of india , and of pakistan , that humanity will continue to blo@@ om , ir@@ respe@@ ctive of such da@@ star@@ dly attacks .
and finally , it &apos;s the freedom that america represents , not just to me , as an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , but to everyone in the world . thank you .
so in the wise , 15 years ago , we started out and said , &quot; well wow , there &apos;s a couple of key ob@@ serva@@ tions and we should probably follow up on that . &quot;
rather , that all men are equal in terms of their rights , and that every person ought to be treated as an individual , and not pre@@ jud@@ ged by the statistics of particular groups that they may bel@@ ong to .
in real wonder , two years later , i was able to collect 5@@ 0,000 u.s. dollars .
don &apos;t go asking for a fr@@ ap@@ pu@@ c@@ cin@@ o there .
and that &apos;s not what the debate should be about .
meet some mates in the pu@@ b for an early ev@@ ening drink .
john la gro@@ u un@@ vei@@ ls an in@@ geni@@ ous new technology that will smar@@ ten up the electri@@ cal out@@ lets in our hom@@ es , using micro@@ process@@ ors and r@@ fi@@ d tags . the invention , sa@@ fe@@ plu@@ g , promis@@ es to prevent de@@ ad@@ ly acci@@ d@@ ents like house fir@@ es -- and to con@@ serve energy .
well i can tell you , it &apos;s quite a few of them .
this is the size .
you &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
so suddenly , i was interested in human@@ -@@ powered f@@ light -- -- and did not -- the way i approach@@ ed it , first , thinking about ways to make the plan@@ es , was just like they &apos;d been doing in england , and not succe@@ eding , and i gave it up . i figured , nah , there isn &apos;t any simple , easy way .
that su@@ cks . why not le@@ vel@@ -@@ up ?
well it turns out that yes , the different tas@@ ks are inter@@ dependent .
spec@@ tat@@ or play , ritual play -- we &apos;re involved in some of that .
that leads to produ@@ ctivity .
calcul@@ ate the vi@@ bra@@ tions , the pur@@ ple spectrum is that new fel@@ low , the white one is the old one .
and for one year in the u.s. alone , it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that it &apos;s going to cost 22 billion u.s. dollars , if we re@@ move bat@@ s . so indeed , bat@@ s then do bring us wealth .
what would happen if auth@@ ors , or people with ideas could use version two , which comes out on mon@@ day , and use it to organize people who want to talk about something .
and we found activity in a lot of brain regi@@ ons .
we sur@@ ve@@ yed the top@@ -@@ 20 ni@@ el@@ sen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows .
just with@@ ering in her con@@ temp@@ t .
up to now their counter@@ -@@ terrorism policy has been to kill insur@@ g@@ ents at almost any cost , and if civili@@ ans get in the way , that &apos;s written as &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage . &quot;
and i reach@@ ed down and pi@@ cked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impres@@ sed by its speed and its streng@@ th and a@@ gi@@ li@@ ty .
they start over here , they love people &apos;s eyes , and it re@@ ma@@ ins quite stable .
basically , it ends up as &quot; god is on a bicycle with his angel@@ s . &quot;
rs : was i@@ van being mean and n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty for taking jos@@ hu@@ a &apos;s sandwich ?
you were there , maybe , on the night of his vi@@ ctory .
they didn &apos;t say money .
now , fish like to stay close together , about a body leng@@ th apart .
you get access to distance medicine .
there are also real business benefits .
it &apos;s com@@ posed of four sub@@ un@@ its : a , c , g and t , we call them .
your heart starts be@@ ating faster .
the most fun thing i ever did in my life , the most moving .
what about the other aspects of living systems ?
so another one of bo@@ b m@@ ck@@ im &apos;s favorite exer@@ cis@@ es is called the &quot; 30 cir@@ cles test . &quot;
i have just found the je@@ wish prin@@ ce char@@ ming of my family &apos;s dreams .
if i have a hundred of these , a hundred of those , it doesn &apos;t make any difference what these and those are .
i don &apos;t want to do something like this if it &apos;s going to go away after i &apos;m vot@@ ed out of office . &quot;
women get inti@@ macy from fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face talking .
now if you po@@ ke it , it pul@@ ls in its t@@ ent@@ ac@@ les .
now , you have all been at a mall during the ho@@ li@@ days , yes ?
that &apos;s not one of your five steps . &quot;
and we can predict what the sound will be .
&#91; hawa@@ i@@ ian ch@@ ant &#93; when they finish , they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them .
these are ca@@ vern@@ ous rock structures that i found on the site in so@@ ko@@ to .
maybe he ate something bad for l@@ unch , and then things get really hor@@ ri@@ ble , as his skin ri@@ ps apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his in@@ sides .
but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other .
so , what about that ? well , here &apos;s a couple of things .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
all of this stuff starts moving into industry .
how are you going to repli@@ cate ? &quot;
what looks like mos@@ s cover@@ ing rocks is actually a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b com@@ pris@@ ed of thousands of bran@@ ches , each contain@@ ing clu@@ sters of tiny green leaves at the end and so den@@ sely pac@@ ked together that you could actually stand on top of it .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s sub@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
this is je@@ an v@@ ani@@ er .
my talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about .
&quot; because the colors you have or@@ dered do not meet european standards , &quot; he repli@@ ed .
within a year , ra@@ infor@@ est cr@@ unch was on the shel@@ ves .
so i went out and i started with the kids .
and we syste@@ matically field tested , because in the field testing we learned some important lessons , and we went through many i@@ ter@@ ations .
well , you can see what &apos;s coming next .
ti@@ med de@@ gra@@ da@@ tion : pac@@ ka@@ ging that is good until you don &apos;t want it to be good anymore , and dis@@ sol@@ ves on cu@@ e .
h@@ mm ? look at the world@@ view you &apos;ve given yourself .
this is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ inesses , tradition@@ ally .
and if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that tor@@ que , we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly fac@@ ing situ@@ ations which are simply un@@ thin@@ k@@ able .
english mother : ah , i love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice .
we fund@@ raised , we got some black@@ bo@@ ards , we put &quot; incredible edi@@ ble &quot; on the top , we gave it every market tra@@ der that was s@@ elling lo@@ cally , and they scri@@ b@@ bled on what they were s@@ elling in any one week .
and the first wee@@ k@@ end i spent with them -- the first of many -- i recorded more than 20 hours of conversation .
this is a pretty ev@@ en@@ ly distribu@@ ted scan .
and i remember reading that book , and at 3 in the morning i was reading this book and it was expla@@ ining how the an@@ ten@@ n@@ as i was using to measure the sp@@ ins of galaxies could also be used to communicate , to send bits of information from one star system to another .
that &apos;s the end of that .
so , what br@@ ands can do , and companies , is pay divi@@ den@@ ds to con@@ sumers , be a brand that la@@ sts , off@@ er transpar@@ ency , promise you &apos;re going to be there beyond today &apos;s s@@ ale .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand c@@ any@@ on .
i &apos;d be -- you know , i &apos;d be sk@@ i@@ pping lines here , para@@ graph@@ s there , sometimes a whole page , and of course , my little boy knew the book inside out , so we would quar@@ re@@ l .
and we got that gift back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s when women entered the labor force .
so , there &apos;s so much inter@@ play here .
y@@ ak@@ im@@ a can@@ utt really for@@ med the stunt fight .
that &apos;s 75 percent .
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
can you start to find the hot spots to see the dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies between someone &apos;s words and someone &apos;s actions ?
a sky@@ ro@@ ck@@ eting dem@@ and for food means that agriculture has become the largest dri@@ ver of climate change , bio@@ diversity loss and environmental destruction . at tedx@@ t@@ c j@@ on@@ a@@ than fo@@ ley shows why we des@@ perat@@ ely need to begin &quot; ter@@ ra@@ culture &quot; -- far@@ ming for the whole planet . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
he started a computer tour@@ nam@@ ent for people to sub@@ mit prisoner &apos;s dilemma strategi@@ es and discovered , much to his surprise , that a very , very simple strategy won -- it won the first tour@@ nam@@ ent , and even after everyone knew it won , it won the second tour@@ nam@@ ent -- that &apos;s known as ti@@ t for tat .
one striking recent case that we &apos;ve investig@@ ated is how the government in the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go sold off a series of valu@@ able , state-@@ ow@@ ned min@@ ing asse@@ ts to shell companies in the british vir@@ gin is@@ lands .
now at that time , there was a great , as you can imagine , frustration -- let &apos;s call it frustration -- it started to grow very , very quickly .
these are the eyes of a living an@@ gl@@ er@@ fish .
but what &apos;s it &apos;s doing is sharing data .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
the third reason , i won &apos;t go into .
this process of dis@@ covery is a wonderful advent@@ ure to be involved in .
this might stri@@ ke you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advan@@ tage : no job competition .
on the one hand , we have mathema@@ tic@@ a , with its sort of pre@@ cise , for@@ mal language and a huge network of carefully designed cap@@ abilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
smart infrastructure can provide co@@ st-@@ saving ways for m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ alities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
why do we do this ? because we have to , we have to make a choice , do i look here or do i look here ?
a time for pl@@ ot@@ ting to wh@@ ack the ch@@ ie@@ f of police , like in this clas@@ sic scene from &quot; the go@@ d@@ father . &quot;
this project worked well because we engaged all the sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from in@@ ception of an idea through innovation , v@@ ali@@ da@@ tion , commer@@ ci@@ alization and dis@@ semin@@ ation , and that cycle has to start and end with end us@@ ers .
if you were an edu@@ cated child , you would know how to not only use the astro@@ lab@@ e , you would also know how to make an astro@@ lab@@ e .
the majority going to something we call the leg@@ acy fund .
and i write a new@@ sle@@ tter that goes out every week , and i wrote an article about this , and it got such enormous response that i realized that design , that common design , that &apos;s in the public area means a lot to people , and establi@@ shes kind of a gro@@ und@@ work and a dialog .
the assu@@ mption then that we do best when the individual self cho@@ os@@ es only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
and they influ@@ enced that , and this next piece , which i &apos;ll do a little se@@ gment of .
we &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rated shows over the course of 50 years .
198@@ 2 -- i don &apos;t know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of ty@@ len@@ ol pois@@ on@@ ings in the united states .
when kab@@ il@@ a started his movement to liber@@ ate con@@ go , so mo@@ bu@@ t@@ u soldiers started moving and re@@ treated .
what is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? in this qui@@ et@@ ly moving talk , writer andrew sol@@ om@@ on shares what he learned from talking to do@@ zens of parents -- asking them : what &apos;s the line between un@@ condi@@ tional love and un@@ condi@@ tional accep@@ tan@@ ce ?
so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goo@@ ds , things from which all of us can benef@@ it ?
as the h@@ unter@@ s dis@@ play their kills , something surprising happens .
this morning , some of the speak@@ ers named the date when they found out about their condition .
one fifth of human kind depend on fish to live .
w@@ 1 : they su@@ ck .
av : yes , you can see where the dis@@ connect was happening for us .
and it is essenti@@ al to balance , to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us .
and it &apos;s not because people were happy or people were not fru@@ str@@ ated .
so take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products .
and you don &apos;t need the three billi@@ on-@@ dollar ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der for doing this .
now -- -- so we now know that we are able to trans@@ fer enormous amount of curr@@ ents inside super@@ condu@@ ctors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in mri machines , partic@@ le acceler@@ ators and so on .
so flies love this .
i myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom i de@@ arly love .
it &apos;s not something i was very happy about .
the question is , what &apos;s the good you can do with it ?
we felt like we were surro@@ gate parents .
de@@ pri@@ ve your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
tri@@ ta par@@ s@@ i : iran and israel : peace is possible
where is the will ?
x-ray diagra@@ m , he thought was compar@@ able with the heli@@ x .
they didn &apos;t have tv scre@@ ens , and they didn &apos;t have any foot@@ ball games to watch .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
what if , pla@@ to thought , eth@@ ics was like math ?
once you get to that point where you know it &apos;s going to happen , you need to start thinking about how you &apos;re going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you &apos;re going to fall onto the rop@@ e , or if you &apos;re cli@@ mb@@ ing without a rop@@ e , fall to a place where you can actually control the fall .
they are curious .
&quot; i want to say one word to you , just one word . &quot;
here &apos;s an example .
and his father said , &quot; i sure do .
thank you very much .
at the same time , we need to think lo@@ cally , which is the joy and mar@@ vel of syl@@ vi@@ a &apos;s hope spot wish , is that we can sh@@ ine a sp@@ ot@@ light on many of these previ@@ ously un@@ known areas , and to bring people to the table , if you will , to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a sta@@ ke in their future mana@@ gement .
so here &apos;s all@@ an teaching an engli@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minim@@ ally inv@@ asive surgery .
in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s when i started , i got right down in the ch@@ utes to see what cattle were seeing .
it isn &apos;t when the sh@@ iny new tools show up that their uses start per@@ me@@ ating society .
number eight : the ecosystem collap@@ ses .
ah yes , a table .
and so as people get health@@ ier , they also get weal@@ th@@ ier .
and as it turns out , content matters a lot .
but look what happened at 10 : 0@@ 6 after we re@@ moved this pig &apos;s medi@@ cation that kept him from having a heart attack .
it &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity , a whole range of things .
he showed it in paris in 18@@ 6@@ 7 , and it was a major achiev@@ ement because it brought the power density of the engine way up .
we can start to make poverty history .
so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
fif@@ ty years later , as a tribu@@ te , the international space station , which is still up there tonight , syn@@ ced its orbit with ga@@ gar@@ in &apos;s orbit , at the ex@@ act same time of day , and fil@@ med it , so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zing ride , possibly a lon@@ ely one , the first person to ever see such a thing .
another case : last ele@@ ction cycle , i was following mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney around new h@@ amp@@ shi@@ re , and he was campa@@ ig@@ ning with his five perfect sons : bi@@ p , chip , ri@@ p , zi@@ p , li@@ p and di@@ p .
one of them actually , fit@@ t@@ ingly enough , found me when i che@@ cked into a del@@ i at a restaurant in new york on four@@ square .
and what &apos;s happening here , this is where you &apos;ve actually ele@@ cted to join that ni@@ ke community . you &apos;ve bought into it .
on the neuro@@ logi@@ cal caus@@ es of dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ia in children that i en@@ counter@@ ed a star@@ t@@ ling fact that i &apos;d like to share with you all today .
it &apos;s keeping the lights on .
the ide@@ o@@ graph that i talked to you about before , what is it for &quot; the tempest &quot; ?
i was forced to leave the democratic re@@ public of the con@@ go , my home , where i was a student ac@@ tivist .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
so part of my thinking , and part of my wi@@ shes , is sitting with these thou@@ ghts in mind , and thinking about , &quot; how is their life going to be when they want to have children , or when they &apos;re ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever , 15 years from now ? &quot;
some designers don &apos;t design objects , products , things that we &apos;re going to actually use , but rather , they design scen@@ ari@@ os that are obje@@ ct@@ -@@ based .
not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
that &apos;s how it seems to us .
and just before alex died at the age of 9@@ 6 , he gave me a gift .
so we &apos;ve got that . you could call it a mos@@ qui@@ to factory .
what animal species creates this civilization ?
and i took the head@@ master to task and then i also wrote an on@@ going story about a boy named wes@@ ley who was un@@ lucky in love , and i just s@@ wor@@ e up and down that this wasn &apos;t about me , but all these years later it was totally me .
but over four generations , he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a ta@@ sting men@@ u .
i didn &apos;t know that .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
but here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
at the same time , our de@@ bt level &apos;s gone up to 120 and we &apos;re all feeling slightly miser@@ able as a result .
so how do we look at this question experiment@@ ally ?
that &apos;s enough to stick six 4@@ 2-@@ in@@ ch pl@@ as@@ ma tv &apos;s to your wall , no na@@ ils .
any sty@@ le -- yeah , good .
the public health auth@@ orities had largely ignor@@ ed what he had to say .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
because when i was a kid , i also played a lot of gu@@ it@@ ar .
over a million north kor@@ e@@ ans died of star@@ vation in that time , and in 2003 , when i was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
this photograph was taken by dr. eu@@ an ma@@ son in new ze@@ al@@ and last year , and it was sub@@ mit@@ ted and published in national geo@@ graphic .
then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dres@@ s or something .
take her to a dance school . &quot;
they could have a mental image of the cell as a large , bu@@ st@@ ling , hu@@ gely complicated city that &apos;s occu@@ pi@@ ed by micro@@ -@@ machines .
yet actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal .
i mean , it d@@ war@@ fs , d@@ war@@ fs everything that is actually on our news agen@@ da , and it &apos;s invisible .
it &apos;s not really all that much data .
does this sound familiar to you ?
and i said , well , that &apos;s fine ; i just would love to have your in@@ put on this film and this book , and he finally agre@@ ed to it .
they get no great pleasure from what they do .
do we pur@@ sue happiness with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ?
it &apos;s amazing how much children can teach .
from the simpl@@ est version in nature , one bran@@ ch , my engineering collabor@@ ator , r@@ on fe@@ aring , at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , had made the first synthetic version .
the last ch@@ ap@@ ter in any successful genocide is the one in which the op@@ pres@@ s@@ or can re@@ move their hands and say , &quot; my god , what are these people doing to themselves ?
e@@ bay solved the prisoner &apos;s dilemma and created a market where none would have exist@@ ed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner &apos;s dilemma game into an as@@ sur@@ ance game .
it ties to origami . so let me start .
but that day , when i asked that question , i learned something , and that was that i &apos;d grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right , when in fact it &apos;s a privi@@ lege .
and this is the question : who am i being , that my pla@@ yers &apos; eyes are not sh@@ ining ?
you know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things .
and what would it do to our economy ?
so i wrote a book on my research .
and he says , &quot; hey mi@@ ke .
this is amazing , i think .
you create pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er learning , or you create par@@ a-@@ teachers , or you bring in speci@@ alist skills .
i have a hard time en@@ visi@@ oning a future in which someone is saying , &quot; where , oh where , can i find a picture of a cute c@@ at ? &quot;
char@@ ley : i &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
and so dis@@ semin@@ ating that information to around the rest of africa is important .
you all , i guess , like me , enjoy watching a bal@@ let dan@@ cer dance .
this is a very serious talk .
industrial tra@@ w@@ lers and dra@@ g@@ gers are sc@@ rap@@ ing the sea flo@@ or like bu@@ ll@@ do@@ z@@ ers , taking everything in their path .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
we need to force people to publi@@ sh all trials condu@@ cted in humans , including the older trials , because the f@@ da am@@ end@@ ment act only as@@ ks that you publi@@ sh the trials condu@@ cted after 2008 , and i don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only prac@@ tic@@ ing medicine on the basis of trials that comple@@ ted in the past two years .
and actually what &apos;s quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bes@@ po@@ ke products en masse .
den@@ dri@@ tic cells , or mac@@ rop@@ ha@@ ges , capture the virus and dis@@ play pieces of it .
and the audience just -- you know , they &apos;re always on the side of the intervie@@ we@@ e , and they felt that this was a kind of as@@ sau@@ lt , but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life .
recent sur@@ ve@@ ys show that 9@@ 2 percent of veter@@ ans want to continue their service when they take off their uni@@ form .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
and there &apos;s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grand@@ ma .
it has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
the next con@@ c@@ ern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the wa@@ ist down .
you can &apos;t put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fi@@ x my hair .
who is she ?
these little , fat du@@ m@@ pl@@ ings , 15@@ 0-@@ po@@ und b@@ und@@ les of blu@@ b@@ ber are the main@@ stay of the pol@@ ar bear .
in this map from mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good edu@@ ca@@ tional outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
30 million ri@@ des have been shared on car@@ po@@ ol@@ ing@@ .com .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
now this is 24 / 7 living , hal@@ f-@@ a-@@ dozen people who &apos;d left their -- some had left their wi@@ ves behind and families behind , and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america , but the first three months were the most inten@@ sive .
so of course , when you edu@@ cate a girl , she tends to get married later on in life , she tends to have kids later on in life , she tends to have fewer kids , and those kids that she does have , she edu@@ c@@ ates them in a more en@@ ligh@@ tened fashion .
one of the reasons i tell you about ants is because of my husband , who is in fact an ant tax@@ on@@ om@@ ist and when we got married , he promised to name an ant after me , which he did -- pro@@ cryp@@ to@@ cer@@ us n@@ al@@ ini , a canopy ant .
you can also r@@ ank it by the lat@@ est po@@ sts .
it &apos;s a phenomen@@ al thing . it &apos;s the equi@@ valent of 2,@@ 500 t@@ g@@ v tra@@ ins , and just think , they didn &apos;t have to lay a track or buy a car .
but this dog cancer is quite remarkable , because it spread all around the world .
and so this is what you do : you have a fre@@ e-@@ sty@@ le artist come in and memor@@ ize a rap that you write for them , that they &apos;ve never heard before , and then you have them fre@@ e-@@ sty@@ le .
by now i know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
so we &apos;re going to just type a couple of random words into twitter .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sensor@@ y experience for the patient .
my hero is actually not dar@@ win ; it &apos;s a guy named willi@@ am bat@@ eson , father of gre@@ g bat@@ eson , who was here for a long time in monterey .
this is one of my favorite fe@@ atures in section one .
now , i &apos;m going to sum up a year &apos;s worth of work in two sent@@ ences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
that &apos;s the kind of out@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ box science that i love doing , for the bet@@ ter@@ ment of man@@ kind , but especially for her , so that she can grow up in a world without malaria . thank you .
so we just started making a list .
and the whit@@ ney is moving down@@ town and is building their new museum right at the base of the high line .
he is the main bu@@ yer of u.s. tre@@ as@@ ury bon@@ ds .
she wanted a dom@@ e somewhere in the house .
so let &apos;s see what some of those inven@@ tions were .
it &apos;s been 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 years since this happened .
so that whole thing , that whole childhood e@@ cho@@ es and takes me into the next piece .
and this is a picture of h@@ ong n@@ g@@ u , viet@@ na@@ m today .
what about the clinic ?
and space is a great example of that .
and at google , as many of you know , about half of the new products in a typical year are bir@@ th@@ ed during that 20 percent time : things like g@@ mail , or@@ ku@@ t , google news .
this is bigger than the state of ari@@ zon@@ a .
but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; what would have happened if this dr@@ unken guy was not in that condition ?
why did this have to get in the way of all that ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s rational .
he &apos;s got a small res@@ i@@ du@@ al li@@ mb on one side .
their marketing is slightly different .
&quot; you want some fro@@ zen yog@@ urt ?
all living white ti@@ gers in north america are the result of sel@@ ec@@ tive in@@ bre@@ eding -- that would be mother to son , father to daughter , sister to brother -- to allow for the genetic conditions that create a sal@@ able white tiger .
we &apos;re starting to see these happening all around the world .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country &apos;s dis@@ integration .
this is a nin@@ e-@@ year-old girl navi@@ g@@ ating to princi@@ p@@ ally children &apos;s sites .
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , exc@@ ell@@ ent .
if you try to do that for the moon , you &apos;re going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a cre@@ w out there .
let &apos;s go all over the world and photograph every single sl@@ um around the world . &quot;
think about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
it was a trying and sc@@ ary thing for a young kid to be going through .
and however we define a@@ thei@@ sm , it &apos;s surely the kind of academic belief that a person is enti@@ tled to hold without being vili@@ fied as an un@@ patri@@ otic , un@@ ele@@ ct@@ able non-@@ citi@@ zen .
and he will , or she will , calcul@@ ate the opti@@ mal design of the no@@ zz@@ le .
so in this dilemma about re@@ con@@ c@@ iling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that i &apos;ve come to understand er@@ otic cou@@ ples do .
text : you can say a story is fabri@@ cated .
two : do the middle eastern charac@@ ters lau@@ gh or s@@ mile without showing the whit@@ es of their eyes ?
disappe@@ ars right into the background .
now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
today the general is a b@@ ap@@ ti@@ zed chri@@ sti@@ an ev@@ ange@@ list .
for@@ give me , for i know not what i do . &apos; eventually , i broke down in front of friends , and everybody convinced me to take more medi@@ cation .
which is not to be con@@ f@@ used with the five sac@@ red sal@@ ads .
kei@@ th sch@@ acht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
there are four pictures .
they certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
so i ask , &quot; what would move t , technology , from the nu@@ mer@@ ator -- call it t@@ 1 -- where it increases impact , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator -- call it t@@ 2 -- where it redu@@ ces impact ?
and in-@@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of medi@@ ta@@ tive quiet in bed .
hold on .
and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fet@@ us .
okay . let &apos;s try that .
because i was , sort of , up@@ set about this lam@@ ani@@ te story and this crazy gold plate story , but the truth was , i hadn &apos;t really thought this through , so i back@@ pe@@ d@@ al@@ ed a little and i said , &quot; well , what exactly do you mean by ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ?
over the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours a day , a@@ mas@@ sing roughly a quar@@ ter-@@ million hours of multi@@ -@@ track audi@@ o and video .
but the acade@@ mi@@ cians couldn &apos;t understand anything that he wrote .
but they want it to be easy , aff@@ ord@@ able and attra@@ ctive , and they expect business to help , and they &apos;re a little bit dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted today .
so i want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s puzz@@ les can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
no need of sta@@ ying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . &quot;
in other words , i &apos;ve taken off@@ -@@ the-@@ shelf components , and i &apos;ve made a spec@@ tros@@ cope .
we didn &apos;t calcul@@ ate that precisely , but we understand that &apos;s very expensive .
pm : na@@ dia , i think you &apos;ve just given us a very different view of yemen .
okay , look at that . it &apos;s a dar@@ k@@ slide .
and i started to cr@@ y .
really important .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
it is ourselves we are heal@@ ing .
yes , point five , ok , ok , ok ! i &apos;m a designer , that &apos;s all , of christ@@ mas gif@@ ts .
so i asked everybody in my life what they thought .
thank you .
and i told you earlier that we may want to emplo@@ y lots and lots of robots to over@@ come the limit@@ ations of size .
those of you who remember al gore , during the first term and then during his successful but un@@ ele@@ cted run for the pres@@ iden@@ cy , may remember him as being kind of woo@@ den and not entirely his own person , at least in public .
as you saw a little bit earlier , when we were doing the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x one , we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be fac@@ ing .
what made me stop in my tra@@ cks about her to begin with was just the gor@@ ge@@ ous colors he uses and the light fall@@ ing on her face .
thank you .
this is serious business . this ain &apos;t no fun .
musi@@ cian and ac@@ tivist peter gab@@ ri@@ el shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the wat@@ ch@@ dog group wit@@ ness -- and tells stories of citi@@ zen journalists in action .
so if the tele@@ phone is a production tool , then we don &apos;t quite have to worry about the pur@@ ch@@ asing power .
and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another , to change geom@@ etry into language .
the next bit in si@@ ber@@ ia to kr@@ as@@ no@@ y@@ ar@@ s@@ k , on a russi@@ an inter@@ n@@ al air@@ line called kr@@ as@@ air , sp@@ elled k-@@ r-@@ a-@@ s .
take it out of this room .
you &apos;re eating at least 500 gra@@ ms per year .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s gone . &quot;
architecture for me has been an investig@@ ation of a multi@@ pli@@ city of forces that could come from literally any place .
my passion , and what i &apos;ve spent the last few years dedi@@ cated to resear@@ ching , is the collabor@@ ative behaviors and tru@@ st-@@ mechan@@ ics inher@@ ent in these systems .
and you &apos;re on one side or the other .
as you remember , cin@@ dy gal@@ lo@@ p said men don &apos;t know the difference between making love and doing por@@ n .
what &apos;s the effect of this ? so , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software .
and then we are talking also about materials , synthetic biology , for example .
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
and it &apos;s that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to mani@@ fest themselves .
it has a sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber in it so it , like , &quot; sh@@ h@@ h@@ h , &quot; makes this ne@@ at sound when you jump around on it . all right .
they get fit together , and then they com@@ pe@@ te .
so , thank you very much .
americans have an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented opportunity .
this is again showing all the different contribu@@ tions .
and most of all , it was not even in my college text@@ books .
i had to tell them every little detail of everything .
and i think ar@@ th@@ ur c. cl@@ ar@@ ke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet planet ocean .
my lea@@ ther adi@@ das base@@ ball ca@@ p mat@@ ches my fa@@ ke gu@@ c@@ c@@ i back@@ pack .
that &apos;s a tiny amount of material , but the way that ultimately expres@@ ses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species .
and networks make it harder for people to do that , because they drive attention to the things that the network values .
good morning .
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more cru@@ cial to our survival .
that &apos;s what happens at academic con@@ ferences .
sil@@ ks could be in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated into body and equipment ar@@ mor that would be more ligh@@ t@@ weight and flexi@@ ble than any ar@@ mor available today .
and what they do on that survey is they ask what &apos;s called a feeling ther@@ mom@@ eter r@@ ating .
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
the state is not a great par@@ ent .
and humans , by the way , are the only creatures cap@@ able of thinking about the future in this way , of proje@@ cting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fe@@ ars have in common with stor@@ y@@ telling .
most of the people who lived here either lived in co@@ ast@@ al villages , fis@@ hing , or were no@@ ma@@ ds who ro@@ amed around with the environment trying to find water .
but first , we have to ask another question , which is , &quot; what is color for ? &quot;
we &apos;re talking about popular tv .
and i think , as you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s reasons for optimism , because i believe that the best is yet to come .
i want to tell you about another dis@@ order .
by now , about 60 percent of the large companies it &apos;s been part of the pen@@ sion protection act .
i think we keep the que@@ en here , yes .
we set up a whole er .
like for instance , this is a google share of the ted conference .
hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton , west virginia .
it would also make us a more fair and just one , too .
this approach beat super@@ computers 50 percent of the time and tied 30 percent of the time .
she should not go into ban@@ king , for example , or work at a cash regi@@ ster .
someone once said that politics is , of course , &quot; sho@@ w@@ bi@@ z for ug@@ ly people . &quot;
and it certainly looks like it .
significant problems re@@ ma@@ ined .
then , in 19@@ 80 , there was a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e allen .
and this is about a little over four billion years ago .
and it goes over here ?
it wasn &apos;t the only passion i had .
and it was a dream . it was a wild dream to per@@ form in an orchestr@@ a , to per@@ form in the i@@ con@@ ic wal@@ t dis@@ ney con@@ c@@ ert hall in an orchestr@@ a condu@@ cted now by the famous gu@@ sta@@ v@@ o du@@ dam@@ el , but much more import@@ antly to me to be surrounded by musi@@ cians and ment@@ ors that became my new family , my new musical home .
they were doing something much simpler .
it seems very ambi@@ tious .
you needed to know that .
so again we per@@ si@@ sted , and fo@@ ster &apos;s bre@@ wing came to the party and gave us our first ever sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ship , and that was enough for me to qu@@ it my job , i did consu@@ l@@ ting on the side .
and it has imp@@ lications for syste@@ mic risk .
they all bit@@ ched about each other . i mean , quite g@@ ossi@@ p@@ y , those c@@ ables . okay , but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to gras@@ p , these are human beings just like us . they don &apos;t have special power@@ s .
so the develop@@ ers say , well this is great . okay , so if we have a conventional building , we have a fixed en@@ vel@@ op@@ e , maybe we can put in 14 un@@ its .
four atom@@ s of hydro@@ gen , the four points of the te@@ tra@@ he@@ dr@@ on , which means the little carbon at@@ om .
because liber@@ als re@@ je@@ ct three of these founda@@ tions .
the first group recei@@ ved secon@@ d-@@ line chemo@@ therapy , which is expected to double the life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy , versus no treatment at all .
if you &apos;re on val@@ en@@ ci@@ a street within those few blocks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m. , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ pac@@ ks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
unfortunately , not very long after@@ wards the company went out of business .
this p@@ lot shows two members of a pair .
even when building the im@@ peri@@ al pal@@ ace , they always leave one place un@@ finished .
and it was because of a rule , which , to me , is a very good rule : never be the bri@@ gh@@ test person in a room , and we weren &apos;t .
when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name , ant@@ on che@@ k@@ ho@@ v kept a not@@ ebook in which he not@@ ed down his ob@@ serva@@ tions of the world around him -- little details that other people seem to miss .
journalist : what about that , ad@@ mi@@ ral ?
so , in order to understand these issues , where do we find our phosph@@ or@@ us ?
it &apos;s getting pretty close to finished now .
and all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom .
these things that look like wh@@ is@@ kers that are sti@@ cking out from either side are the dynamic sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of the cell .
well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human sen@@ ses . but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a teles@@ cope , even one of pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day design , look out and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here .
such beautiful food , i enjo@@ yed it . it was so beautiful .
and we can play with this .
but the one thing that didn &apos;t happen was that there was never a serious and susta@@ ined de@@ cl@@ ine in the number of an@@ nu@@ al ex@@ ecu@@ tions in texas .
and i was just struck that this is out of place .
i started laugh@@ ing because it got to the point where , was i a writer , or was i a hom@@ eless woman ?
without iraq bal@@ an@@ cing iran , iran could now become a threat , some in israel argu@@ ed .
so finally , tex@@ ture is something .
so his gre@@ eting was not particularly war@@ m , but they did say , well , ok -- let &apos;s hear your questions on your survey .
so , don &apos;t worry about , don &apos;t stress about that stuff . we &apos;ve been doing this forever .
and you can imagine , and the thing about it is , that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gest@@ alt of what the images were about .
well , by and large people are enor@@ m@@ ously im@@ patient .
it stands for mu@@ tu@@ ally assu@@ red destruction .

i &apos;ve been interested in computer programs all my life , actually .
yeah , i know !
this kind of thinking dri@@ ves econom@@ ists crazy , and it should .
for community though , we start at the very beginning .
this is not the common man .
what a mat@@ ch for a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 final .
designer su@@ z@@ anne le@@ e shares her experiments in growing a kom@@ bu@@ cha@@ -@@ based material that can be used like fabri@@ c or vege@@ table lea@@ ther to make clo@@ thing . the process is fascinating , the results are beautiful and the potential is simply st@@ unning .
and i found one section am@@ ong@@ st all of these that actually res@@ em@@ bled the out@@ line of the united states of america , which you can see here .
but you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria , and you &apos;re consi@@ dered a par@@ asi@@ te yourself .
so these young men and women learned job@@ -@@ read@@ iness and life skills through be@@ e keeping and became produ@@ ctive citizens in the process .
i am an emo@@ tional creature .
and it filled this old ima@@ m , it filled him with great sa@@ dness .
her future husband , jeff , was working for can@@ on cameras , and met nat@@ ash@@ a at the olymp@@ ic village .
one study at an american university found that 6@@ 1 percent of college fres@@ hmen had da@@ ma@@ ged hearing as a result of head@@ phone ab@@ use .
not even worth it .
for one hour a day they &apos;re brought to these b@@ lea@@ k and bl@@ and exercise yards .
a few more weeks without rain , we would have never seen any of these .
this was the best way out .
kei@@ th chen : could your language affect your ability to save money ?
and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
so we can make money ?
but i didn &apos;t have to cut any of them really , because i just lin@@ ed up their ja@@ ws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next small@@ est one had 13 and the next small@@ est had 14 .
we know the sun will be sh@@ ining somewhere , and the wind will still be blo@@ wing in 20 or 30 years &apos; time .
but , you know , the government would make a plane ; they &apos;d say , go see if that one flies , would you ?
again , it &apos;s a mobile ph@@ one-@@ shap@@ ed box , and this one can change its shape .
i can &apos;t do this in front of all those people . my legs will come off .
every pres@@ entation needs this slide in it .

however , i did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of , you know , i think what the conference bro@@ ch@@ ure ref@@ ers to as &quot; moments that take your bre@@ ath away . &quot;
so , the fact that the gol@@ den rule is in some sense built in to us is not , by itself , going to bring us universal love .
ma@@ d@@ die &apos;s using temperature to ex@@ tend this phenomenon to a new scen@@ ari@@ o .
it felt like a revolution .
people have been asking this question for a long time .
so in the same way that i need time with this instrument , i need time with people in order to interpre@@ t them .
and so therefore , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , and who are partici@@ pat@@ ors of sound .
the eye@@ bro@@ ws are doing this , the eyes are de@@ focused , and the mouth is hanging open .
and the religions that should be making a major contribu@@ tion are instead seen as part of the problem .
so i thought , &quot; du@@ h , ro@@ bin , this is the difference between industrial production and pe@@ er production . &quot;
in this case , ch@@ impan@@ ze@@ es teaching each other how to cra@@ ck nu@@ ts with rocks .
i felt sh@@ y , i felt em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed .
we &apos;re hop@@ ing for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy s@@ ession with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 , so you keep coming back over and over again .
this idea is so per@@ v@@ asive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that i hear it literally everywhere i go .
they wanted it to end precisely on time .
i think we should say it all together .
day seven , they show the clas@@ sic sc@@ ars of small@@ po@@ x um@@ bili@@ cation .
a guy named ge@@ off co@@ ates , at cor@@ n@@ ell , said to himself , you know , plants do not see co2 as the biggest poison of our time .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
we actually do it all the time .
and the old fields , the suc@@ c@@ essi@@ onal fields that go .
i had this idea that i wanted people to recei@@ ve a kind of mysteri@@ ous love le@@ tter , like a found frag@@ ment in their ma@@ il@@ box .
this is an example of a spec@@ tro@@ gra@@ m .
and the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the que@@ en straight in the eye and said , &quot; please tell her i &apos;m the prime minister . &quot;
immediately : death swe@@ at .
his motion bl@@ ends right into the background -- the moving rock trick . so , we &apos;re learning lots new from the sh@@ allow water .
i write the code that makes the whole world run .
because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and st@@ oning adul@@ ter@@ ers , or -- here &apos;s another example .
and the example he used was coffee .
i &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
let me now turn to another project which involves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stances .
and she said , &quot; you know what ?
and when you find a l@@ one nu@@ t doing something great , have the gu@@ ts to be the first one to stand up and join in .
i &apos;m not interested in fil@@ ming the violence and the weap@@ ons .
and our p@@ c version became quite ma@@ ture .
fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ year-old afri@@ can@@ -@@ american construction wor@@ ker .
and if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back@@ -@@ flus@@ h .
if a card shark ga@@ thers the car@@ ds together , immediately when he -- before he de@@ als the card . now , so i think , number three , i have ar@@ ran@@ ged them in a full house .
when i was born , the world &apos;s population was 3@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
this is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now .
i &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far -- i &apos;m curious as to the op@@ ini@@ on in the ted audience .
that means that it is the numbers that control the form , not me .
so i hope you think of insects a little bit differ@@ ently next time , and as i say up here , please think before you sw@@ at .
what motiv@@ ated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific ad@@ vis@@ ers : &quot; what motiv@@ ates the poll@@ in@@ ators ? &quot;
i believe the government should do more , but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction .
so we went to the ordinary people that you saw .
we promise that the po@@ w@@ der river country will hen@@ ce@@ forth be closed to all whit@@ es .
two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
and i was thinking about quar@@ ks and gl@@ u@@ ons and heavy ion colli@@ sions , and i was only 14 years old .
the only thing i did was , i made it possible for them to turn those bla@@ des so you could sa@@ il this thing in the can@@ al , because i love sa@@ iling .
you understand that you can pre@@ p@@ are , but the amount of prepar@@ ation you can do is limited -- you can take some water , you can have a map , you can have a pack .
i think we &apos;re in like 17@@ 70 , somewhere around there .
most of them won &apos;t move at all , but some of them might make a tiny step .
and then ab@@ original women in africa would come and say , &quot; this is it ! &quot;
so what will follow is a stud@@ ent@@ -@@ made film about just that .
and conven@@ i@@ ently , one of my students was from ghana , and he remember@@ ed a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; ko@@ kon@@ te , &quot; which is a very sti@@ cky por@@ ri@@ dge made out of the cas@@ sa@@ va root .
it &apos;s an integr@@ ated system that has evolved despite all the plan@@ ning and so on .
now , any of those stat@@ s should convince each of us to get off our du@@ ff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedro@@ ck of manhattan , has really shap@@ ed our history and our character .
well , there are probably three reasons .
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy , but it happened .
growth is faster , and with proje@@ ction from im@@ f you can see where you expect them to be in 20@@ 14 .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to en@@ list in our own military forces .
other people , in the morning , got a sli@@ p of paper that said , &quot; by 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on somebody else . &quot;
and just by changing the fun@@ ctions , then i can decide what &apos;s going to be transparent and what &apos;s going to be visible .
because basically , he doesn &apos;t service them .
now as i was training in clinical medicine and he@@ mat@@ ology and on@@ c@@ ology and stem cell transplan@@ tation , what we had instead , cas@@ c@@ ading through the reg@@ ul@@ atory network at the f@@ da , were these sub@@ stances -- ar@@ sen@@ ic , th@@ ali@@ dom@@ ide and this chemical deri@@ va@@ tive of ni@@ tro@@ gen mu@@ star@@ d gas .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m just saying .
no amount of adver@@ tis@@ ing , no cle@@ ver marketing campa@@ ign , at any price , could have produced or created this much good@@ will .
add on pande@@ mic threat , you &apos;re in big trou@@ ble .
and we made a pol@@ l , the most fascinating pol@@ l i &apos;ve seen in my life .
and you can just imagine them .
and in one case , it origin@@ ated on another continent .
only three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
make sure you pay attention to them .
and researchers want to know why .
so we &apos;re seeing a rise of this avail@@ ability being driven by mobile device pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation , globally , across all social strat@@ a .
so i just recently dropped out of prin@@ c@@ et@@ on and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
it &apos;s forever fre@@ ely acc@@ essi@@ ble by biology letters .
thank you .
and we need some type of er@@ ror corre@@ ction red@@ und@@ an@@ cy to guar@@ an@@ tee that we have success@@ fully built what we want .
another colleague in the states tag@@ ged about 20 sharks off mas@@ sach@@ use@@ tts , and his tags didn &apos;t really work .
the tree was in part a cat@@ aly@@ st for the project .
the ne square in the middle -- actually ne , ch and q@@ re -- those are three different theor@@ ies of n@@ ash equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um , and others , tells you what the theory predi@@ cts , which is that they should mat@@ ch 50-@@ 50 , because if you play left too much , for example , i can explo@@ it that if i &apos;m the mis@@ mat@@ cher by then playing right .
we simply cannot store and main@@ tain or re@@ cycle all our stuff .
chromosome one , top left .
we can wear a sar@@ i or a hi@@ ja@@ b or pants or a b@@ ou@@ bo@@ u , and we can be party leaders and presi@@ d@@ ents and human rights lawyers .
i had no movement in my legs . i had ti@@ ght sto@@ ck@@ ings on to protect from blood cl@@ ots .
now , part of the reason for this is that we have an over@@ simpli@@ fied and increasingly out@@ mo@@ ded view of the biological basis of psychiat@@ ric dis@@ orders .
and what if there &apos;s no gps ?
and guess what , if it all fa@@ ils , if you can find a car that &apos;s still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . then you can custom@@ ize it .
so this particular student , james king , went around the beautiful english coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , pi@@ cked the best , best cow that he could see , and then put her in the mri machine .
rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us .
and they dis@@ si@@ pate this energy in the form of heat , and you know that effect .
and a day or two before it opened was gi@@ uli@@ an@@ i &apos;s far@@ e@@ well address , where he pro@@ posed the idea of all of ground zero being a memor@@ ial .
i &apos;ll put the blin@@ d@@ fold on .
i found out how many people had been put in ja@@ il , how many family members had been killed .
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun app that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fli@@ ck@@ r .
so if we add in a ch@@ impan@@ ze@@ e here , we will see more differences .
and if you look at this image -- here we are now in september the 13@@ th -- you &apos;re going to see a few cases light up .
and at that time , it became set in stone : the aqu@@ a@@ tic theory should be du@@ mp@@ ed with the u@@ fo@@ s and the ye@@ tis , as part of the lun@@ a@@ tic fr@@ inge of science .
i mean , we have critical infrastructure .
so you &apos;re you &apos;re really bor@@ ed in the sub@@ way , and you kind of st@@ are at something .
you can &apos;t do science without making it logi@@ cally consi@@ stent .
i can &apos;t go through all of them , but i &apos;ll give you an example .
rb : phili@@ ppe is quite er@@ ra@@ tic , so i think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .
they are hospital ships .
this inci@@ dent resul@@ ted in my invol@@ un@@ tary hosp@@ itali@@ zation .
all of them come from the cameras of american soldiers .
so i think we have to change metaph@@ ors .
and they can have the possibility of tran@@ scen@@ ding the circumstances under which they were born .
it &apos;s the particip@@ ation age , right ?
he said , &quot; i did not sell a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that na@@ z@@ i .
only , we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s a hom@@ eless shel@@ ter .
so you might ask at this point why she &apos;s calling you .
and for those of you who love the arts , aren &apos;t you gl@@ ad you invi@@ ted me here to bri@@ gh@@ ten your day ?
and my colleagues kind of think i &apos;m crazy , but i think it &apos;s very vi@@ able .
or another analo@@ g@@ y would be , a cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ar has been turned into a bu@@ tter@@ fly .
so all of our construction of reality is through these limited sen@@ ses .
it was trans@@ l@@ ated from japanese into english .
so , i looked a little further , and what i figured out was that he wasn &apos;t a nu@@ t@@ case .
and so what does that mean ?
and they were threat@@ ened by those black ships there , that had been in to@@ k@@ yo h@@ arb@@ or over the last year .
what would that look like for society ?
you too can realize your dreams , and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing .
but what &apos;s really amazing is that the cells , when we electri@@ cally stim@@ ulate them , like with a pac@@ e@@ ma@@ ker , that they beat so much more .
the community is looking . it still works .
&quot; the poor are un@@ edu@@ cated and cannot do much . &quot;
by exten@@ sion , we think to ourselves , &quot; why it &apos;s hot@@ ter in summer than in winter must be because we &apos;re closer to the sun . &quot;
and the first my@@ th to dis@@ pel is that africa is not a country .
that &apos;s the basis for the western model of repres@@ ent@@ ative government .
if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan , they &apos;re going to keep pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ating and not join .
and the super@@ massive black hol@@ es are thought to res@@ ide at the center of galaxies .
the pri@@ ces from the con@@ tra@@ ctors were between five to 7@@ 00,000 dollars .
this ability to interact ac@@ tively with the material and be told when you &apos;re right or wrong is really essenti@@ al to student learning .
now , the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil , and all hydro@@ carb@@ ons , turned out to be concent@@ rated sun@@ light . and if you think of bio@@ energy , bio@@ energy isn &apos;t eth@@ an@@ ol . bio@@ energy is taking the sun , concent@@ r@@ ating it in amo@@ e@@ b@@ as , concent@@ r@@ ating it in plants , and maybe that &apos;s why you get these ra@@ in@@ bo@@ ws .
the alternative is a strategy of engagement and princi@@ pl@@ ed dialo@@ gue .

so if i was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of ti@@ de deter@@ gent and swe@@ at was , you &apos;d probably think that &apos;s the eas@@ i@@ est question that you &apos;re going to be asked in e@@ din@@ burgh all week .
am@@ os winter : the cheap all-@@ ter@@ rain wheelchair
okay , back to b@@ m@@ w . what should they do ?
i don &apos;t believe we should .
she says , &quot; i left him with my sister at lei@@ th . &quot;
conditions were signific@@ antly col@@ der , but they were also less inten@@ se with respect to the ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let regi@@ me .
so now it &apos;s ho@@ ver@@ ing at about 40 meters , and it &apos;s constantly ad@@ ju@@ sting the ang@@ le , the pit@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w of the main engine , and main@@ tain@@ ing roll with coal gas th@@ ru@@ sters .
they became more rob@@ ust .
&quot; i already have , &quot; she told me .
half the number of parts are contain@@ ed in nan@@ o in compar@@ is@@ on to a typical pas@@ sen@@ ger car .
something very od@@ d , mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , never explained .
and we created , at the organization that i work for , the new economics foundation , something we call the happy planet index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
and as i sat con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating what to say , a woman approach@@ ed in a black sha@@ w@@ l and black ro@@ be .
experiments suggest that ligh@@ t@@ ning could be the next gps .
every time the di@@ atom@@ s repli@@ cate , they give the genetic information that says , &quot; here &apos;s how to build glass in the ocean that &apos;s perfectly nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
all right . this is pretty good ; this is pretty good .
they eat better ; they make love better ; they exercise better ; they work better ; they live better .
now , on the surface , the deal appe@@ ared stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward .
i found it in a book , &apos; film threat video guide : the 20 under@@ ground fil@@ ms you must see . &apos; &quot; oh , ok . so the next person@@ s says , &quot; clean it up . &quot;
have a good day . thank you .
this was the wrong answer .
i promised him that i would be the best girl , i will come back , anything they wanted after that , i will do it for them .
it &apos;s up around 55 to 60 degrees centi@@ grade .
my mom was in the audience .
i don &apos;t know , and i should .
and the building is very sc@@ ulp@@ tural as you walk around it .
he said , &quot; phili@@ ppe , you have been had .
the ac@@ id rain was fall@@ ing on the for@@ est@@ s .
anyone who has kids knows that if you off@@ er a kid a big co@@ ok@@ ie or a small co@@ ok@@ ie , which co@@ ok@@ ie are they going to take ? the big co@@ ok@@ ie .
it &apos;s like quality and quanti@@ ty of life in nations .
the chinese restaurant model spre@@ ads .
so , they will op@@ t for the it@@ em in the middle .
you can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagn@@ os@@ ed with auti@@ sm are actually suffering from hidden brain sei@@ zur@@ es .
we also ob@@ serve another thing , and that is , you fol@@ ks not only are solving fewer puzz@@ les , you &apos;re also putting less ju@@ ice into the task .
but we see the results of this technology , still .
two billion of them .
when i was a student , the mortality rate was about 9@@ 5 percent .
i use natural reed , because natural reed has a lot of ten@@ sion in it that i cannot fully control .
they &apos;d collected information with photos . they &apos;d man@@ ually build each building .
it &apos;s a company built in kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named patri@@ ck hen@@ fre@@ y and his three colleagues .
&quot; got something on my hair ? &quot; here we go . al@@ right .
what i had to dev@@ ise was a way of fo@@ ol@@ ing the eye into belie@@ ving that all these pan@@ els are cur@@ ved with the shell .
in two dimen@@ sions , if you make , like , a fabri@@ c out of them , they &apos;re 30 times stronger than k@@ ev@@ l@@ ar .
and you &apos;re familiar , of course , with anti@@ bodies as the hen@@ ch@@ men of the imm@@ une system .
and boy , did that make it easy for the money la@@ under@@ ers .
one , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman .
here &apos;s somebody , what they did as they went through cogni@@ tive training at ages seven and 11 .
but when you actually visu@@ alize it , all the connections that we &apos;re doing right now -- this is an image of the m@@ apping of the internet -- it doesn &apos;t look technological .
not a single at@@ om that is in your body today was there when that event took place . matter flows from place to place and moment@@ arily comes together to be you .
i think they just have one idea in their mind , which is , where you live in the world should not deter@@ mine whether you live in the world .
it &apos;s called dark matter .
and the way to it , for me , was through arti@@ stic means .
every school was a big top cir@@ cus tent , and the pe@@ cking order went from ac@@ ro@@ bat@@ s to li@@ on tam@@ ers , from clo@@ wns to car@@ ni@@ es , all of these miles ahead of who we were .
now if perception is gro@@ unded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
i took one look at the road map of life , and i ran off down the street mar@@ ked &quot; ge@@ ek &quot; as fast as my ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , asth@@ matic little legs would carry me .
or is this just right for this place ?
but it was too st@@ on@@ ey and full of c@@ actu@@ s on top .
these are the cars .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in congress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and if women fa@@ iled to birth male children , they were basically treated like dom@@ esti@@ c ser@@ van@@ ts .
which was three minutes longer than i had prepar@@ ed .
more animals , if they start doing search@@ es as well .
so you can see that both of these series -- the black line is exp@@ ort value , the red line is new hiv infe@@ ctions -- you can see they &apos;re both increasing .
look at the state of preser@@ vation -- still the ad mark of a car@@ p@@ enter . look at the state of those arti@@ facts .
i &apos;m not going to play my own com@@ position today because , although i did finish it , it &apos;s way too long .
and let &apos;s start at the high level , on the ma@@ cro@@ -@@ factors .
and it turns out they almost did .
now i assu@@ me that we remember dinosau@@ rs .
think about how we sele@@ ct our jud@@ ges in this country .
i ask people sometimes , and they say , &quot; i like the aqu@@ a@@ tic theory !
but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neu@@ tra@@ l .
and ma@@ sters and john@@ son looked to see if the se@@ men was being su@@ cked up .
it &apos;s a brilliant tex@@ tile in use .
not only that -- we always have this va@@ gue notion that something &apos;s expected of us .
and this is what it is .
and so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system .
it &apos;s like the earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
so i &apos;m really a basic scientist , not a clin@@ i@@ cian , but in the last year and a half i &apos;ve started to switch over , to use what we &apos;ve been learning about these patterns of activity to develop pros@@ the@@ tic devices , and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
i became a photographer , ab@@ and@@ oned everything and became a photographer , and i started to do the photograph@@ y that was important for me .
and , fund@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily through s@@ lo@@ an foundation and others , we were able to actually go in , in our project -- we &apos;re one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tag@@ ging large numbers of pre@@ dat@@ ors , not just tun@@ as .
and it was during this time that there was increas@@ ed cal@@ ci@@ um and ir@@ on and si@@ lic@@ on in the environment , and organis@@ ms learned how to make hard materials .
i think , myself , that life is a natural out@@ growth of the increasing comple@@ xi@@ fication of matter over time .
and where , at the nation state level that power is held to accoun@@ t@@ ability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not .
of course that means that architecture is political .
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sam@@ pl@@ ed d@@ ust .
there &apos;s no point in just killing the od@@ d mos@@ qui@@ to here and there .
what if a small part of that next healthcare work@@ force were the 11 million college students in this country ?
more pu@@ ffs , or more inten@@ se pu@@ ffs , make the state last for a longer period of time .
in a study fund@@ ed by over 25 million tax@@ pa@@ yer dollars , digital mammo@@ graphy was found to be no better over all than traditional mammo@@ graphy , and in fact , it was worse in older women .
they moved me from inten@@ sive care to ac@@ ute spin@@ al .
and i looked at it , and i was like , this is really cool .
chr@@ ist , the chinese even invented golf .
so when i go in the room , i close the door .
they required sc@@ or@@ es of highly sk@@ ill@@ ed we@@ aver@@ s working over exten@@ ded peri@@ ods of time with very expensive materials -- the wo@@ ols , the sil@@ ks , even gold and sil@@ ver thre@@ ad .
well , remember that &apos;s not even an order of ma@@ gni@@ tude , but that &apos;s a different story .
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work so well anymore either .
i used the need@@ le which has got a s@@ light bla@@ de on the end .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing at the red@@ wood neuroscience institute .
and if you have to travel some distance far@@ ther than you can do under your own power , there &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble vehicles , and if you can &apos;t afford one of those , there &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble public transpor@@ tation .
those two things are the huge shif@@ ts of power in our century .
and deut@@ sche bank even said world oil use could pe@@ ak around 20@@ 16 .
an interesting feature of lots of modern smar@@ t@@ phones is that when you take a photo , it em@@ be@@ ds gps data about where that photo was taken .
and it has the it@@ ur@@ i forest itself -- about 1,@@ 300 species of plants , so far known .
what i would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going , we continue that tra@@ je@@ ctory , and we say &quot; well what &apos;s going to become more energ@@ y-@@ den@@ se , that &apos;s where it &apos;s going . &quot; and so what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say , &quot; what are the general trends in evolutionary life ? &quot;
and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
but instead i saw this .
but , you know , we &apos;ve just come from this discus@@ sion of what a bird might be .

so they could do that on their own .
intervie@@ wer : you didn &apos;t expect . engineer : exactly .
now , of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand pian@@ o with a million keys .
im : you know what ? stop laugh@@ ing . it &apos;s not funny .
now , we &apos;ve seen a lot of examples of people who are pur@@ su@@ ing that sort of vision in science , but i think it &apos;s also true in the arts , it &apos;s true in politics , it &apos;s even true in personal en@@ dea@@ vors .
it would achieve some national pri@@ de , but not go ahead and build a weap@@ on .
we sing .
so if you were thinking of buying an i@@ pad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
we have this molecule , but it &apos;s not a p@@ ill yet .
after the race , he tos@@ sed his we@@ t , clou@@ d-@@ white hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , ander@@ son , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
two years ago , recor@@ ding artist chris brown rele@@ ased the offi@@ cial video of his single &quot; forever . &quot;
we could go back to bab@@ b@@ age &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
now , i &apos;ve just la@@ id out the picture for you , but i still haven &apos;t explained to you why this is happening .
let me just give you a few examples . so here &apos;s a baby .
teacher tur@@ no@@ ver is eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
and what i want to show you is -- actually this is one of the components of it that we &apos;ve just recently been testing -- which is a solar chim@@ ney -- we have got 17 of them now put around new york at the moment -- that passi@@ v@@ ely dra@@ ws air up .
i loved that i could hi@@ de within this sha@@ dow my own pain@@ ted version , and it would be almost invisible until the light changed , and all of a sudden my sha@@ dow would be brought to the light .
so , we &apos;re ad@@ ding a city the size of se@@ attle every seven days , and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or i live in .
mark pa@@ gel : how language transformed humanity
and we now have seen tam@@ i@@ flu@@ -@@ resist@@ ant stra@@ ins in both viet@@ na@@ m in person@@ -@@ to-@@ person trans@@ mission , and in egyp@@ t in person@@ -@@ to-@@ person trans@@ mission .
and so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently i particip@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 event that i could take part in and gave news con@@ ferences , interviews , talking and using my plat@@ form as a musi@@ cian , with my commit@@ ment to mand@@ ela -- out of respect for the tremendous , unbelie@@ vable work that he had done .
as l@@ ord black@@ stone descri@@ bed it , land is protected by tr@@ es@@ pass law , for most of the history of tr@@ es@@ pass law , by pres@@ um@@ ing it prote@@ cts the land all the way down below and to an in@@ defin@@ ite ex@@ tent up@@ ward .
because of the rush of human knowledge , because of the digital revolution , i have a voice , and i do not need to scre@@ am .
if you add it all up what do you get ?
there &apos;s no waste .
in clas@@ si@@ cal physics , there is always some fri@@ ction , some energy loss .
they decided in 1960 , &quot; that bel@@ on@@ gs with the u@@ fo@@ s and the ye@@ tis . &quot;
but i didn &apos;t quite know all that much about movement or film .
not only that , but as i move the object around , it &apos;s going to track it and over@@ lay that content se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
and this fre@@ ak@@ ed the media businesses out -- it fre@@ ak@@ ed them out every time .
we frame it as a challenge of hope , and that is worth creation .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ eight percent of our fa@@ thers are al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic@@ s .
i don &apos;t have a good answer .
so , do we need this ?
this is the way theor@@ ies of uni@@ fication work .
only if you control and reg@@ ulate it , you will get that aer@@ o@@ dynamic effi@@ ci@@ ency .
sar@@ ah kam@@ in@@ sky tells the extraordinary story of her father ad@@ ol@@ f@@ o and his activity during world war ii -- using his in@@ genu@@ ity and talent for for@@ gery to save lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you ask this guy , what -- &quot; all that gli@@ t@@ ters is not gold , &quot; the patient says , &quot; well , if it &apos;s metal@@ lic and sh@@ iny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
library of congress holds 18 million vol@@ umes .
well , a different approach has been to look at morph@@ ology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again , largely sk@@ ull shape .
if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly ac@@ knowledge far more , trib@@ al di@@ visions and so forth .
moral ambigu@@ ity takes off .
she was thro@@ wn in prison in ti@@ be@@ t for two years for putting up a little tiny plac@@ ard prote@@ sting the occup@@ ation of her country .
now these are stories from basic science .
that doesn &apos;t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .
and using this system , we can test the pot@@ ency of cancer drugs .
this is what &apos;s called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side , on the right , are different genes .
and there are two key things it &apos;s got to do .
it &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an enti@@ ty such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
and in the middle of that war , i was 14 years old .
any culture can get the work eth@@ ic if the institutions are there to create the in@@ cen@@ tive to work .
i &apos;m working with a third party company to make an app .
so , you know , we now can learn the history of organis@@ ms .
so i gra@@ b the do@@ ve , and for the second time i send her in the air .
and what you have here is , when you actually turn on the gate , you get an increase in the amount of current , and you get a ste@@ ady flow of current .
look at the nu@@ cle@@ i . the nu@@ cle@@ i in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
building sophisticated edu@@ ca@@ tional tools out of cheap parts , johnny le@@ e demo@@ s his cool wi@@ i remote hac@@ ks , which turn the $ 40 video game controller into a digital whit@@ e@@ board , a touch@@ screen and a head@@ -@@ moun@@ ted 3-@@ d vie@@ wer .
rule number three : have a plan .
and by remember@@ ing to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
in the same way , this is like brain science and these memor@@ ies are going to be a very fundamental technology , and it &apos;s going to lead to very unbelie@@ vable changes in the next 100 years .
and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what , to me , is really his greatest building which is a building in d@@ ha@@ ka , banglades@@ h .
and when the molecule h@@ its a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neigh@@ b@@ ors there are , they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchron@@ y .
things are bad enough as they are . &quot;
it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even &#91; though &#93; our eight signals would say , &quot; stop , enough .
such a random jum@@ ble of letters is said to have a very high entrop@@ y .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
so for example , in the 11@@ th century , people li@@ ked pieces that ended like this .
so many of us today have the sen@@ sation that time &apos;s ar@@ row is poin@@ ting everywhere and no@@ where at once .
i told a bunch of my engineers , &quot; look we &apos;re going to walk into walter reed , and you &apos;re going to see people , lots of them , missing major body parts .
so according to in@@ dy@@ k , and these are his words , the ir@@ ani@@ ans had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to de@@ fe@@ at our policy of contain@@ ment .
so i think lo@@ cally and i act lo@@ cally .
so there &apos;s a certain amount of super@@ fi@@ ci@@ ality in that data .
and protect another million jobs now at risk , main@@ ly in auto@@ -@@ making .
and that &apos;s exponenti@@ al growth through five different paradig@@ ms .
are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off , as a fam@@ ine ?
and i was constantly reading the new york times , and stun@@ ned by the statistics , the numbers .
the first limit@@ ation is the oxygen -- oxygen to@@ xic@@ ity .
the very first thing i want to do is start my talk with a graph .
in the af@@ gh@@ an section in london responsible for go@@ ver@@ ning af@@ gh@@ an policy on the ground , i was told last year that there was not a single staf@@ f me@@ mber of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a po@@ sting in afghanistan .
and you could basically do this a billion times .
you see , hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bir@@ ds are not hy@@ person@@ ic , but they are man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able .
more than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .
now we have to reach beyond the co@@ zy circle of our western friends .
and so what we &apos;re looking for is that gene .
you will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young -- a huge amount of information .
what that means is that each reading can be auto@@ matically trans@@ mit@@ ted to ser@@ vers to be m@@ apped in real time .
okay . a@@ wes@@ ome .
but what we don &apos;t often see is that there &apos;s always a third side , and the third side of the conflict is us , it &apos;s the surrounding community , it &apos;s the friends , the al@@ lies , the family members , the neigh@@ b@@ ors .
technology then meant we had to hi@@ re a vie@@ wing cin@@ em@@ a , find and pay for the print and the proje@@ c@@ tion@@ ist .
it &apos;s a tiny , tiny thing .
so i might be doing something du@@ mb , just like he was doing at the time .
he had to learn from it . he had to learn to hear the music in language .
we synchron@@ ize the machines , set them into these sta@@ ged social interactions , and we e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on both of the inter@@ acting brains . so for the first time , we don &apos;t have to look at just aver@@ ages over single individuals , or have individuals playing computers , or try to make in@@ ferences that way . we can study individual dy@@ ads .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , f@@ using those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hat@@ ches out with a three-@@ fing@@ ered hand , like the arch@@ a@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x .
it &apos;s seen as hypo@@ cris@@ y .
he was 20@@ -@@ some years older than anybody else in the s@@ ample .
you tested three , and found that four worked better ?
they also understand that an er@@ otic space isn &apos;t about , you begin to stro@@ ke the other .
so what if we could just take these chan@@ nel@@ rho@@ dop@@ sins and other mole@@ cul@@ es and inst@@ all them on some of these other sp@@ are cells and conver@@ t them into little cameras .
what you &apos;re actually measuring is sp@@ elled out in clean language .
but it isn &apos;t .
now what i &apos;m also interested in is : is it possible to separate in@@ trin@@ sic and ex@@ trin@@ sic beauty ?
president ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , he said , &quot; believe you can , and you are hal@@ f@@ way there . &quot;
and what about sleep ?
certainly we &apos;ve seen in recent years a lot of change in that reg@@ ard , and people are starting to wake up about that .
thank you very much , i appreciate it .
and the irs has introduced the program .
finally , after about 10 years of ali@@ en@@ ating friends and str@@ an@@ gers ali@@ ke , i finally got it , a new personal truth all my own , that if i was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was ga@@ ining , i &apos;d better find a different way of going about it .
and also , one year , the g@@ 3 bon@@ di blue thing -- that cad@@ dy would come out , like , dangerous , like , &quot; wh@@ ack , &quot; like that .
and i also think that thinking about process@@ ed fo@@ ods in a new way , where we actually price the negative ex@@ tern@@ alities like pet@@ ro@@ chemicals and like ferti@@ li@@ zer r@@ un@@ off into the price of a ba@@ g of chips .
kan@@ o , sal@@ ag@@ a -- they were all there .
well , let me just say , that was a graphic . i just want to show this picture .
we want to learn about animals . we want ... &quot; you know , it goes on and on , and this is very hope@@ ful for me .
we actually flo@@ ated an apple in ho@@ mage to sir is@@ aa@@ c newton because professor haw@@ king holds the same chair at cambridge that is@@ aa@@ c newton did .
and actually 700 and change million cars today e@@ mit 2@@ .@@ 8 billion tons of co2 .
i &apos;m going to show you pictures of bel@@ ug@@ a whales , bo@@ whe@@ ad whales , and nar@@ wh@@ als , and pol@@ ar be@@ ars , and le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other i &apos;ve ever made .
and they learn soon enough , even before they can u@@ tter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want .
as you see , tem@@ ples and go@@ ds play a big role in all ancient civili@@ zations .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she plan@@ ned would happen once she went there , you know .
start differ@@ enti@@ ating into effe@@ ctor and memory cells .
so now we know that tor@@ osau@@ rus is actually a grow@@ nu@@ p tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops .
their use@@ ful@@ ness vari@@ es and contribu@@ tes to vari@@ ation in the society &apos;s treatment of the el@@ der@@ ly .
there is no engine . there &apos;s a solar pan@@ el on the back , and there are bat@@ teri@@ es in the whe@@ els .
nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the ab@@ alone shell , the survival of a species didn &apos;t depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter .
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
and i started to kill my blo@@ g slowly .
am i really saying that there can be nothing learned , yes from the posi@@ tives in asia and india , but also the nega@@ tives ?
&quot; don &apos;t use big words . &quot;
this was a not@@ able moment , because this was the first time a world lea@@ der in almost 200 years had sug@@ gest@@ ed that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble of happiness -- that lea@@ der 200 years ago , thomas je@@ ff@@ er@@ son with the de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of in@@ dependence -- 200 years later , this king was sug@@ gest@@ ing that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble of happiness is something that we should measure , and it &apos;s something we should actually value as government offi@@ ci@@ als .
and that content is all off the board now .
we had an animal running on a tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ill at du@@ ke university on the east co@@ ast of the united states , producing the brain@@ stor@@ ms necessary to move .
but what happens is , of course , it mu@@ tat@@ es over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather in@@ si@@ di@@ ous .
but it &apos;s important to note that all of this re@@ tro@@ fit@@ ting is not oc@@ curr@@ ing -- just bu@@ ll@@ do@@ z@@ ers are coming and just p@@ lo@@ wing down the whole city .
so in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when i began in 1960 .
but other examples are traffic j@@ ams , stock market , society and dis@@ aster recovery , terrorism and insur@@ gency .
and n@@ and@@ 2@@ te@@ tr@@ is became one of the first massive , open , online cour@@ ses , although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called mo@@ oc@@ s .
now , i happen to have followed one of my in@@ mates , one of my friends , from his sick bed till death , and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all .
he says , &quot; the initi@@ al organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience .
professor , if you had to guess either way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the mil@@ ky way , as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher ?
why don &apos;t we know some of these things a little bit better ?
i just kind of learned through doing .
you treat the o@@ bes@@ ity .
and always ap@@ ologi@@ ze when you &apos;ve done something wrong , but don &apos;t you ever ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the way your eyes ref@@ use to stop sh@@ ining .
so a very comp@@ elling theory that &apos;s really main@@ stream physics .
and it turns out that it &apos;s tri@@ bes -- not money , not factor@@ ies -- that can change our world , that can change politics , that can al@@ ign large numbers of people .
but in survi@@ ving this last year , i was re@@ min@@ ded of a car@@ din@@ al rule -- not a research rule , but a moral imper@@ ative from my up@@ bringing -- you &apos;ve got to dance with the one who br@@ ung ya .
and he introduced me to the work of a man named ter@@ ry laugh@@ lin who is the fo@@ under of total immer@@ sion swimming .
they must navi@@ gate markets da@@ ily , making micro@@ -@@ decisions , do@@ zens and do@@ zens , to move their way through society , and yet if a single cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c health problem imp@@ acts their family , they could be put back into poverty , sometimes for generations .
the second set of ideas i call &quot; ideas in progress . &quot;
a little se@@ ed wei@@ gh@@ s a lot and , basically , all this stuff , 99 percent of this stuff , came out of the air .
so i just want to get your first impres@@ sions when you see that , when you see the diam@@ ond sh@@ red@@ dies box there .
so let me share with you our values .
if this was a war with two dis@@ par@@ ate sides , i , by de@@ fau@@ lt , fell on team ga@@ y , because i certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
that &apos;s not sustainable either .
but there were also re@@ vel@@ ations .
these four dri@@ vers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defin@@ ed by hyper@@ -@@ consumption , towards the 21st century , defin@@ ed by collabor@@ ative consumption .
&quot; practical wisdom , &quot; ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le told us , &quot; is the combination of moral will and moral skill . &quot;
the im@@ print of a man who had been bur@@ ned inside his own home .
film@@ ma@@ ker david hoff@@ man shares foot@@ age from his fe@@ at@@ u@@ re-@@ leng@@ th docum@@ ent@@ ary sputnik man@@ ia , which shows how the so@@ vi@@ et union &apos;s la@@ unch of sputnik in 19@@ 5@@ 7 led to both the space race and the arms race -- and j@@ ump@@ -@@ started science and math education around the world .
so what happened is that the fl@@ ame travel@@ ed through the glass v@@ es@@ sel from top to bottom , burning the mix of the air mole@@ cul@@ es and the al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
they have a national en@@ cryp@@ ted radio communications system .
he &apos;s going to put something in its hand , he &apos;s going to bring it over here , press a butt@@ on and let go of that thing in the hand .
and experience is not just a kind of enter@@ tain@@ ment in a non-@@ cas@@ ual way .
i recom@@ mend at least five minutes a day , but there is no maximum d@@ ose .
so you go to the contain@@ er store and spend an enormous amount of money , and then you start this crazy sor@@ ting process that never -- it &apos;s just nu@@ ts .
so this is what filled our days .
i &apos;ll now pro@@ ce@@ ed quickly , and before else , to a subject that is both a vital as@@ set and a potential bar@@ rier to a scientific career .
ray ander@@ son : the business logic of sustain@@ ability
in 2008 , cycl@@ one nar@@ g@@ is de@@ va@@ st@@ ated my@@ an@@ mar .
i don &apos;t think you understand . i think your phone lines are un@@ man@@ ned .
the self : you are self-@@ aware .
so let &apos;s look at some examples . this is ter@@ ry .
that &apos;s free@@ man , a long time ago , and that was me .
you have to sc@@ roll , like , seven scre@@ en@@ s-@@ full to get to it .
how do we begin to wea@@ ve these t@@ ap@@ est@@ ries together ?
in contr@@ ast , of course , we have the hi@@ pp@@ o generation .
and the other gener@@ alization that i want to mention is that it &apos;s particularly hard for a society to make quot@@ e-@@ un@@ quote good decisions when there is a conflict invol@@ ving stron@@ g@@ ly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . for example , the green@@ land nor@@ se , in this difficult environment , were held together for four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half centuries by their shared commit@@ ment to religion , and by their strong social co@@ h@@ es@@ ion . but those two things -- commit@@ ment to religion and strong social co@@ h@@ es@@ ion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the in@@ u@@ it . or today -- australi@@ a .
inci@@ dent@@ ally , we see just one oc@@ ta@@ ve .
everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
but even more striking than the fer@@ o@@ cious power e@@ man@@ ating from that well was the re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness with which that power was un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed -- the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the l@@ ack of plan@@ ning that charac@@ teri@@ zed the operation from dri@@ ll@@ ing to cle@@ an-@@ up .
and let me go back to that image of the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
i went to five countries around the world .
what we fear is the jud@@ gment and ridi@@ cule of others . and it exists .
so am@@ anda , you can see , has really good control .
the trou@@ ble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do .
and this introdu@@ ces a very important eth@@ ical point , and i think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up .
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
those guys are measuring influence , not behaviors that indi@@ cate our tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
so what &apos;s happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they &apos;re younger .
and in the developing world overall , that figure is 40 to 50 percent .
so , the program that we &apos;re involved in is something which we call diagno@@ stics for all , or zero-@@ cost diagno@@ stics .
two groups of mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ de@@ en started fighting .
it works really , really well .
and as an experiment , because i da@@ un@@ t@@ ingly create a task for myself of re@@ creating a satur@@ n v la@@ unch for this particular movie , because i put it out there , i felt a little nervous about it , so i need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a proje@@ ction room and play this stock foot@@ age , and when i played this stock foot@@ age , i simply wanted to find out what people remember@@ ed , what was memor@@ able about it ?
and here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
so the countries that had women repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives were canada , ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an , phili@@ pp@@ ines , tr@@ ini@@ dad to@@ b@@ ago , ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a , lich@@ ten@@ stein and me .
so , here &apos;s how it stac@@ ks up against an entire neuron .
a gest@@ ure of &quot; na@@ ma@@ ste ! &quot; , maybe , to respect someone , or maybe -- in india i don &apos;t need to teach a kid that this means &quot; four runs &quot; in cri@@ cket .
right now , about a third of that carbon di@@ oxide is dis@@ solving straight into the sea , right ?
there are so many other people sharing their stories .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 3@@ 50 , 400 uses .
what good is it to build a zero-@@ carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor producing this architec@@ tural gem is un@@ eth@@ ical at best ?
so how could the secret of ever@@ la@@ sting you@@ th actually lie within the bat genome ? does anybody want to ha@@ z@@ ard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
now the first step in solving any problem is ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ ging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
maybe those reasons , or depen@@ ding on where you are , ca@@ da@@ vers may not be easily available .
thank you very much once again .
and the people who &apos;d created it came back : the project mana@@ gers , the company cha@@ ir@@ men then .
it was a very tra@@ gic time . it was a very difficult time .
in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techni@@ qu@@ es to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
some of these have already been touched upon by other speak@@ ers , which is en@@ coura@@ ging .
and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years , but within this pres@@ identi@@ al term because if we don &apos;t , we will lose our economy , right after we &apos;d lost our morality .
but a few years earlier , while still at school , he &apos;d actually cra@@ cked one of the big mathema@@ tical problems at the time .
and there &apos;s about 130 million people in mi@@ gra@@ tion trying to get into urban centers at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expe@@ cting another 400 to 500 million people to mi@@ gra@@ te into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers .
what are the risk factors ?
women have two cop@@ ies of that big x chromosome ; men have the x and , of course , that small copy of the y .
i said , &quot; well , where would you build this thing ? &quot;
if you buy our car it &apos;s about 20@@ ,000 euro@@ s .
con@@ scienti@@ ousness and sym@@ path@@ y .
super@@ -@@ logi@@ cal , you would think .
and what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provi@@ des a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
that is your best case out@@ come when you get su@@ ed by a patent tro@@ ll .
how would we know it ?
secon@@ dly , get in touch with making some sound -- create sound .
can we create the kind of patterns that we &apos;re seeing in places like iraq ?
we gar@@ ner@@ ed much support along the way .
and finally , we take this multi@@ la@@ y@@ ered skin and through a shor@@ ter and much less chemical tan@@ ning process , we create lea@@ ther .
i think this is an amazing development .
that &apos;s how i solved it in my head . it was a white paper i hand@@ ed out to governments .
but we have no idea what we &apos;re going find when we go out there with our technology .
since september the 11@@ th , when my work on islam suddenly prop@@ elled me into public life , in a way that i &apos;d never imag@@ ined , i &apos;ve been able to sort of go all over the world , and finding , everywhere i go , a ye@@ ar@@ ning for change .
my talk today is about self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence .
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot;
the rest of it is the bed@@ side con@@ sol@@ e ; just for re@@ ference , this is a sleep tra@@ cking system from just a few years ago -- i mean , really until now .
in 1997 , a conven@@ tion , under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the oec@@ d , which ob@@ li@@ ged everybody to change their laws and cri@@ min@@ alize foreign bri@@ ber@@ y .
there &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own ment@@ ality about play .
it &apos;s a film about may@@ a gre@@ tel , a famous cer@@ am@@ ic@@ ist , and a teacher at cran@@ bro@@ ok .
why do people succe@@ ed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? n@@ either . analy@@ st richard st. john con@@ den@@ ses years of interviews into an un@@ miss@@ able 3-@@ minute sli@@ des@@ how on the real secre@@ ts of success .
it becomes a desire , a need , an ar@@ mor .
this guy over here of course is me .
you can sub@@ scri@@ be to up@@ dat@@ es from him . you can talk to him .
nine out of 10 japanese students say that it depends on my own investment , on my own effort , and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them .
and as we thought about it more , we realized that it let you f@@ ill in all the details about the experience , just as if you saw it on tv . so , for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel mag@@ net and work with ro@@ man and his team at the dire@@ ctors bu@@ re@@ au to create a commercial for a product from the future .
&quot; it &apos;s funny , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; you can m@@ ing@@ le with the opposite sex at the hol@@ y ka@@ ab@@ a , but not at the bur@@ ger king . &quot;
we have a lot to learn .
we are grat@@ eful , but we know that we can take char@@ ge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to reform .
turn it on ; turn it off .
&quot; tell your publi@@ sh@@ er not to list your hom@@ et@@ own in your author bi@@ o . &quot;
the fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; what is food ? &quot;
hon@@ e@@ ybe@@ es are not native to america ; they were introduced with the colon@@ i@@ ali@@ sts .
very wise man , because he knew i would , i felt like i was making the decision on my own , and he knew i wouldn &apos;t choose st. john &apos;s , so i went to hol@@ y name high school , which was a t@@ ough transition because , like i said , i didn &apos;t play spor@@ ts , and it was very focused on spor@@ ts , but i took sol@@ ace in mr. shil@@ ale &apos;s art room .
and i said , &quot; but what &apos;s the water part ? &quot;
but i &apos;m going to go over the technological , social and sort of where are we as a whole , trying to get to that particular vision .
we were very lucky to have two of our part@@ ners partici@@ pate in this : the histor@@ ic scot@@ land , and the glas@@ go@@ w school of art .
and what we &apos;ve been able to do is get into libr@@ aries .
so , it &apos;s a very difficult thing to get people to exp@@ and the moral imagination to a place it doesn &apos;t naturally go .
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can &apos;t see them without a micros@@ cope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick .
i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
what we want to look at is &quot; africa : the next ch@@ ap@@ ter , &quot; and that &apos;s this : a healthy , sm@@ iling , beautiful african .
there are more people being rap@@ ed . there are more wars .
so what we found was , when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was low , people were more likely to take re@@ ven@@ ge when they &apos;re treated un@@ fair@@ ly .
he was a 12@@ -year-old boy who had stol@@ en a bicycle .
the other thing is that we &apos;ve got much lower costs .
and there we worked with leading ce@@ os on african issues , and african companies on tur@@ n@@ aro@@ unds , making the companies not just the best in africa but the best globally .
good morning everybody .
and when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
the question , though , is not &quot; why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
v@@ s ra@@ mach@@ and@@ ran : 3 clu@@ es to understanding your brain
now you &apos;d think that &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; would introdu@@ ce a measure of americ@@ ani@@ zation .
and as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century , i have be@@ gun that looking through artists , through art@@ works , and imag@@ ining what they can tell us about the future , what they tell us about our future , and what they create in their sense of off@@ ering us this great possibility of watching that continent emer@@ ge as part of our bigger dialo@@ gue .
and that was true until i got to college .
more and more , it &apos;s possible for gr@@ ass@@ roots hat@@ red ab@@ road to mani@@ fest itself in the form of organi@@ zed violence on american soil .
i &apos;m only ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating a little bit . it &apos;s a bro@@ ad patent .
and i think just the opposite is true .
i &apos;m showing two artists here , gl@@ en@@ n li@@ g@@ on and caro@@ l walker , two of many who really form for me the essenti@@ al questions that i wanted to bring as a cur@@ ator to the world .
when the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it lo@@ cks down into that re@@ cep@@ tor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .
there &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in africa that has the same level as swe@@ den and united states .
so this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer peter sa@@ vil@@ le , went to fashion designer alexander mc@@ que@@ en , and photographer ni@@ ck k@@ night , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
now , if i take out my public health ner@@ d glas@@ ses here and look at these data , it seems like a no@@ -@@ brain@@ er , doesn &apos;t it ?
&quot; there &apos;s one thing more -- there &apos;s just one more thing you better understand .
and fran@@ k@@ ly , although i keep getting asked this , it never occur@@ red to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances .
that &apos;s been do@@ g@@ ging me for the last 12 years was cre@@ di@@ ted certainly to this cha@@ p , the ra@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ looking gent@@ le@@ man standing at the back , second from the left , george le@@ e m@@ all@@ ory . many of you will know his name .
i know some of you in the crow@@ d are thinking , well , carbon di@@ oxide is hor@@ ri@@ ble , it &apos;s a greenhouse gas .
there &apos;s a way to kill two bir@@ ds with one stone .
and there are two bars . one bar indi@@ c@@ ates that the test is working , and if the second bar shows up , you &apos;re pre@@ gn@@ ant .
so if i gave you that picture , i don &apos;t want to go too long on that .
the fluid wick@@ s its way into those ch@@ am@@ bers at the top .
&quot; you mean god didn &apos;t want my bre@@ ad ? &quot;
and so , as a child , i saw ja@@ m disappear from the break@@ fast table , then mar@@ gar@@ ine disappeared , then bre@@ ad became too expensive , then milk became ration@@ ed .
and he had s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed in two comics , two com@@ ic books -- &quot; spider@@ man &quot; and &quot; x-@@ men . &quot;
at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occas@@ ion and to become their own heroes .
and it might just be coming to a neigh@@ bor@@ hood near you soon .
they were the sie@@ men@@ ses of this world , coming from fr@@ ance , from the u@@ k , from japan , from canada , from germany , and they were syste@@ matically driven by syste@@ matic , lar@@ ge-@@ scale corruption .
thank you .
so what happens when you put these things together ?
it was very difficult actually , putting these people in the machine , because they were in such bad shape .
but that day in the cotton field out there pi@@ cking , when those people started sing@@ ing , i realized i was in the very heart of real music , and that &apos;s where i &apos;ve wanted to be ever since .
that is my wish . thank you .
so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather play@@ ful attempt to try to an@@ no@@ y fruit flies might actually have some relev@@ ance to a human psychiat@@ ric dis@@ order .
like it is in the movie .
and i was flo@@ or@@ ed , and i was broken , and i was an@@ gry .
so i ch@@ ose fur@@ ni@@ ture .
and that &apos;s when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sket@@ ches .
we &apos;re already an urban planet ; that &apos;s especially true in the developed world .
i can &apos;t tell you how reas@@ su@@ red i was by the very last sentence in that gl@@ ori@@ ous pres@@ entation by de@@ an kamen a few days ago .
this is how it &apos;s shifting .
and as i was trying to show you , as far as i &apos;m concer@@ ned , aid does da@@ ma@@ ges because it re@@ moves the government from its citizens .
and i &apos;d like to ask the question , all of -- we need to think about this .
and there is , i think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
but we create an incredible con@@ tradi@@ ction .
and to try to understand how you can put together simple un@@ its , simple messages over space and time , in a network , and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds .
so now that egyp@@ ti@@ ans have ended mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s 3@@ 0-@@ year rule , they potenti@@ ally could be an example for the region .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islam@@ ic democracy ?
here &apos;s a guy from canada .
anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited .
why ? because it would have been a dis@@ aster for them and for the community if he had let them go .
and would we re@@ ver@@ t back to being more like animals , more pri@@ mal mo@@ des of communication ?
and the girl said , &quot; i &apos;m drawing a picture of god . &quot;
it had the central fluid , it had the surrounding wall , and the rein@@ for@@ cing fi@@ bers in the wall were ar@@ ran@@ ged in cros@@ sed heli@@ ces around the long axis of the skelet@@ on .
and they &apos;re always talking about this stuff . &quot;
our generation does not want its ep@@ it@@ ap@@ h to read , &quot; we kept char@@ ity over@@ head low . &quot;
we share in common the same pa@@ tho@@ gens .
if you express your requ@@ est as a condi@@ tional -- &quot; if you could open the window , that would be great &quot; -- even though the content is an imper@@ ative , the fact that you &apos;re not using the imper@@ ative voice means that you &apos;re not acting as if you &apos;re in a relationship of domin@@ ance , where you could pres@@ upp@@ ose the comp@@ li@@ ance of the other person .
and here you can see these woo@@ den effi@@ gi@@ es of the an@@ ce@@ stors , so these are people who have already been buried , already had a fun@@ er@@ al cer@@ em@@ ony .
we have the high income countries here , with the united states as a leading power ; we have the emerging econom@@ ies in the middle , which provide a lot of the fund@@ ing for the ba@@ il@@ out ; and we have the low income countries here .
within a few weeks , i was performing , and in a few months , i de@@ bu@@ ted at the ken@@ ne@@ dy center .
secon@@ dly -- and you &apos;re going to hear more from me about this -- we have to become an out@@ war@@ d-@@ looking , spac@@ e-@@ far@@ ing nation .
so in 2004 , during my sur@@ gi@@ cal res@@ iden@@ cy , i had the great fortun@@ e to meet dr. ro@@ ger chen , who went on to win the no@@ bel prize for chemi@@ stry in 2008 .
no@@ a : the girls are obviously smarter .
so to address this , we studied u@@ k versus ar@@ av@@ ind .
but this is what we would like to see , isn &apos;t it ?
but yet , it &apos;s the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states .
and the imm@@ une system is more active .
every other form of transpor@@ tation &apos;s been impro@@ ved .
she moved to the united states , where she met my grand@@ father , who was a c@@ ement hau@@ ler , and they had nine children . three of them died as bab@@ ies .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
a large , un@@ ru@@ ly fra@@ ction of our tr@@ ash will flow down@@ river to the sea .
and this is my son .
and i can with all hon@@ est@@ y look her in the eye and say , &quot; because our pher@@ om@@ ones mat@@ ched our ol@@ factory re@@ cep@@ tors . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
how do we feed the world without destro@@ ying it ?
back to -- everything &apos;s so temporary .
no , this is really important to have this sense of scale .
now you can see some of the reasons why i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
only humans can pos@@ s@@ ess things .
so now you put the two things together .
wow . let &apos;s go for it . that &apos;s the kind of stuff .
it &apos;s a condition ; it has to be treated . stri@@ ke two is if you get pre@@ gn@@ ant .
so on the streets , are film ca@@ sts ... ?
when i was about 16 years old i can remember fli@@ pping through chan@@ n@@ els at home during summer vac@@ ation , looking for a movie to watch on h@@ b@@ o -- and how many of you remember &quot; fer@@ ris bu@@ eller &apos;s day off &quot; ?
we dropped them g@@ ently in .
a mal@@ n@@ our@@ ished child being measu@@ red as part of the supp@@ le@@ mental fe@@ eding program .
so , i tried to work on the standard model of culture , which is , develop stories , symb@@ ols and ritu@@ als .
so , jun@@ e it ra@@ ins , so many a times all of us would be hu@@ dd@@ led under the tin ro@@ of , waiting for the rain to stop .
so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
they were too young to survive without their mother .
so that is au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous , you say . i agree .
i exist because there are stories , and if there are no stories , we don &apos;t exist .
as i realized , just like with many many things in my life that i actually love , i adap@@ t to it .
and you know what it fe@@ els like : all of that un@@ certain@@ ty while you &apos;re left out in the hall@@ way while the do@@ cs are de@@ aling with some more urgent case in one of the emer@@ gency ro@@ oms , wondering what the he@@ ck &apos;s going on .
ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity depen@@ ded on you being the active pen@@ etr@@ ator .
squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s , for example , would show up , look for the pe@@ an@@ u@@ t , go away .
and this br@@ ings up the whole thing of my science teacher .
so this turned out to be very simple to do .
we have char@@ ted our love for our child over time .
so , it &apos;s not a pal@@ m pil@@ ot by any stre@@ tch of the imagination , but it has a th@@ um@@ b@@ -@@ sc@@ roll so you can do everything with one hand .
we are very interested in deli@@ ver@@ ing health care in the developing world , and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagn@@ osis at as close to zero cost as we can man@@ age .
basically , i was brought up to be a good sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an , and i am .
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth , but is all made of eth@@ ane and me@@ than@@ e and organic material .
because i look at the way women are portra@@ yed all the time .
with an inspi@@ rational lea@@ der , i think this year , the opening of the t@@ all@@ est tower in the world is like ad@@ ding a finger to that hand , that points at all those who spread fall@@ aci@@ ous stories about us .
and in this case , they did .
it zo@@ oms it off to the appropriate person , it tells you when the time li@@ mit is coming to an end , it keeps track of all the cor@@ respon@@ dence , it po@@ sts it up there , and it becomes an archi@@ ve of public knowledge .
nm : so it wouldn &apos;t be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit &apos; em .
get your te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one up . get your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
my job depends upon it .
well , let &apos;s go back to this picture .
to make a product , to market an idea , to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn &apos;t have a const@@ it@@ u@@ ency with an ot@@ ak@@ u , is almost impossible .
what kind of forms could we design if we wouldn &apos;t work with re@@ ferences anymore ?
not as many vot@@ es .
so i &apos;m trying to bridge this ga@@ p between this idea and this mel@@ o@@ dy .
i actually realized once in kos@@ ov@@ o , when i wat@@ ched a man break down , that bul@@ lets are actually har@@ den@@ ed tears , that when we don &apos;t allow men to have their girl self and have their vulner@@ ability , and have their compassion , and have their he@@ arts , that they become har@@ den@@ ed and hur@@ t@@ ful and violent .
the graduate students in san@@ ji@@ v tal@@ war &apos;s lab said , &quot; is this eth@@ ical ?
dev@@ du@@ tt pat@@ tan@@ ai@@ k takes an eye@@ -@@ opening look at the my@@ ths of india and of the west -- and shows how these two fundament@@ ally different sets of belie@@ fs about god , death and heaven help us consi@@ st@@ ently mis@@ understand one another .
so you have this one last fac@@ ade of the house , the front , which is really a car@@ to@@ on of a fac@@ ade of a house .
they &apos;re at the start of food cha@@ ins .
the fur@@ th@@ est i &apos;ve ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004 . i still don &apos;t know exactly what came over me , but my plan was to make a sol@@ o and un@@ supported crossing of the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean .
but actually it &apos;s my belief that the people who &apos;ve been truly cap@@ itali@@ zing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until recent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ itali@@ zing most on the age of behavior and the trans@@ national alle@@ gi@@ ances , using digital ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and other sorts of bor@@ der@@ less technologies , those who &apos;ve been benef@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mi@@ sts .
we make sure that the tele@@ medicine plat@@ form gives access to exper@@ t medical speci@@ ali@@ sts anywhere in the world , just by a cli@@ ck of the butt@@ on .
these little girls turned to him and said , &quot; we will vote you out of office . &quot;
they were living on top of the work@@ shops where they were working .
both my parents were edu@@ cat@@ ors , my ma@@ tern@@ al grand@@ parents were edu@@ cat@@ ors , and for the past 40 years i &apos;ve done the same thing .
moral ambigu@@ ity becomes the domin@@ ant me@@ me in television from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
i &apos;m going to do what philosop@@ hers do .
now , not all of us have me@@ a@@ dows , or law@@ ns that we can conver@@ t , and so you can always , of course , grow a me@@ a@@ dow in a pot .
so we were left with this idea that we ended up calling &quot; technology ste@@ w . &quot;
and her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil sp@@ ills .
i asked her what that meant , and she said , &quot; miss , it &apos;s kind of a long story . &quot;
i wi@@ shed to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us , but how we respon@@ d to what happens to us .
in our study , they are more positive , but they &apos;re also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions -- sa@@ dness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that te@@ ar in the eye when you &apos;re sm@@ iling at a friend .
well , the nor@@ th@@ west pas@@ sage is already there .
imagine if mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king had said , &quot; i have a dream .
umar is an excep@@ tional kid in excep@@ tional circumstances .
how do you do that ?
but there &apos;s still a sort of fil@@ ling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
and every green space we create is an invi@@ tation for non-@@ humans to co@@ hab@@ it with us .
i &apos;m hon@@ or@@ ed by the invi@@ tation , and thanks .
no , no , no .
we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
what the fu@@ ck are you talking about ?
so , starting with the political philosoph@@ y .
and then when you add the l@@ ens to that , you can b@@ und@@ le the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to sp@@ ill any light to the sky or anywhere else .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laugh@@ ing is bad for humans too .
so those are very important for cat@@ ching somebody who &apos;s trying to s@@ ne@@ ak up on you .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
and they &apos;re in@@ scri@@ bed in there forever -- like the mar@@ ch on wash@@ ing@@ ton for jobs and freedom and the great speech that mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king gave there .
but one thing i do know is this : the bad press that clou@@ ds get is totally un@@ fair .
and one fur@@ ther@@ more has the impul@@ se to gener@@ alize , as much as possible , in defin@@ ing who that ene@@ my is .
wait . the same study found that sm@@ iling is as stimul@@ ating as recei@@ ving up to 16@@ ,000 pounds ster@@ ling in cash .
it is time for us to a@@ im higher when it comes to women , to invest more and to dep@@ lo@@ y our dollars to benef@@ it women all around the world .
and one of the things we tend to do as adults , again , is we ed@@ it things .
a recent study found b@@ pa in 9@@ 3 percent of people six and older .
the coun@@ ter ser@@ ves as a tem@@ plate to f@@ ill in a square in the middle of this thing .
they &apos;re here . you can see i &apos;ve done three so far ; i &apos;ve got a few more to go .
because , if you don &apos;t know yet , everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these stor@@ ms , comes from these stor@@ ms that roll over the h@@ ills and val@@ le@@ ys of our brains and define our memor@@ ies , our belie@@ fs , our feel@@ ings , our plan@@ s for the future .
and the next generation fi@@ ber will be simply magic .
the world is changing with really remarkable speed .
home electr@@ on@@ ics .
about that time he was at the d.@@ school at stanford taking clas@@ ses .
well , so much for quanti@@ ty . how about quality ?
they have a hu@@ t that has no electricity , no running water , no wri@@ st@@ watch , no bicycle .
i was called down to the ward to see him by a res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory physi@@ cian .
and he said , &quot; it &apos;s funny you ask that , because it &apos;s actually called black box tra@@ ding .
and there are six or seven similar cases repor@@ ted in the liter@@ ature .
and you just draw a stick figure , and it calcul@@ ates the cre@@ ase pattern .
and we need a transfor@@ mation .
it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t putting me at the top of this list ; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gam@@ ed all of the top 21 places to sp@@ ell &quot; mar@@ ble@@ ca@@ ke . also , the game . &quot;
we discovered they work by inter@@ mole@@ cular forces alone .
fundament@@ ally it &apos;s a consumption issue .
if any place in the world can build an air@@ plane to fly on mars , it &apos;s the lang@@ ley research center , for almost 100 years a leading center of aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics in the world .
but she was sick with worry : she worried her son would be ab@@ du@@ cted and taken off to be a child soldier , she worried her dau@@ gh@@ ters would be rap@@ ed , she worried for their lives .
in the mean@@ time i &apos;m also talking to you , so my life is going to complicated . bear with me .
prin@@ ces pat@@ r@@ on@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ing@@ ra@@ ti@@ ating themselves to the british rul@@ ers .
just moving on , is it possible , taking that idea of mind , body , bo@@ dy@@ -@@ building , to sup@@ plant the first body , the biological body , with the second , the body of architecture and the built environment .
how can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a was@@ hing machine ?
if it were called the cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ king board , tu@@ mb@@ le@@ wee@@ ds would be blo@@ wing through it .
this basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame , and on the right side you see that frame as interpre@@ ted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they &apos;re doing .
and , for sure , i haven &apos;t looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .
and this is really what has to be changed .
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .
but in reality , it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and explo@@ it it .
these little green pe@@ a@@ ks are astero@@ id colli@@ sions .
i &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
so instead of saying , &quot; you guys go off into that bun@@ ker and come back with a cell phone or a social network , &quot; you say , &quot; you go off and come up with one element , then bring it back . let &apos;s talk about it . let &apos;s adap@@ t . &quot;
we can only make them , quote , &quot; p@@ ir@@ ates . &quot; and is that good ?
so what you &apos;ve done is to take a technology , which is available everywhere , make a device , which is extremely cheap , and make it in such a fashion that it is very , very reli@@ able .
how will we be remember@@ ed in 200 years ?
well during the se@@ tt@@ lement process , when we recei@@ ved our copy , i struck it .
and i ha@@ te that . how do we bub@@ ble stuff up to the surface that &apos;s maybe really creative and interesting ?
but then , of course , the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work .
i want my grand@@ son , daniel , and his friends and his generation , throughout the world , to know the story of big history , and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us .
in 10 years , it &apos;s set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
and the art of conversation is being re@@ placed -- danger@@ ously , i think -- by personal broad@@ ca@@ sting .
see for me , cul@@ tiv@@ ating the infin@@ ity mus@@ h@@ room is more than just scientific experim@@ entation or gar@@ den@@ ing or rais@@ ing a pet , it &apos;s a step towards accep@@ ting the fact that some@@ day i will die and deca@@ y .
i swa@@ m as hard as i could for five minutes .
compassion is also curious .
but the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : we need a universal con@@ ception of human values .
and it is important .
and all together with those other 7@@ 7 you &apos;re not seeing , that &apos;s my bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al .
few of you would eat it if it &apos;s a rat or a human .
it is extremely un@@ likely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely un@@ likely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
and one docum@@ ent@@ ary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after i was here , descri@@ bed this not as be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves but as a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , with these emp@@ ty white boxes with no be@@ es left in them .
and if you look at another fac@@ tor , another contr@@ ast , a s@@ la@@ ve back then is worth about $ 4@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money .
so in order to fa@@ ke the ability to sell un@@ copy@@ able bits , the d@@ m@@ ca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the cop@@ ying function of your devices .
so then i measu@@ red , and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mis@@ pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced , but correct us@@ age -- words like ex@@ it , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day conver@@ sa@@ tions .
and the man who talked at that ev@@ ening lec@@ ture was very interesting .
and he told me , &quot; well , what do you mean , you want to go ?
used to be , there were two mu@@ star@@ ds . french &apos;s and gul@@ den &apos;s .
this is a fashion show we held in london .
and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poor@@ er families in the village , they were one of the most respe@@ cted families in the village .
and you see him do it again .
and at that point , i read a book by frank bar@@ n@@ ab@@ y , this wonderful nuclear physi@@ c@@ ist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all se@@ ctors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dra@@ matic fl@@ our@@ ish , and out comes the universal solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . in this particular case , a camera phone .
but they &apos;re doing some really interesting things around cho@@ col@@ ate , and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future .
but what makes the r@@ oss sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provi@@ des a wealth of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on and kri@@ ll that suppor@@ ts what , till recently , has been a virtually in@@ tact ne@@ ar-@@ sh@@ ore ecosystem .
what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night , so the mos@@ quit@@ os that bi@@ te late at night can &apos;t get at them .
these have to be identi@@ fied by scientific investig@@ ation .
among those who &apos;ve helped open my eyes to a third way are : a dev@@ out musli@@ m in afghanistan , a group of har@@ mon@@ i@@ zing les@@ bi@@ ans in cro@@ a@@ ti@@ a and a tab@@ o@@ o break@@ er in liber@@ ia .
and let me tell you , with all the science and technology at our comm@@ and , millions of women still carry water on their heads .
i can as@@ sure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bi@@ gs , going into mana@@ gement ain &apos;t no success story . it &apos;s a fail@@ ure .
von mis@@ es , interest@@ ingly , belie@@ ves economics is just a sub@@ set of psych@@ ology .
and it really changed the landscape of surgery .
just re@@ lie@@ ving your arms with arm@@ re@@ sts takes 20 percent of that load off .
and it takes place in an area called the she@@ ph@@ el@@ ah in what is now israel .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion or any exist@@ ing mathematics today .
but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vi@@ tality , the aspi@@ ration and the ambi@@ tion of the people who live there : women was@@ hing their bab@@ ies , was@@ hing their clo@@ th@@ es , hanging them out to dry .
and for some time , he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well .
and think of things in your life that are bin@@ ary , one of them is light swi@@ t@@ ches .
50 companies sig@@ ned up , 200 products came out , gener@@ ated 100 million in sales .
they find it here .
h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the marsh@@ mal@@ low ; one out of three did not .
so for instance , by measuring the genome , we &apos;ve learned a lot about how we &apos;re related to other kinds of animals by the clos@@ eness of our genome , or how we &apos;re related to each other -- the family tree , or the tree of life .
the team from tai@@ wan was a little bit more ambi@@ tious .
and we use that as a moral ti@@ ck@@ le .
the normal example , let &apos;s take the human mam@@ mary gland .
so all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all add up to our idea of con@@ science .
the fifth foundation is pu@@ ri@@ ty / san@@ cti@@ ty .
people were tex@@ ting from their phones . they were taking photos of buildings .
it &apos;s about embra@@ cing the para@@ dox .
as you see a new set of social rel@@ ations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . some of them are to@@ ol@@ ma@@ kers .
in fact , we think she has a b@@ ou@@ ti@@ que somewhere in the ba@@ ham@@ as .
so , tax@@ i jour@@ ne@@ ys might be one example .
so that &apos;s one way of going about it .
i just want to thank you on be@@ half of new yor@@ kers for making this happen and getting this done .
when the astronom@@ ical distance between the reali@@ ties of the acade@@ my and the visi@@ on@@ ary intensi@@ ty of this challenge were more than enough , i can as@@ sure you , what was happening outside higher education made bac@@ king off un@@ thin@@ k@@ able .
but by 1960 , people could attack ra@@ ven &apos;s on a much more sophisticated level .
avi@@ ation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the mo@@ vers and sha@@ kers of the first 100 years of avi@@ ation .
but in the whole coun@@ ty there is no coffee shop , there &apos;s no internet caf@@ e , there &apos;s no movie theater , there &apos;s no boo@@ k@@ store .
so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .
and we &apos;re ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life , and it goes on , and he has , you know , many advent@@ ures .
so that &apos;s a sort of star@@ bucks currency sta@@ ying within its ecosystem .
and i said , &quot; well , i would just , every student work at their own p@@ ace on something like this and we &apos;d give a d@@ ash@@ board . &quot;
we can &apos;t believe how pre@@ valent lying is .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appe@@ ars to be em@@ bed@@ ded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
so that was the basis of it , was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
now what does that mean ?
if people have no in@@ cen@@ tive to avo@@ id aids on their own , even if they know everything about the disease , they still may not change their behavior .
half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of co@@ operation locked inside .
they could slow down by about 50 percent .
these became the two boo@@ ken@@ ds of his life , and the journey he travel@@ ed in between mi@@ rr@@ or@@ ed the changing development landscape .
and you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video speci@@ fi@@ cally for you , pulling in google maps and street@@ view images into the experience itself .
return rate -- the one that sor@@ os was so worried about -- 9@@ 7 percent .
i read that last year the pu@@ p mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the gulf of st. la@@ wr@@ ence .
well , consider by analo@@ g@@ y , the concept of physical health .
come talk to me about it , i &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the details if you want .
we had , in australi@@ a , drop cro@@ cs . they really do exist .
the design is there in nature , but it &apos;s not in anybody &apos;s head .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thro@@ wn away .
i say that because these are difficult patients .
first of all , because we can &apos;t shape what we don &apos;t understand , and what we don &apos;t understand and use ends up shap@@ ing us .
when you have a digital camera , how do you get the pictures back to your computer ?
these , of course , are the des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization .
thank you very much .
and therefore , you &apos;re not talking about incre@@ mental innovation , you &apos;re talking about dis@@ rup@@ tive innovation .
for a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or writing .
and we look at this and we think , well , how does that apply , for example , for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services , future services in these markets ?
this slide illu@@ str@@ ates the elements of a my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za .
in the 19@@ th century , if you had a bas@@ ement lab , you could make major scientific dis@@ cover@@ ies in your own home . right ? because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up .
there are many reasons , but the two that mer@@ it the little bit of time is : one , the cl@@ ar@@ ity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
so the united states keeps a data set of every f@@ at@@ al acci@@ dent that &apos;s happened since 197@@ 5 .
now , i &apos;m not anti@@ -@@ hospital .
oec@@ d countries , by and large , you should think about these as the rich@@ est , most industri@@ alized countries in the world .
we &apos;re concer@@ ned in the national security community , and of course in the biology community and the public health community .
look at the site that he built : &quot; star wars &quot; ma@@ shu@@ ps , invi@@ ting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extra@@ ordin@@ arily important cultural ic@@ on .
that &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
plan@@ k number three : tell your story .
the first is the fall of gran@@ ada , the last musli@@ m en@@ c@@ la@@ ve in europe .
it has opened up opportunities to do more projects in gand@@ o .
and we are last place in so many things -- for example , social factors .
granted , we &apos;re not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own la@@ unch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there &apos;s so many other things that we &apos;re doing .
his wife was standing behind me .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking forward to . that is where we &apos;re going -- this union , this conver@@ gence of the atom@@ ic and the digital .
mine was 1@@ 46 .
white is the syn@@ thesis .
it &apos;s urgent work . we know that temperat@@ ures are rising .
also , genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is in@@ tri@@ cat@@ ely struc@@ tured .
thank you so much .
and the links repres@@ ent the shar@@ eh@@ ol@@ ding rel@@ ations , so shar@@ eh@@ older a has x percent of the shares in company b .
when he goes to work , he doesn &apos;t stop by to talk to anybody , he doesn &apos;t call .
he &apos;s very bad , le@@ o .
we want it to be bi@@ -@@ dire@@ c@@ tional .
and those are those ca@@ st-@@ ir@@ on things you see at anti@@ que shops .
so we looked at the mo@@ dem , an important part of the infrastructure of the internet , and asked ourselves why the mo@@ de@@ ms that we are using right now are built for a different context , where you &apos;ve got ubi@@ quit@@ ous internet , you &apos;ve got ubi@@ quit@@ ous electricity , yet we sit here in na@@ i@@ rob@@ i and we do not have that lu@@ x@@ ury .
and once you can do that , you create the kind of self-@@ knowledge that en@@ ables self-@@ ma@@ ster@@ y .
there is a girl , ju@@ li@@ a bu@@ tter@@ fly h@@ ill , who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild o@@ a@@ ks .
what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials ?
their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them .
as political tur@@ mo@@ il in yemen contin@@ ues , the edi@@ tor of the yemen times , na@@ dia al-@@ sak@@ ka@@ f , talks at ted@@ global with h@@ ost p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell . al-@@ sak@@ ka@@ f &apos;s independent , engli@@ sh@@ -@@ language paper is vital for sharing news -- and for sharing a new vision of yemen and of that country &apos;s women as equal part@@ ners in work and change .
secon@@ dly , shifting from a lin@@ e@@ ar , wa@@ ste@@ ful , poll@@ u@@ ting way of using resources to a clos@@ e@@ d-@@ loo@@ p model .
they are , like other young people , negoti@@ ating a world with infin@@ ite choice , but little culture of how to find mean@@ ing@@ ful experience .
in so doing , i reach@@ ed a fron@@ tier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
and i don &apos;t know anymore where to put them .
so on this tour , i hope i provi@@ ded you with a new perspective of the high se@@ as : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all .
so it &apos;s just -- thanks .
so we set up an experiment wher@@ e@@ by we put a na@@ ked volunte@@ er in a large c@@ age , and in that c@@ age we rele@@ ased mos@@ quit@@ os to see where they were bit@@ ing on the body of that person .
you all know the story , right .
and who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
don &apos;t let anything ever stop you . &quot; she fin@@ ish@@ es , and a man stands up and he says , &quot; i &apos;m from pakistan ; i &apos;m a musli@@ m .
and with all of our modern teles@@ cop@@ es , we &apos;ve been able to collect this st@@ unning sil@@ ent movie of the universe -- these series of s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ ots that go all the way back to the big ban@@ g .
nt : yes , that was a big mistake .
but i &apos;m not here to share these stories about these two things exactly .
let &apos;s go back to the home .
but it was around this time i went to camp s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine to volunte@@ er a week and working with the most amazing kids , kids with leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , and this kid eric changed my life .
they &apos;re like the mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ ben@@ z of the ri@@ ft valley .
by the way , i must ad@@ mit , my english is not so good , i didn &apos;t know what is sc@@ ro@@ tal ; i understand it &apos;s a sc@@ ro@@ t@@ um .
we &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of contain@@ ment .
so , because this is as much a philosop@@ hi@@ cal adv@@ ance as a technical adv@@ ance in science , we tried to deal with both the philosop@@ hi@@ cal and the technical side .
i &apos;m pro@@ gressi@@ ve , poli@@ tically -- big surprise -- but i &apos;ve always gone out of my way to meet conserva@@ tives .
and that moved us to the next level .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; right , well .
how do you know it when you find it ?
two , it &apos;s easier to be auth@@ enti@@ c if you don &apos;t say you &apos;re auth@@ enti@@ c .
so we actually per@@ f@@ use first the blood v@@ es@@ sel tree with the patient &apos;s own blood v@@ es@@ sel cells , and we then in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the par@@ en@@ ch@@ y@@ ma with the li@@ ver cells .
the topic that it &apos;s focused on , the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are aff@@ ecting people &apos;s ability to ear@@ n a living , or , to say it a little bit different way , are the dro@@ i@@ ds taking our jobs ?
most school distri@@ cts spend two thir@@ ds of that on pay@@ roll and over@@ head .
well , then let &apos;s go to a simpler explanation .
h@@ ello . my name is jar@@ re@@ tt kros@@ oc@@ z@@ ka , and i write and illu@@ strate books for children for a living .
the gu@@ il@@ d system : that means when i was an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , i had to app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce myself in order to become a pot@@ tery master .
so , he was very sa@@ tis@@ fied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years .
that &apos;s all , shu@@ kr@@ an . thank you very much for the opportunity .
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , &quot; okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supp@@ lement .
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry .
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
grand@@ mother : well done ! very good .
but just to cl@@ ari@@ fy , the 25 billion dollars is gr@@ oss , right ? that &apos;s gr@@ oss ?
here it is in a flat flo@@ or con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation .
right .
however , there &apos;s always kinds of comp@@ lications in this .
maybe the next al@@ bert einstein or the next steve jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in africa .
and we can make those mark@@ ers glo@@ w .
it was a lot like the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st cover@@ age , it was buried in the paper .
even the printing press , even the printing press was assu@@ med to be a tool that was going to en@@ force ca@@ tho@@ lic intellectual he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y across europe .

and why are they reading this ? &quot;
we don &apos;t have to in@@ je@@ ct anything . we don &apos;t need radiation .
it &apos;s a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect em@@ mer@@ ich to cast bra@@ d pit@@ t in his next movie dig@@ ging lat@@ r@@ ines in tanz@@ ania or something .
it was first ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ated in 196@@ 1 as they were building la@@ x , although scientists believe that it dat@@ es back to the year 2000 before common era , when it was used as a bus@@ y trans@@ dimensional space port by the ancient astron@@ au@@ ts who first colon@@ ized this planet and raised our species from sa@@ va@@ gery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revol@@ ving restau@@ ran@@ ts .
and if two years ago you didn &apos;t take a pro@@ motion and some guy next to you did , if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities , you &apos;re going to be bor@@ ed because you should have kept your foot on the gas pe@@ d@@ al .
so that &apos;s two points for insects .
as many as 16@@ 5 million people would die .
co : we walked up to the church because we heard that they had hot me@@ als , but when we arri@@ ved we found problems .
then , your other exc@@ use is , &quot; yes , there are special people who pur@@ sue their passi@@ ons , but they are geni@@ uses .
i was asked by wil@@ son@@ art international , a plastic lam@@ in@@ ate company , which is the largest plastic lam@@ in@@ ate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show bo@@ oth for ex@@ hibi@@ tion at the international contemporary fur@@ ni@@ ture fair in new york , in 2000 .
i don &apos;t know that that would have been my life ambi@@ tion .
well , we &apos;ll get married next than@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
this is the phr@@ ase that i &apos;ve used in some stuff which i &apos;ve done with a think tank in london called demo@@ s , where we &apos;ve been looking at these people who are ama@@ teur@@ s -- i.@@ e. , they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards .
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
this light up here is the same light that occur@@ s in every midd@@ le-@@ class fo@@ yer in america .
this yo@@ yo right here cost 1@@ 12 dollars , but it sle@@ ep@@ s for 12 minutes .
and about 20 years went by .
and over the course of 30 years , i recorded traditional tal@@ es from alex , mostly myth@@ ological accoun@@ ts of w@@ y-@@ g@@ he@@ t , the trick@@ ster transfor@@ mer of git@@ x@@ san l@@ ore who , in his fol@@ ly , taught the people how to live on the land .
why do people see the vir@@ gin mary on a che@@ ese sandwich or hear demon@@ ic l@@ y@@ ri@@ cs in &quot; sta@@ ir@@ way to heaven &quot; ? using video and music , skep@@ tic michael s@@ her@@ mer shows how we convince ourselves to believe -- and over@@ look the facts .
these c@@ ables were on the side of the bridge , like if you took a rub@@ ber band and stre@@ tched it t@@ aut across the th@@ am@@ es -- that &apos;s what &apos;s holding up this bridge .
so o@@ vari@@ an cancer is one of those cancers that most people don &apos;t know about , or at least don &apos;t pay that much attention to .

g@@ ary green@@ berg : the beautiful nan@@ o details of our world
today &apos;s religions are brilli@@ antly designed -- brilli@@ antly designed .
and it &apos;s really difficult to re@@ call , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best .
think about knowing that over time .
another rather large investig@@ ation is around world di@@ p@@ lo@@ macy .
this is not the story of how you get shelf space at nei@@ man mar@@ cus .
and when i started out , i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the cli@@ ents and stuff .
it &apos;s my beautiful baby .
but judge rus@@ sell did have an alternative .
now our usual tac@@ tics for tac@@ kl@@ ing problems like these are to do more training , give people more speci@@ alization or bring in more technology .
we are a global organization . this is a global phenomenon .
a fair@@ ly famous illusion -- it was first done with mar@@ gar@@ et th@@ at@@ cher .
the work involves hundreds of different cro@@ ch@@ et models .
they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recogni@@ zes facial expres@@ sions , what facial expres@@ sions you &apos;re making .
the knowledge bub@@ ble that si@@ ts around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- b@@ und@@ le that together and where do we come out ?
when you think about that , let me go back to what li@@ on@@ el tri@@ ll@@ ing , in his semin@@ al book on auth@@ en@@ ticity , &quot; sin@@ cer@@ ity and auth@@ en@@ ticity &quot; -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the semin@@ al point at which auth@@ en@@ ticity entered the le@@ xic@@ on , if you will .
now it &apos;s just five times , and soon it will be 2@@ .@@ 5 times .
it &apos;s about as mysteri@@ ous as the li@@ qui@@ di@@ ty of water .
if you look at other east asi@@ an countries , women there play a hu@@ gely important role in terms of economic ta@@ ke-@@ off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing mi@@ ra@@ cle associated with east asia .
when i came to the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos 40 years ago , there were 3,000 people that lived in the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
then here come the mar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers and the adver@@ tis@@ ers .
and perhaps one day we &apos;ll be able to t@@ ack@@ le the problem of solid plastic waste .
the idea is that basically -- if it &apos;s constantly like &quot; huh ? ... huh ? &quot;
here i just brought it back to its original state .
sorry . changing state and literally en@@ ding up in an un@@ desi@@ red situation , where new bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cal logic takes over , new species take over , and the system gets locked .
so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eli@@ min@@ ating negative motivation .
and everybody knows that these three animals are related .
now , i &apos;m at the keyboard on the left , and this is actually the first time that we tried this .
and so , we launched our own t@@ 20 leagu@@ e .
the north atlan@@ tic right whale is li@@ sted as the most en@@ danger@@ ed species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east co@@ ast of north america , united states and canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
with two mi@@ rr@@ ors , the scan@@ ner calcul@@ ates the be@@ am &apos;s hori@@ zon@@ tal and ver@@ tical an@@ gles , giving accur@@ ate x , y , and z co@@ ordin@@ ates .
that same word , &quot; normal , &quot; had two different , almost opposite mean@@ ings .
and the reason these young guys told me that they &apos;re doing these ted@@ x &apos;s is because they were sick and ti@@ red of the only work@@ shops coming to the sl@@ ums being those work@@ shops focused on hiv , or at best , micro@@ fin@@ ance .
it used to look like this , and now it &apos;s more like this , with fruit and ve@@ g and her@@ bs spr@@ ou@@ ting up all over the place .
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cu@@ be ? ok .
so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
and the reason he &apos;s wa@@ ited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those lar@@ va@@ e will hat@@ ch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
and that means that your micro@@ bi@@ al hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ kers are moving with you .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
there is a potential to do good as well .
so when i show the si@@ ms , i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the si@@ ms , not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the ta@@ mag@@ ot@@ ch@@ i .
y@@ ang lan , a journalist and entrepreneur who &apos;s been called &quot; the op@@ ra@@ h of china , &quot; off@@ ers insight into the next generation of young chinese citizens -- urban , connected and al@@ ert to in@@ justice .

and singap@@ ore pro@@ pos@@ es by 20@@ 60 to produce &#91; 9@@ 00 &#93; million li@@ ters per day of des@@ al@@ in@@ ated water .
right now , it &apos;s kind of an all-@@ or@@ -@@ nothing pro@@ position .
if you were going to go and try to create spac@@ es@@ hip@@ one , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and main@@ tain that fund@@ ing with an un@@ certain out@@ come .
we need to take a really positive view .
that means that gl@@ ac@@ ier &apos;s floating and it &apos;s un@@ stable , and you &apos;re about to see the con@@ sequences of that floating .
you &apos;re building on people &apos;s ideas and values -- that perhaps they &apos;re cand@@ les that burn very di@@ m@@ ly on certain occas@@ i@@ ons .
and the more technical top@@ ics , such as architecture , materials and , str@@ angel@@ y enough , men , those are not good top@@ ics to talk about .
tam@@ ara rou@@ ka@@ er@@ ts : we &apos;re ready to go .
it sen@@ ses the food ; it knows exactly what to do .
the data shows this very clearly .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning weak@@ n@@ esses that are not self-@@ corre@@ cting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be scre@@ ened for and dete@@ cted and corre@@ cted and avo@@ id their academic fail@@ ure .
i wanted to have humor , beauty , simpli@@ city and complexity and use metaph@@ ors to suggest ideas .
now , here &apos;s what &apos;s real interesting , after they &apos;d been working for a couple years , what do you think happened to those nations ?
we kill about 100 million sharks a year .
ali@@ ce &apos;s daughter told me that every time ali@@ ce went head@@ -@@ to-@@ head with a fel@@ low scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
this is actually the last little image we have of him .
i can as@@ sure you there &apos;s de@@ ception there .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know@@ -@@ how out there .
now , where is it ?
now that begins with economic power , but that &apos;s the way it always begins .
con@@ sumers don &apos;t really like these light bul@@ bs .
and i think that &apos;s probably right .
but so did most of the fla@@ g-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers , except sophi@@ a l@@ oren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion .
it is what you in@@ fer about that room .
and david found that there were many problems that technology could not solve .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
i couldn &apos;t thre@@ ad a need@@ le or see the li@@ ce in my hair .
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see .
but i &apos;m one . i can do something .
they ru@@ mble the bel@@ ly and leave even photograp@@ hers in a@@ we watching the spectac@@ le .
so , how far does e@@ ter@@ nity go ?
here &apos;s the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosop@@ hers , for go@@ ver@@ ning people , for econom@@ ists , for scientists .
and we can see brain vol@@ umes up to 40 percent less in these children .
her dream of going to school , her wish of being edu@@ cated , is finally here .
big , but less than half the size of super@@ cro@@ c &apos;s sk@@ ull .
this is age versus cost of health care .
when the history books get written , i think our age will be remember@@ ed for three things .
tan@@ i@@ y@@ ama tried and tried and tried and he could never pro@@ ve that it was true .
so if you were in pal@@ m spr@@ ings ...
the good thing is that we are not power@@ less .
i particularly like the little lin@@ u@@ x pengu@@ in in the back .
not only are economic moti@@ va@@ tions and in@@ trin@@ sic moti@@ va@@ tions in@@ com@@ pati@@ ble , that in@@ com@@ pati@@ bility can pers@@ ist over long peri@@ ods .
there &apos;s never been an angel@@ - or a vent@@ u@@ re-@@ fund@@ ed company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lan@@ es of the road and obstac@@ les .
and we take sam@@ ples of the se@@ di@@ ment , and it tells us the co2 level of the ocean , and therefore the co2 level of the atmosphere .
did that require , as an architect , a new way of thinking about what you were doing ?
not only financial cris@@ es , but because of the san@@ it@@ ary pad research , i come through all sorts of problems , including a di@@ vor@@ ce notice from my wife .
and so , from an enter@@ prise perspective for africa , and from a public health perspective , these are real success@@ es .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
if it &apos;s hit , don &apos;t cross the street . &quot;
bol@@ tz@@ mann gave us a formul@@ a -- en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ stone now -- that really quanti@@ fi@@ es what entrop@@ y is .
the pyramid , if we ja@@ m things in the bottom , can get bac@@ ked up like a se@@ wer line that &apos;s clo@@ g@@ ged .
great people have made commit@@ ments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear .
you just bring the 3d prin@@ ter and print the gun while you &apos;re here , and , of course , the maga@@ zin@@ es for your bul@@ lets .
the problem is , at the end of the line , it &apos;s 4@@ 50 vol@@ ts .
her wish was to mar@@ ry someone with a car .
and sexual behavior is not con@@ fin@@ ed to one aspect of their life that they sort of set asi@@ de .
i &apos;ve spent time with women in afghanistan under the taliban , who were essentially bru@@ tali@@ zed and cen@@ sor@@ ed .
we tend to think of energy use as a behavi@@ or@@ al thing -- i choose to turn this light switch on -- but really , enormous amounts of our energy use are pre@@ dest@@ ined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in .
it really is his name .
the only problem was there &apos;s no mouse model of this rare cancer .
and you can see here that the f@@ lash of light has exactly the same effect .
that &apos;s also why , perhaps , most of the drugs , and not all , on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too .
and they &apos;re just so un@@ comfortable .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just cover@@ ing the vas@@ cular tissues .
we have two iden@@ tical ti@@ les , on the left , one in a dark surro@@ und , one in a light surro@@ und .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s defen@@ si@@ ble , but i &apos;d really be pleas@@ ed to get your answers on that -- any re@@ actions to that -- later .
about six years ago , i bought one of these c@@ n@@ c m@@ ills , to just re@@ place , kind of , young people cu@@ tting their fing@@ ers off all the time building models .
they &apos;re part of your life . they &apos;re not necessarily a separate thing .
but it &apos;s also very serious because all this acc@@ essi@@ bility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
americans , incredibly gener@@ ous people -- over 300 billion a year , don@@ ated to char@@ ity every year , compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top 17 industri@@ alized nations at 120 billion .
i worked alone .
by the way , a me@@ al for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spider mit@@ es , of the bad mit@@ es , or 15 to 20 eggs of the p@@ est mit@@ es .
our model of security around electricity is something we were born into .
so i said to the psychiat@@ r@@ ist , &apos; i get sexual pleasure from crash@@ ing cars into walls . &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; what else ? &quot;
the years -- and until i stopped looking at the poll@@ s , you were sort of regar@@ ded as this great hero in the u.k. and el@@ sewhere .
oh , it &apos;s so sad .
it &apos;s really a wh@@ ol@@ ly separate radiation .
one woman los@@ es six .
and the teacher was constantly scan@@ ning to see which kids weren &apos;t paying attention , which kids were bor@@ ed , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board .
so that &apos;s essentially the compu@@ ta@@ tional equi@@ valent of two light swi@@ t@@ ches .
we need groups to work together that never have .
and nature is part of the generator , the dri@@ ver for this building .
and that &apos;s the sad part .
that is the big question .
so , in the col@@ dest place on earth , they work inside a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
it might be things like , don &apos;t eat that day , or give them a little chemo@@ therapy , maybe a little radiation .
a little bit further on in the article it said &quot; a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-@@ 100 years to re@@ place . &quot;
let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
that &apos;s all i want to say , and i &apos;ve got three minutes left .
nobody was process@@ ing the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds .
but i &apos;m here to tell you , &quot; patient &quot; is not a thir@@ d-@@ person word .
let me begin with an example .
our own emotions and state of mind often en@@ code time , regret or no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a about the past , hope or dre@@ ad about the future .
and in my nature , i guess , i am a do@@ er of things more than i am a spec@@ tat@@ or or a con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ator of things , and it &apos;s that di@@ ch@@ ot@@ om@@ y , the gulf between ideas and action that i &apos;m going to try and explore briefly .
that &apos;s why , i &apos;m trying to say , it &apos;s like me@@ tro@@ -@@ ni@@ zing the bus .
this is very , very simple .
couldn &apos;t find it .
people ask me if i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ tened or re@@ pul@@ sed by particip@@ ating in a culture where the physical mani@@ fe@@ stations of death gre@@ et us at every turn .
which , as chance would have it , was spar@@ tan@@ bur@@ g , south carolina , the location of wofford college .
this would be the natural government response , to hi@@ de away all our government leaders in her@@ me@@ tically se@@ al@@ ed bubbles .
and i heard the ex@@ act same pun@@ ch@@ line on both co@@ a@@ sts -- something about the ig@@ ni@@ ted ne@@ gr@@ o college fund .
and for this reason , many people eat pro@@ bio@@ tic yog@@ urt so they can pro@@ mote a healthy gut fl@@ ora .
they &apos;re photograp@@ hab@@ le . they &apos;re meas@@ ur@@ able .
and this is what it looks like .
these are three of the fo@@ unders of the internet .
why ? how could it happen ?
that famous scene in hor@@ ror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see , and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audi@@ o is turned off or not heard at all , and i spe@@ cul@@ ate that dea@@ f au@@ dien@@ ces might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing au@@ dien@@ ces .
and 55 is a lot . on a per@@ -@@ area basis , manhattan had more ec@@ ological communities per ac@@ re than y@@ os@@ e@@ mi@@ te does , than yel@@ low@@ stone , than am@@ bos@@ el@@ i .
it &apos;s sort of this &quot; du@@ h &quot; thing .
japan here was regar@@ ded as an ex@@ ception .
it &apos;s just the female .
but i hope you &apos;ve convinced yourself now , with this ni@@ ght@@ time video , that they really were very well synchron@@ ized .
other people get hyper@@ -@@ sensitive to the amount of information .
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scared . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addres@@ sing an audience like this .
so what this means now is that those tra@@ its we then look at and so rea@@ di@@ ly see -- facial fe@@ atures , skin color , hair structure -- are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic vari@@ ants that seem to v@@ ary in frequency between different parts of the world .
it reach@@ es up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a di@@ et of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , pri@@ mar@@ ily .
there &apos;s really a tree like that out there . that &apos;s really what it comes to .
which was the building just north of the to@@ wers ?
she said , &quot; please , sing for me . &quot;
society w@@ ins : fewer cri@@ mes , fewer victi@@ ms .
that is not too much , is it ?

i be@@ t most of us have experi@@ enced at some point the jo@@ ys of less : college -- in your dor@@ m , traveling -- in a hotel room , camp@@ ing -- ri@@ g up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
they &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bur@@ y them all in anything but these un@@ mar@@ ked gra@@ ves like this one outside of ci@@ u@@ dad ju@@ ar@@ e@@ z .
what &apos;s going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to ste@@ er away from systems built in the united states .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ el ka@@ hn shares clips from his docum@@ ent@@ ary &quot; my architect , &quot; about his quest to understand his father , the le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y architect louis ka@@ hn . it &apos;s a film with meaning to anyone who see@@ ks to understand the relationship between art and love .
but if you take the same carbon atom@@ s and inter@@ connect them a different way , you get diam@@ ond , which is clear and hard .
unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we &apos;re fac@@ ing an epidemic of neuro@@ logic diseases on a global scale .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.@@ i@@ . on top of radi@@ ology , we can find les@@ i@@ ons that were missed before .
so i went to lou@@ is@@ bur@@ g , north carolina , sou@@ the@@ ast united states , and i entered the world of whist@@ ling .
and here &apos;s this , like , dir@@ ty , kind of , sho@@ d@@ dy , kind of , dark computer room .

our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy , and we know that many other stars have planet@@ ary systems .
let me start off showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to vis@@ ually nar@@ rate a story .
public health care runs on the ash@@ a wor@@ ker , not the doctor .
well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccin@@ es , how to produce them , in the early 194@@ 0s .
they &apos;re 11 and 12 .
the idea was to ask for a so@@ f@@ ter approach to cri@@ min@@ al activity in the state .
but it doesn &apos;t stop there .
i have 12 of these .
and then i want to tell you that this is a map .
and i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s how you know only stupid people go into it . &quot;
and that &apos;s great when i can de@@ grade the tissue .
on the right side you can see my colleague sor@@ en , who &apos;s actually in the space .
the pre@@ dis@@ posi@@ tions and impul@@ ses that had prop@@ elled me as a to@@ dd@@ ler to try and sli@@ p over a boat into a chicago lake , that had prop@@ elled me as a teen to jump into wild cap@@ e co@@ d bay after a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
why is it such an important part of education as a sort of comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y subject ?
in africa , you know , air@@ time has become literally a currency in its own right .
thir@@ teen species -- high@@ est diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
the only thing that really redu@@ ces the amount of oil that we consu@@ me is much higher pri@@ ces .
and i &apos;ve gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with &quot; ma@@ ting in cap@@ tivity , &quot; and i asked people , when do you find yourself most dra@@ wn to your partner ?
derek sivers invented c@@ d baby , which allowed independent musi@@ cians to have a place to sell their music without s@@ elling out to the man -- to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to , and connect with each other .
look at what &apos;s been achiev@@ ed .
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
i thought he would ask for a to@@ y , or cand@@ y , and he asked me for sli@@ p@@ pers , because he said that his feet were cold .
so i decided , kind of told myself , &quot; oh yeah ? watch this . i &apos;ll do it myself . &quot;
i mean , how is it possible ?
the students don &apos;t usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.@@ m .
so it needs re@@ fur@@ bis@@ h@@ ment .
i experim@@ ented with a -- i found a dead fly .
and that -- forget the tools , forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff &apos;s easy .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
and as with amazon , so it is with net@@ fli@@ x .
even the three wise men .
and it took six months to r@@ er@@ ou@@ te it .
and for me , i quickly land@@ ed on this one : the earth has a toler@@ ance of about .@@ 17 percent from the re@@ ference sp@@ hero@@ id , which is less than the .@@ 22 percent allowed in billi@@ ard balls .
i like that , too .
i &apos;m a sa@@ vant , or more precisely , a high-@@ func@@ tion@@ ing auti@@ stic sa@@ vant .
okay ? that had a big effect on me .
you make the text larger with each ta@@ p .
now , if you think about how our world got so acceler@@ ated , the usual suspe@@ cts re@@ ar their heads .
so let &apos;s say you wanted to make deter@@ gent .
a huge opportunity , un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing of new potential for innovation , for development .
i don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s honest .
and something that &apos;s not obvious , that you can &apos;t see , is that it &apos;s psych@@ ologi@@ cally dra@@ ining to walk and to be pre@@ vent@@ ing yourself from fall@@ ing .
it keeps getting rein@@ fe@@ cted .
so what started out as an idea , is now being im@@ ple@@ mented to chur@@ n out millions of sequences that we can use to investig@@ ate the long-@@ term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pa@@ tho@@ gens .
this is something called an under@@ ground forest .
to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach .
&quot; dra@@ wn into this , &quot; like they were se@@ du@@ ced into commit@@ ting an act of violence .
the final sta@@ ges , when i ran the sam@@ ples through a high-@@ pressure li@@ qu@@ id chro@@ ma@@ to@@ graphy mass spec@@ tro@@ meter , which separated the com@@ pounds and analy@@ zed the chemicals and told me exactly how much car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens i had in my chicken .
so , pri@@ zes work great .
you &apos;ll find your own way to dis@@ cover , to learn , to teach .
the re@@ p@@ ly to their requ@@ est@@ s was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysteri@@ ous hand coming out to take their docum@@ ents while search@@ ing through old docum@@ ents for the bri@@ be .
and i felt like saying to him -- but i didn &apos;t say it -- i felt like saying , &quot; you know what ?
one in a million , one in a billion -- they &apos;re both almost never .
many people , i think , on our planet right now des@@ pair , and they think we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a point where we &apos;ve discovered most of the things .
but more import@@ antly , i think , is the fact that a very significant propor@@ tion of people in this audience are under 30 , and there are many , of course , who are well over 30 .
time magazine asked americans , &quot; are you in the top one percent of ear@@ ners ? &quot;
so this is how the system works .
but we don &apos;t need to let it .
so i &apos;m going to show you one that can be run on a des@@ k@@ top in two days in the next picture .
but to a fashi@@ on@@ ist@@ a , what it really is is a sig@@ n of pra@@ da &apos;s genius : that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one j@@ ack@@ et that doesn &apos;t need to be changed by one i@@ ot@@ a , and to be current and to be now .
&quot; go for it , brother . &quot;
pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fis@@ si@@ le material is , and we can move toward zero weap@@ ons left , once we know all that .
and i call it , &quot; david and go@@ li@@ ath . &quot;
we can reach them . there are pa@@ ths that en@@ able us to reach them .

and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual pla@@ stic@@ ity .
and if you &apos;re wondering how much 16@@ k is , this e@@ bay logo here is 16@@ k .

gol@@ die ha@@ wn says , &quot; i always had self-@@ dou@@ b@@ ts .

the me@@ th@@ od we illu@@ strate in this video uses a pre@@ -@@ made vide@@ o@@ dis@@ c but creates cust@@ om hyper@@ card stac@@ ks .
it &apos;s ok to remember to forget , or forget to remember what happened .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
there are 10,000 species of ants that tax@@ on@@ om@@ ists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named .
and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analy@@ ze a bunch of brains of psychop@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers .
so it &apos;s not a kind of sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , quite the re@@ verse .
there are no sh@@ iny brid@@ ges .
gol@@ d@@ fish swa@@ m .
but most people , when you stop to ask them , will ad@@ mit to h@@ arb@@ oring a strange sort of f@@ on@@ dness for clou@@ ds .
this has come &apos; ro@@ und to be that all those na@@ ked pa@@ ch@@ y@@ der@@ ms have aqu@@ a@@ tic an@@ ce@@ stors .
he went with his friends in front of every russi@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy in europe and stood there with the photos to say , &quot; we have rights . &quot;
in san ra@@ mon , california , they published an i@@ phone app in which they allow you or me to say we are cer@@ ti@@ fied c@@ pr@@ -@@ trained , and then when someone has a heart attack , a no@@ ti@@ fication goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver c@@ p@@ r .
the effect of el si@@ ste@@ ma is felt in three fundamental cir@@ cles : in the personal / social circle , in the family circle and in the community .
we &apos;ve made a fascinating dis@@ covery : there &apos;s nothing wrong with the kids that affe@@ ction and s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine and food and enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m and her@@ b@@ ie &apos;s music can &apos;t cure .
and the last slide i want to show you is from -- i was -- again , this sw@@ ami that i studied with for so many years , and i did a combined on@@ c@@ ology and car@@ di@@ ology grand ro@@ unds at the university of virginia medical school a couple of years ago .
you don &apos;t necessarily have to win , but you must do extremely well .

100 percent of the cor@@ al may be wi@@ ped out before 20@@ 50 because of global war@@ ming .
&quot; well , in order to re@@ produce . &quot;
because we will throw away these political do@@ g@@ mas .
it &apos;s important , but not enough .
i &apos;ll be honest with you : we &apos;re into it because of business growth opportunities .
months after he was born , in 194@@ 8 , r@@ on mc@@ call@@ um became blind . in this char@@ ming , moving talk , he shows how he is able to read -- and cele@@ br@@ ates the pro@@ gr@@ ession of cle@@ ver tools and adap@@ tive computer technologies that make it possible . with their help , and that of gener@@ ous volunte@@ ers , he &apos;s become a law@@ yer , an academic , and , most of all , a vor@@ aci@@ ous rea@@ der . wel@@ come to the blind reading revolution .

now is there any alternative to this ?
they &apos;re hard to just get auto@@ matically .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
both myself and my brother bel@@ ong to the under 30 demo@@ graphic , which p@@ at said makes 70 percent , but according to our statistics it makes 60 percent of the region &apos;s population .
and that &apos;s a much bigger project ; it &apos;s going to take 20 years or so to come to fru@@ i@@ tion .
i think it &apos;s a hop@@ eless goal . technologi@@ cally , it &apos;s achiev@@ able ; econom@@ ically , it &apos;s achiev@@ able ; poli@@ tically , it means sort of the hab@@ its , institutions of people -- it &apos;s impossible .
whether the same thing is true in ad@@ h@@ d in humans we don &apos;t know , but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility .
&quot; no . it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
ok , this isn &apos;t exactly hard@@ ball . ok .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
you acqui@@ re the relationship with the company .
and this is probably something i &apos;m going to share with you in western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es -- thinking of yemen in one single frame : this is what yemen is all about .
it doesn &apos;t anima@@ te them .
and somehow , through some dynamic effect , we &apos;re having these ge@@ y@@ s@@ ers which are being , you know , em@@ it@@ ted from it .
signifi@@ can@@ ce in life doesn &apos;t come from status , because you can always find somebody who &apos;s got more than you .
sa@@ dly , he died in a light plane cr@@ ash in 200@@ 5 , but his memory lives on in my heart .
why ? because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job .
and so , pr@@ an@@ av turns the page of the book and can then see addi@@ tional information about the book -- rea@@ der comm@@ ents , maybe sort of information by his favorite cri@@ tic , etc .

it &apos;s a company that microsoft acqui@@ red some years ago .
in other words , i had dr@@ unk our great cultural ko@@ ol@@ -@@ aid about regret , which is that lam@@ enting things that occur@@ red in the past is an absolute waste of time , that we should always look forward and not back@@ ward , and that one of the no@@ bl@@ est and best things we can do is stri@@ ve to live a life free of regre@@ ts .
so , in fact at this point there are only 200 bre@@ eding gh@@ ari@@ al left in the wild .
kab@@ ir , ra@@ him , all the great su@@ f@@ i sa@@ in@@ ts , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason .
but what you see here is the result of , actually , inter@@ n@@ ships that we ho@@ sted with lin@@ kop@@ ing university in swe@@ den .
thank you . i had one big problem .
so , when we look at the pattern , one thing comes out very clearly : you see the blue bubbles and people say hiv is very high in africa .
what is that ? can you do that again ? can you show me some more ? &apos; &quot; she did that for two months .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price vari@@ ation .
it &apos;s called universe : re@@ ve@@ aling our modern myth@@ ology .
you happy people that have a lot of hair on your head , if you take a sho@@ wer , it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don &apos;t use a dr@@ yer machine .
here i &apos;m really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another .
bf : i thought i had the hard part . ok .
viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
the blind man said , &quot; look , i &apos;m a very strong man but i can &apos;t see . &quot;
she created the s@@ wis@@ s people named the u@@ v@@ uli@@ tes , and they have this dist@@ in@@ ctive yo@@ d@@ eling song that they use the u@@ vul@@ a for .
we think of a bunch of red@@ ne@@ cks , quote , un@@ quote , with guns .
you build plat@@ forms for self-@@ expression and collaboration .
in the 199@@ 0s , we saw financial centers around the world comp@@ eting for their business , and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money la@@ under@@ ing .
how can you make ha@@ ik@@ u po@@ em@@ s so beautiful so easily ? &quot;
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
they should consci@@ ously recognize that they &apos;ve built an ap@@ poin@@ tment dynamic and lever@@ age the games .

when i spo@@ ke at ted in 199@@ 6 , repor@@ ting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , &quot; those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-@@ refle@@ ction . &quot;
a water bottle : you buy it because of the bottle , not because of the water .
that &apos;s an e@@ yel@@ ash under a trillion dollars .
thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here .
i want you to say , or i want you to con@@ vey , that you are going to die if you have to , with your very last bre@@ ath , with your fing@@ er@@ na@@ ils scrat@@ ching as they dra@@ g you out .
and you may have more or less neurons .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
our first game is called &quot; photo gra@@ b . &quot; the game takes about a minute and 20 seconds .
now let me give you an example from my act .
and the building is no longer seen as an auton@@ om@@ ous thing , but something that &apos;s only in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably connected to this city and this place at this time .
thank you very much .
i think that &apos;s the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
es@@ sex only pa@@ ys in the event that it &apos;s saving them care costs .
he really was not inten@@ ding to work in patent research , but he couldn &apos;t really find an alternative technical job .
in the game that we created , of course , you control the woo@@ den form that &apos;s on the screen there with your mind .
has it done any good ?
other bir@@ ds , like this tan@@ a@@ ger , have adap@@ ted within the same species .
i &apos;ve had some great me@@ als at caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as .

we &apos;re seeing sc@@ a@@ ven@@ ged terr@@ a cot@@ ta tile and little pieces of signs , and pla@@ ster over the bri@@ ck , some color , and this is su@@ lay mon@@ ta@@ ka@@ ya &apos;s house in su@@ l@@ tan@@ bel@@ y@@ i , and it &apos;s getting even better .
the good news is that , with a little bit of hab@@ it@@ at re@@ stor@@ ation and fewer fli@@ ghts , the fro@@ g popul@@ ations , once di@@ min@@ ishing during the 198@@ 0s and early &apos; 9@@ 0s , have pretty much re@@ turned to normal .
and this is cran@@ bro@@ ok . i &apos;ve got a real treat for you , which is the first film that charles ever made .
but that &apos;s not the good life .
in time , all of science will come to be a continu@@ um of descri@@ ption , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
so , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a lingu@@ istic script and it acts like a lingu@@ istic script , then perhaps we may have a lingu@@ istic script on our hands .
in financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you ear@@ n , going further into de@@ bt every year .
cro@@ ws have become highly sk@@ ill@@ ed at making a living in these new urban environ@@ ments .
and they had a look at what was in the sou@@ p , and they found am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds , but nothing came out , there was no cell .

but i do think that perhaps design is getting big again .
you know , they &apos;ll res@@ ist that compar@@ is@@ on and that &apos;s natural , that &apos;s human .
some things are certain , i think .
you have the cru@@ de oil .
now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults .
so this strategy has served it pretty well -- it &apos;s 2,@@ 400 years old .
the most perfect examples occup@@ y corner lots .
that &apos;s the current business model .
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us ho@@ stage to this man box .
there &apos;s a very simple fluid to begin with .
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minim@@ ize the negative con@@ sequence of the noise .
indeed , we argu@@ e , there is no sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for wisdom .
it &apos;s a history of invention based around this .
so here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently : di@@ vor@@ ce , wi@@ -@@ f@@ i , toi@@ le@@ tries and coffee .

my name is joseph , a me@@ mber of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent in kenya .
we have to@@ k@@ yo coming in in japanese .
can you talk about that ?
same thing here : you had an intui@@ tive response to this that was very quick .
thank you .
well , let &apos;s play one . here . so , here is a very simple puzz@@ le .
his name is rob m@@ ce@@ wen .
japan has made an an@@ no@@ un@@ c@@ ement .
this is ted .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and touched the s@@ na@@ ke ended up having less anxi@@ ety about other things in their lives .
this perfect stor@@ m is moun@@ ting a gri@@ m reality , increasingly gri@@ m reality , and we are fac@@ ing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology , and that &apos;s very under@@ stand@@ able .
but kids , you can see these signs in them .
compare them to the tools our an@@ ce@@ stors used ; they bear a striking res@@ em@@ b@@ lan@@ ce to kan@@ z@@ i &apos;s .
think about how an individual respon@@ ds to a diagn@@ osis of a life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening ill@@ ness and how li@@ fest@@ yle changes that previ@@ ously were just too difficult suddenly become rela@@ tively easy .
fourth : rel@@ ations with ho@@ stil@@ es . mon@@ tan@@ ans have the same problems as do all americans , in being sensitive to problems created by ho@@ stil@@ es over@@ se@@ as aff@@ ecting our oil supp@@ lies , and terror@@ ist attacks . and finally , last it@@ em on my che@@ ck@@ list : question of how political , economic , social , cultural at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des play into this . mon@@ tan@@ ans have long-@@ held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .
and he said , &quot; she &apos;s telling me that i &apos;m mess@@ y , and i have to clean up my room . &quot;
instead of &quot; go anywhere , do anything you want , &quot; we actually created a regi@@ me that required pri@@ or ass@@ ess@@ ment of where you &apos;re going and a du@@ ty to prevent significant har@@ m .
once you think about it , you see this is not stati@@ st@@ ical points ; these are -- let &apos;s see , how far have i talked ?
it has its own ex@@ tern@@ al pros@@ the@@ tic devices , and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other .
and thro@@ wing is a combination of analy@@ tical and physical skill , so it &apos;s very good for that kind of who@@ le-@@ body training .
the micro@@ bi@@ al cloud , it is right in front of us .
every day he leaves the wire with a mission .
the only rule is don &apos;t think too hard .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t have a black card ; i &apos;ve got a de@@ bit card .
so the ideas can live on in spi@@ te of the fact that they &apos;re not being passed on gene@@ tically .
but a later response , and much more useful , would be to try and de@@ constru@@ ct the message behind the words , so when the voices war@@ ned me not to leave the house , then i would thank them for drawing my attention to how un@@ safe i felt -- because if i was aware of it , then i could do something positive about it -- but go on to reas@@ sure both them and myself that we were safe and didn &apos;t need to feel fri@@ gh@@ tened anymore .
we were actually introduced because we both knew lin@@ da a@@ vey , one of the fo@@ unders of the first online personal genom@@ ic companies .
researchers began to record what pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a said , by writing le@@ x@@ ig@@ ra@@ ms on the flo@@ or with ch@@ al@@ k .
when i call you and leave a message on your vo@@ ic@@ e@@ mail , i hear you saying , &quot; leave a message , &quot; and then i get these 15 seconds of fri@@ ck@@ in &apos; in@@ struc@@ tions , like we haven &apos;t had answer@@ ing machines for 45 years !
everything is affected . and we have to organize our response appropri@@ ately . we need a worldwide , global mo@@ bili@@ zation for ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , conservation , effi@@ ci@@ ency and a global transition to a low-@@ carbon economy .
so in our third year , how did we do it ?
really wan@@ ting to die .
i &apos;m mention@@ ing all this , i &apos;m mention@@ ing all this because i think this is not mer@@ ely a personal problem .
( text : such exam@@ in@@ ations allow us to improve eye@@ -@@ health in many children , and ...
anyway , he was really up@@ set on the plane , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ll never find another girl like sar@@ ah . &quot;
but before i do that , i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like pla@@ stics , which require huge amounts of energy to create and , because of their dis@@ pos@@ al issues , are slowly pois@@ oning our planet .
it &apos;s a big labor@@ -@@ inten@@ sive effort .
they &apos;re highly imag@@ in@@ ative .
so imagine the little 200@@ -@@ gra@@ m rat atta@@ ched at the extre@@ mit@@ y of this 200@@ -@@ kil@@ o robot , but the rat does not feel the robot .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooper@@ ating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
in fact , so many different points of reson@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
and in this case , a man got ho@@ o@@ ked on a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o sle@@ ep@@ ing m@@ at .
&quot; there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the po@@ sters we are recei@@ ving comes from schools .
why not a self-@@ fu@@ eling cycle in which we all can partici@@ pate ?
and there was about a thousand co@@ at han@@ gers that i &apos;d collected .
you can ask the question , &quot; who &apos;s the b@@ oss ? &quot;
the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are mo@@ dest .
sometimes we have to put cu@@ es around people to make it easier , and believe it or not , that can be studied scienti@@ fi@@ cally .
it &apos;s just like this one , completely worth@@ less , in which it alle@@ ge@@ dly worked by &quot; elec@@ tro@@ static magnetic ion attra@@ ction , &quot; which trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ d@@ osci@@ enti@@ fic bal@@ on@@ ey &quot; -- would be the nice word -- in which you str@@ ing together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing .
thank you .
i predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the super@@ markets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
who have been doing that ?
every morning you have te@@ a , as well as coffee .
and grand@@ parents are very important , because they are the trans@@ mit@@ ter of cultural evolution and information .
this is -- i don &apos;t know if you saw it on c@@ n@@ n recently -- they gave the heroes a@@ ward to a young ken@@ y@@ an she@@ pher@@ d boy who couldn &apos;t study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the ker@@ os@@ ene lam@@ p , it had smo@@ ke and it da@@ ma@@ ged his eyes .
in fact , these nam@@ es start coming up over and over again .
when i was a kid , i was a calcul@@ us whi@@ z .
right ? it wasn &apos;t your ability ; it was your state .
let me get you the fle@@ et of our waste collection trucks .
so we have this picture , which is quite a spectacular picture , and i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysteri@@ ous process that ki@@ cks the universe off at the beginning .
and that was what i did .
and it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing , again , lots in ri@@ o .
now what happened next with the game surprised me .
and as he had it , even the most re@@ st@@ less , di@@ stra@@ cti@@ ble , te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one-@@ ad@@ d@@ led 15@@ -year-old califor@@ ni@@ an boy only had to spend three days in sil@@ ence and something in him cool@@ ed down and clear@@ ed out .
when you go into spaces like this , you &apos;re directly ac@@ cess@@ ing the past , because they sit un@@ touched for decades .
i don &apos;t deserve it . i don &apos;t deserve anything .
i asked her why her side makes such ou@@ trage@@ ous alle@@ ga@@ tions and lies about my side .
this is no longer me being a tech pion@@ e@@ er or a priv@@ acy adv@@ oc@@ ate ; this is me being a par@@ ent .
but really , where are those bir@@ ds going to get rele@@ ased to ?
they had to be very c@@ auti@@ ous .
we &apos;re enter@@ ing a second generation of no progress in terms of human f@@ light in space . in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ gr@@ ess@@ ed .
this is 50 tsun@@ am@@ is sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed on the cal@@ end@@ ar , but somehow we can &apos;t sort of mar@@ sha@@ l our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it . we &apos;ll wait until it &apos;s more of a cat@@ astrop@@ he , and re@@ act , as opposed to pre@@ p@@ are for it .
and mexico re@@ ma@@ ins one of the largest gra@@ in im@@ por@@ ters on the planet because it doesn &apos;t apply technology that was discovered in mexico . and in fact , hasn &apos;t recogni@@ zed this man , to the point where there aren &apos;t stat@@ ues of this man all over mexico . there are in china and india . and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india . that is the difference between adop@@ ting technologies and discus@@ sing technologies .
it &apos;s learning skills -- like being in a high-@@ speed car cr@@ ash .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at .
i don &apos;t really look that ug@@ ly , but the camera is so close that it &apos;s just di@@ stor@@ ted .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
so , now you don &apos;t know where the spi@@ ke is , and i don &apos;t know where it is either , ok .
mos@@ es ! -- the boys in michael mor@@ pur@@ go &apos;s &quot; friend or fo@@ e ; &quot; al@@ em in ben@@ jam@@ in ze@@ ph@@ ani@@ ah &apos;s &quot; re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e boy ; &quot; lu@@ ke sky@@ walker -- lu@@ ke sky@@ walker ! -- oliver twi@@ st ; cas@@ si@@ a in &quot; the con@@ cu@@ bine of shanghai &quot; by h@@ ong ying ; cel@@ ie in ali@@ ce walker &apos;s &quot; the color pur@@ ple . &quot;
somebody said , &quot; you have to listen to this . &quot;
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world , and then see what the con@@ stell@@ ations of those might look like .
i &apos;m not going to hurt you . don &apos;t worry .
if you look at the solar system , as we know it today , it has a few planets close to the sun . that &apos;s where we live .
so that &apos;s a large number .
what do you do ?
but if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty , talking about the human brain .
the err@@ ors we make are actually predi@@ ct@@ able .
he just knows how to run a company .
this is called &quot; da@@ wn to da@@ wn . &quot;
no , these legs are great .
and this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply sa@@ tis@@ fying to me .
and then he has to go even further .
can we put your@@ s online ? &quot; and i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
what is it that they &apos;re happy with ?
i think there &apos;s more memory in my watch .
but i didn &apos;t say these things to abed .
and this is what every student has to begin with .
now , we &apos;re going to do other po@@ em@@ s for you , and here &apos;s a pre@@ view of some of the po@@ ets .
i went down to a remote la@@ go@@ on in australi@@ a , hop@@ ing to see the earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue .
if this book were to be published by a regular publi@@ sh@@ er , it would cost at least 12@@ 2 dollars .
and the reason was because of over@@ fis@@ hing , and the fact that a last common gra@@ zer , a sea ur@@ ch@@ in , died .
but we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to interact with it .
so the internet is as if someone would have given free plane ti@@ ckets to all the online cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
you &apos;re pe@@ e@@ king .
the largest organis@@ m on the planet is a my@@ ce@@ li@@ al m@@ at , one cell wall th@@ ick .
and when i went to college at the university of ne@@ v@@ ada , las vegas when i was 18 , i was stun@@ ned to find that there was not a pop star 10@@ 1 , or even a degree program for that interest .
how many problems of life can be solved actually by tin@@ ker@@ ing with perception , rather than that te@@ di@@ ous , hard@@ working and mess@@ y business of actually trying to change reality ?
the other problem that people have is they like to con@@ den@@ se their stories of innovation down to kind of shor@@ ter time fra@@ mes .
it was ridiculous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my cre@@ d@@ it history didn &apos;t travel with me .
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
s@@ k : absolutely . and this is something that i recom@@ mend everyone in this audience to do .
there &apos;s no mal@@ evol@@ ence , they &apos;re just pres@@ sing a butt@@ on .
when a squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l che@@ wed through a c@@ able and kno@@ cked him off@@ line , journalist andrew bl@@ um started wondering what the internet was really made of . so he set out to go see it -- the underwater c@@ ables , secret swi@@ t@@ ches and other physical bits that make up the net .
so i said to myself , i &apos;m an engineer , i &apos;m in r and d , this is just a pl@@ um@@ bing problem .
one of the most interesting re@@ vel@@ ations came not from an answer to a question , but from a simple gest@@ ure of hosp@@ it@@ ality .
here we go . once again the usa is part of the reason here .
wel@@ come to democracy , our tun@@ isi@@ an and egyp@@ ti@@ an friends .
but those kids are the kids who are now putting pump@@ k@@ in pat@@ ches on top of tra@@ ins .
oh , i know when your gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s really pis@@ sed off , even though she appe@@ ars to give you what you want .
this is a difficult , un@@ stable bin@@ ary .
so what did i do ?
how much money can i save ?
no easily im@@ ple@@ mented change could make that ti@@ lt cause the same seas@@ ons in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es .
audience : sb : mm@@ m mm@@ m .
when i heard the amazing talk by sal@@ man k@@ han on we@@ dn@@ es@@ day , about the k@@ han acade@@ my website that teach@@ es hundreds of subje@@ cts to students all over the world , i had a f@@ las@@ h@@ back .
gravi@@ ty is more powerful where there &apos;s more stuff .
and it &apos;s been used most fam@@ ously in ha@@ it@@ i in the after@@ math of the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke .
and it just keeps going . and the wind , the nor@@ the@@ ast wind s@@ wo@@ os@@ h@@ es it around and car@@ ries it off across the ocean to africa , where it &apos;s ra@@ ining .
okay , glass , record a video .
we built this institution based on social justice , gender equ@@ ity , this idea of em@@ power@@ ing women .
a friend of mine was a designer at i@@ ke@@ a , and he was asked by his b@@ oss to help design a stor@@ age system for children .
it can be done .
con@@ tra@@ cep@@ tives , cos@@ me@@ tics and brain re@@ progra@@ mm@@ ing techni@@ qu@@ es -- that sounds om@@ in@@ ous , but the dist@@ in@@ ction between what is a technology -- a g@@ ad@@ get would be the arch@@ et@@ yp@@ e -- and other ways of changing and re@@ writing human nature is quite subtle .
well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the mon@@ keys a financial currency , and they do very similar things with it .
but a sub@@ set of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
let me show you one more .
that &apos;s physical activity .
here it is in an end stage con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation .
but it took 2@@ 3 years to get this far . that &apos;s too long .
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy po@@ sts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what &apos;s called las@@ er scan@@ ning micro@@ dis@@ section .
i recently spo@@ ke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that niger@@ ian men were physical ab@@ us@@ ers like the father character in my novel .
if given the truth , they can be depen@@ ded upon to meet any national crisis .
in india , only 25 percent of rap@@ es come to a police station , and of these 25 percent that come to a police station , con@@ vi@@ ctions are only in four percent of the cases .
there i am like a bloo@@ dy wind@@ m@@ ill again , you see .
patri@@ ce and pat@@ ee have been out for hours but found nothing .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsi@@ di@@ ze the price of the car , just like c@@ ell@@ phones . you &apos;ll pay for the miles .
skelet@@ ons are ubi@@ quit@@ ous ; they &apos;re found all over the place .
but then comes the ask .
and you &apos;ll say stop , anywhere . got it ?
and 70 percent of this new labor force were previ@@ ously un@@ emplo@@ yed or under@@ emplo@@ yed .
laptops are a lu@@ x@@ ury ; it &apos;s like giving them ipo@@ ds . no .
so as you can see here , this is a , el@@ ev@@ en-@@ in@@ ch diam@@ eter circu@@ it board .
t@@ d : but it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and enter@@ tain@@ ing , as i thought it would have been .
they use it sy@@ ne@@ c@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were du@@ mp@@ ed there that are now becoming air@@ bor@@ ne .
let me give you a little pe@@ ek here of the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ land@@ s-@@ protected area .
it addres@@ ses one of the biggest health issues on the planet , the number one cause of death in children under five , which is ... ? wat@@ er-@@ bor@@ ne diseases ? di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a ? mal@@ nutrition ?
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
not the car@@ d@@ board box , but the green screen .
do they understand that as well as the chim@@ ps , for example ?
these fil@@ ms held what was too hur@@ t@@ ful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the wh@@ is@@ pers of survi@@ vors and the occas@@ i@@ onal gli@@ mp@@ se of a tattoo on a ma@@ i@@ den a@@ unt &apos;s wr@@ ist .
so , the as@@ sign@@ ment i &apos;ve been given may be an in@@ super@@ able obstac@@ le for me , but i &apos;m certainly going to try .
now , the thing is , the visual thin@@ ker &apos;s just one kind of mind .
when i was 12 years old , i was one of the first few people in singap@@ ore who under@@ went co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plan@@ tation .
why don &apos;t you rest for a few minutes and then we &apos;ll go on . &quot;
audience : oc@@ tober . oc@@ tober what ?
this stuff is everywhere .
i &apos;m going to give you my favorite scen@@ ari@@ o .
i &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
it &apos;s something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times .
jeff haw@@ kins , this morning , was descri@@ bing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
i &apos;m sure many people here have heard about pro@@ bio@@ tics .
imagine that you &apos;re going to the theater .
it &apos;s a great story . it &apos;s story we all know .
to answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the sp@@ inner@@ et region of a spider .
now if bill clinton had said , &quot; well , to tell you the truth ... &quot; or richard ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s favorite , &quot; in all cand@@ or ... &quot; he would have been a dead gi@@ ve@@ away for any li@@ es@@ pot@@ ter than knows that quali@@ fying language , as it &apos;s called , quali@@ fying language like that , further dis@@ cre@@ di@@ ts the subject .
so anyone who &apos;s gotten their pas@@ sport in america will tell you , when you get your pas@@ sport , it still says what country you were born in .
now this attra@@ ction to objects doesn &apos;t just work for cele@@ bri@@ ty objects .
and they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; is he serious ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ ements are about , what matters is that the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es are willing and able to stand up to authority .
and li@@ mor designed this , in part , because , like caro@@ l , she felt threat@@ ened by gps tra@@ cking .
i &apos;ve got a co@@ ke can opening that &apos;s right in your head ; that &apos;s really cool .
&#91; in the &#93; 20th century , we gave gandhi to the world .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
and her answer sho@@ cked me . it stun@@ ned me .
here &apos;s the dilemma ...
so , what &apos;s unique about the site is that it &apos;s anony@@ mous , and it has no memory .
and i called him lu@@ ca , which means &quot; the br@@ inger of light , &quot; because he does bring light to my life .
vis@@ hn@@ a was a 4@@ -year-old boy when i met him who was born in a cam@@ bo@@ dian prison in k@@ and@@ al pro@@ vin@@ ce . but because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the gu@@ ards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
when he was threat@@ ened by the th@@ u@@ gs of the ar@@ gent@@ ine military jun@@ ta , he came back and said , &quot; oh , come on , how else can you thre@@ aten , other than with death ? &quot;
on the other hand , i had played the vi@@ oli@@ n my entire life .
you think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there .
we have to stop that .
so , now a fal@@ se count .
and rather than go into statistics and trends , and tell you about all the orchestr@@ as that are clos@@ ing , and the record companies that are fol@@ ding , i thought we should do an experiment tonight -- an experiment .
i said , &quot; really . we have to show the other clas@@ ses how to do it , so when we walk down the hall , people will notice us , so you can &apos;t make noise .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cu@@ red , but by the diseases pre@@ v@@ ented .
this is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too excited about writing .
and it really helps me to understand how we see , how we hear , how we brea@@ the , how our brain can infor@@ m or mis@@ lead us .
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai .
i love to do synthetic biology .
but indeed , the laws of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics can be written down on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in , and yet they go@@ ver@@ n all of chemi@@ stry , all of life , all of history .
and when the experts in the u.@@ n .
you can &apos;t nu@@ mb those hard feel@@ ings without nu@@ mb@@ ing the other affects , our emotions .
and the last story i &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
and there &apos;s something nice about sli@@ des getting stuck .
and i also made a game about the tra@@ il of tears .
and so in stri@@ ct happ@@ y-@@ planet metho@@ d@@ ology , we &apos;ve become less efficient at turning our ultimate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to .
my brother had a picture of it . it is really ...
we can &apos;t solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans , but if we don &apos;t understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly than we do now , then the stres@@ ses that we will face , and that co@@ dy will face , and even nan@@ cy , who &apos;s going to live till she &apos;s 9@@ 8 , will have really problems cop@@ ing .
another way is to try to find a general anti@@ do@@ te to all emotions , and that &apos;s by looking at the very nature .
kb : look at the road , look at the road .
so , i always teach my kids to respect american ideas , but i told my daughter that this is one ex@@ ception -- -- that she is not ga@@ y , she is just con@@ f@@ used by this american problem .
that &apos;s 50@@ 0,000 more words . so that &apos;s a lot .
and they are so excited . that &apos;s the first board off the line .
you &apos;re going to find out why in a minute , because when i went to see ei@@ le@@ en , this is what i said i wanted to build .
and they would ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably end up in what i thought was a very bi@@ zar@@ re place , which is ways the world could end very suddenly .
because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fra@@ gi@@ le-@@ looking world just hanging against the black@@ ness of space .
and the next behavior i &apos;ll show you of this animal just stun@@ ned us the first time that we saw it .
we &apos;ve created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self .
now , when i talk about this with my friends in cambridge and si@@ lic@@ on valley , they say , &quot; fantastic . no more dru@@ d@@ gery , no more to@@ il .
bli@@ me@@ y .
and when people draw diagra@@ ms of version control systems , the diagra@@ ms always look something like this .
clean soil is a critical problem -- the ni@@ tri@@ fication , the dead zones in the gulf of mexico .
and after i came out of the clos@@ et , when she continued to say it , it made me fu@@ ri@@ ous .
let &apos;s look at this in greater detail .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with immen@@ se exc@@ it@@ ement to it being turned on .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the pri@@ mary ven@@ ues for music .
it would be very nice for me if it happened soon .
and this is something that we &apos;ve been resear@@ ching for a little while .
and four months later , the adop@@ tion pap@@ ers came through .
john mc@@ ca@@ in .
and that was really cool .
and i s@@ nu@@ ck out behind , and there was a mo@@ at , a f@@ ence and a field of co@@ ws .
and we got so over@@ he@@ ated in the ch@@ ase that we had to take off that fu@@ r co@@ at and throw it away .
the last step , of course , is app@@ li@@ cation .
what an achiev@@ ement that is .
now priv@@ acy issues asi@@ de , the other really interesting issue i &apos;m looking at is how do we em@@ power digital g@@ ho@@ sts , people &#91; who &#93; for whatever reason , are not active online , but are some of the most tru@@ st@@ worthy people in the world ?
there &apos;s also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
and over time -- quite rapidly actually , in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product , ready to take out of the machine and use .
since we took these first steps , the field of op@@ to@@ genetics has explo@@ ded .
so this is a very r@@ ough attempt to think out loud .
it &apos;s in his book &quot; the four lo@@ ves . &quot;
they didn &apos;t talk about vulner@@ ability being comfortable , nor did they really talk about it being exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating -- as i had heard it earlier in the shame intervie@@ wing .
and the way this happens is through the phenomenon of per@@ si@@ st@@ ence of vision .
it is extremely important , and once again , phosph@@ or@@ us is a key player .
now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; wrong &quot; in bo@@ ston or pal@@ o al@@ to , who are we to say that the proud den@@ i@@ zens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and dau@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ oth ba@@ gs ?
it &apos;s a little bit like the days when we all had be@@ at@@ les al@@ bu@@ ms or e@@ a@@ gles al@@ bu@@ ms and we &apos;d make a copy of that on a cas@@ se@@ tte tape , and let our friends copy that cas@@ se@@ tte tape , and pretty soon , with suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve generations that tape sounds like g@@ arb@@ age .
so , imagine taking all the world &apos;s books .
but it turns out that in 19@@ 18 that was not the case at all .
this game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn &apos;t just influence our behavior , it &apos;s influ@@ enced our entire culture .
and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identi@@ fication .
but i know it &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
marsh@@ all m@@ clu@@ han : if the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad , then it &apos;s happy . it &apos;s like the old qui@@ z shows .
this im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant student is the first one in his family to use an at@@ m .
your mind can handle 15@@ ,000 decisions a second . &quot;
well , that &apos;s the future we have to look forward to .
el@@ on , what kind of crazy dream would per@@ su@@ ade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all-@@ electric car ?
good job . good job .
now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
for@@ ty cru@@ cial questions .
we are on the ver@@ ge of the greatest expl@@ or@@ ation that the human race has ever known .
i have my entire new york city board of education tran@@ script from kinder@@ garten through college .
if i can ask an in@@ dis@@ cre@@ et question , how many of you have tat@@ to@@ os ?
is it a min@@ or problem , with something simple i can fi@@ x ?
i decided to face the challenge , and on that same night , i promised those 11 children i &apos;d turn our orchestr@@ a into one of the leading orchestr@@ as in the world .
we &apos;ve taught well over 200@@ ,000 af@@ gh@@ an security forces to read and write at a basic level .
except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too , and they &apos;re respon@@ ding to what they think the vot@@ ers want .
we have two pieces of ob@@ serva@@ tional evidence on the prob@@ ability of life appe@@ aring .
that &apos;s the difference .
which was com@@ for@@ ting , but trou@@ bling .
there will be no excep@@ tions to that .
that &apos;s just the united states .
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pen@@ etr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
so people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignor@@ e it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around .
that &apos;s my father .
i think you need a pil@@ ot in the plane that can talk to the universi@@ ties , that can talk to students , talk to politicians during the f@@ light , and really make it a human advent@@ ure .
when you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
the answer , i believe , is yes .
we went back to our hotel room , and gene was showing nat@@ ash@@ a also where atlan@@ ta was .
why is that ?
to do that -- this is an early example of the technology .
that &apos;s why you have toilet humor and sexual humor .
un@@ aids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
and there are different kinds of relationships between the people .
and i had finally got around to doing some dra@@ ft stri@@ pping , install@@ ing insu@@ lation around the windows and doors to keep out the dra@@ f@@ ts .
and we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
of course if you want to go inside , the two doors are locked .
it &apos;s very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern .
dis@@ clos@@ ure is so important to treatment , because again , people need the support of family members and friends to take their medi@@ cin@@ es reg@@ ularly .
so i wanted to show you some of the i@@ ter@@ ations we did between the first version , the ja@@ i@@ pu@@ r k@@ ne@@ e , so this is it right here .
urban@@ i@@ zation , integration , coming together , leads to a new ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance .
he believed that there were 70 basic pos@@ es or shapes of the human face , and that those basic pos@@ es or shapes of the face can be combined to create infin@@ ite possi@@ bilities of everything the human face is cap@@ able of doing .
we can make it better .
or would they believe in the black , static emp@@ ty universe that their own state-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art ob@@ serva@@ tions re@@ ve@@ al ?
so co@@ ws are dying , and co@@ ws are the most valu@@ ed pos@@ s@@ ession .
we start with s@@ her@@ man in a chinese restaurant , who gets a fortun@@ e that he &apos;s about to get cau@@ ght by a tra@@ w@@ ler , which he does .
if you ask for help , you get more done . and we really need help .
how does life make the most of things ?
and john mor@@ ti@@ mer , the play@@ w@@ right , defen@@ ded us .
i think that the &quot; now tied up , tied down , mi@@ stress cru@@ el approach@@ es me , now tied down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
so , the approach that we started with is to ask : is it really practical to make things of this sort ?
when we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really , really good .
and this also happened to my girls as they began to see , and , we thought , maybe became an o@@ un@@ ce more com@@ passionate .
i consider myself the ti@@ de of sh@@ it .
this is the e@@ jac@@ ulation face of the st@@ ump@@ -@@ ta@@ iled ma@@ ca@@ que .
i was making a series of six games that covered difficult top@@ ics , and if you &apos;re going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and i &apos;ll let you figure out what that &apos;s about on your own .
i &apos;m saying , where do they go when they &apos;re like me ?
you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestr@@ a and in the audience .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
and the last was they had connection , and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of auth@@ en@@ ticity , they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were , which you have to absolutely do that for connection .
but i know tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess when i see it .
and we also use func@@ tional mri , called f@@ mri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when partici@@ pants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or per@@ cei@@ ving something .
he literally had nothing . he was a virtual skelet@@ on , yet he could still su@@ mm@@ on the courage and the will to move .

are we alone ? seti .
there is many different aspects to fre@@ e-@@ di@@ ving .
and that &apos;s what i want to talk about today .
this is cu@@ ev@@ a de v@@ illa lu@@ z in tab@@ as@@ co , in mexico , and this cave is satur@@ ated with su@@ l@@ fu@@ ric ac@@ id .
first of all , your pyramid , your in@@ ver@@ ted pyramid , showing 85 percent bio@@ mass in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that seems impossible .
what the actor does with this information depends on its policy , which is stor@@ ed in the streng@@ ths of the connection , between the od@@ or dete@@ ctors and the motors that power the fly &apos;s ev@@ asive actions .
it &apos;s not a min@@ ority theory .
a satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite .
so now i &apos;m like 50 yards from my arri@@ val and i &apos;m ex@@ hau@@ sted , so my steps are slow .
daniel tam@@ met has lingu@@ istic , nu@@ mer@@ ical and visual syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia -- meaning that his perception of words , numbers and colors are wo@@ ven together into a new way of per@@ cei@@ ving and understanding the world . the author of &quot; born on a blue day , &quot; tam@@ met shares his art and his passion for languages in this gli@@ mp@@ se into his beautiful mind .
and in the inter@@ ven@@ ing years i had two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
but it &apos;s not only numbers that i see in colors .
so i went to find out . i did some research and discovered , we have no idea who she is .
in fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
because the off@@ ices are well equi@@ pped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
and all of the rest .
and back home , what do you see ?
well what i learned is wh@@ en@@ ever tem@@ pers rise in those communities , someone goes and hi@@ des the poison arro@@ ws out in the bush , and then everyone si@@ ts around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk .
and occas@@ ion@@ ally , there are dis@@ ast@@ ers .
mal@@ ware is very bor@@ ing otherwise .
in investig@@ ating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to un@@ cover deep tru@@ ths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
i found out that advan@@ ces in science rar@@ ely come up@@ stream from an ability to stand at a black@@ board and con@@ j@@ ure images from un@@ fol@@ ding mathema@@ tical pro@@ posi@@ tions and equ@@ ations .
the service respon@@ ded effec@@ tively and effi@@ ci@@ ently , during the un@@ fortun@@ ate 26 / 11 mumbai ter@@ ror attacks .
see , for instance , in this picture .
if , when ted had be@@ gun , at 11 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck on tu@@ es@@ day , we &apos;d walked out and simply hit one slide every second , it would have taken five hours to show you that number .
it &apos;s the gold standard .
and government has certain benefits it can uni@@ qu@@ ely be@@ sto@@ w on these markets .
the reason i show this -- not to put a dow@@ ner on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosoph@@ y of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
and hydro@@ gen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they &apos;re par@@ ked to generate electricity for the grid .
and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about ne@@ o-@@ na@@ z@@ is taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich .
for example , in israel , where we emplo@@ y more than 1@@ ,000 he@@ ct@@ ar@@ es -- 10,000 dun@@ ams in isra@@ el@@ i terms -- of biological p@@ est controll@@ ing sweet pe@@ pp@@ er under protection , 75 percent of the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des were actually redu@@ ced .
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .
now , conventional wisdom says , &quot; well , hey , our intellectual property bel@@ on@@ gs to us , and if someone tries to in@@ fr@@ inge it , we &apos;re going to get out our lawyers and we &apos;re going to sue them . &quot;
gu@@ ilt is &quot; i did something bad . &quot;
we can open up city hall .
do you want mil@@ o to squ@@ ash it ?
but hang on , this talk is to be about the good news .
there &apos;s this piece of wall in hir@@ os@@ hi@@ ma that was completely bur@@ nt black by the radiation .
and we ask the question , can we use technology , high technology , to make an exp@@ o pa@@ vili@@ on that &apos;s deci@@ de@@ dly low definition , that also challenges the conven@@ tions of space and skin , and re@@ thinks our dependence on vision ?
he has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the ra@@ f@@ ters with arti@@ facts docum@@ enting contemporary chinese history .
you directly ob@@ serve a few simple things .
they create a dish where all the ve@@ ctors point at us .
so vi@@ tam@@ in d is good for you -- it stop@@ s ri@@ ckets , it pre@@ v@@ ents cal@@ ci@@ um met@@ ab@@ oli@@ sm , important stuff .
let me tell you where i got it .
and he got them chan@@ ting by the end of the talk , &quot; ra@@ w data now .
now give us a pun@@ ish@@ ment . okay .
the skin itself is made out of a se@@ e-@@ through n@@ y@@ l@@ on mes@@ h , which , if the ligh@@ ting designer wants the hor@@ se to almost disappear , she can light the background and the hor@@ se becomes g@@ ho@@ st@@ like .
i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is off@@ ered .
it &apos;s around 19@@ 00 .
this is a beautiful project by r@@ alp@@ h bor@@ land , who &apos;s south african .
but i be@@ t there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don &apos;t think about it very often at all .
he &apos;s number 7@@ 6 in the picture .
and the third thing : it &apos;s a symbol of his influence .
a 24@@ -year-old truck dri@@ ver .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
so i knew there were two cars with two lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ates on each .
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no re@@ ference to j@@ er@@ ry gar@@ ci@@ a .
there is very little 20th century technology in them .
she just answer@@ ed , &quot; they are contribu@@ ting to pay for your education hop@@ ing that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community . &quot;
and it was pretty extraordinary , way back then .
let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dis@@ pu@@ te about justice .
but actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14 .
in the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilo@@ gra@@ ms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilo@@ gra@@ ms per person per year .
dan g@@ il@@ bert , author of &quot; st@@ um@@ bling on happiness , &quot; challenges the idea that we &apos;ll be miser@@ able if we don &apos;t get what we want . our &quot; psych@@ ological imm@@ une system &quot; lets us feel truly happy even when things don &apos;t go as plan@@ ned .
the inclu@@ sion agen@@ da doesn &apos;t come from elections .
i &apos;ll pro@@ ve them wrong on both points .
no one believed it was done . everyone said , &quot; oh , what does nasa think ?
so when i did the calcul@@ ations for the lun@@ ar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the inci@@ dent of the sho@@ ot@@ ing , all right , it was well past the end of civil twi@@ light and there was no moon up that night .
but the challenge is changing society &apos;s perception of possibility , and it &apos;s a huge challenge .
if i really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
you move on .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
and so , in the end , the question of markets is not main@@ ly an economic question .
and this was 2007 .
in new york state , robert mos@@ es spe@@ ar@@ head@@ ed an aggressi@@ ve highway expansion campa@@ ign .
it &apos;s a gr@@ ass@@ roots campa@@ ign with 80 percent me@@ mber@@ ship being women , most of whom are hiv-@@ positive .
one in seven afri@@ c@@ ans is a niger@@ ian , and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in nigeria . and when mt@@ n came in , they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in the u.k. or in europe -- expensive mon@@ th@@ ly plan@@ s , you get a phone , you pay over@@ ages , you &apos;re killed with fe@@ es -- and their plan crash@@ ed and bur@@ ned .
everybody benefits from that -- those emplo@@ yed , of course , because they get a job and dig@@ nity .
so , with the steak , you might drink a be@@ er .
and the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left , 2@@ 3 came back , two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground .
how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i &apos;m trying to understand .
that was like the fi@@ bers of the cotton cand@@ y creating this structure , this tu@@ bul@@ ari@@ zed structure , which is a bio@@ material that we can then use to help your body re@@ generate using your very own cells to do so .
i think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most .
maybe it &apos;s important -- yeah -- nine of diam@@ onds , ok .
so we kept on going , and this cam@@ el kept on trying to take a ch@@ unk out of my leg .
de@@ bor@@ ah gor@@ don : the emer@@ gent genius of ant colon@@ ies

ok , so that &apos;s what we did , but how are we going to do that ?
j@@ ared fi@@ ck@@ lin : new ways to see music
now , think about your interactions with al@@ umin@@ um fo@@ il .
and for that sharing activity to happen , we have to have well-@@ protected spaces of fair use .
i think that the time is ri@@ p@@ e to make fundamental changes in our civilization .
and she told me last night , in the three months since we &apos;ve done it , we &apos;ve gotten 300 people who &apos;ve contribu@@ ted to this program .
heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
as an adver@@ tis@@ ing man , i have to ad@@ mi@@ re that .
that &apos;s the wrong answer .
david by@@ r@@ ne s@@ ings the talking heads &apos; 198@@ 8 hit , &quot; flo@@ wers . &quot; he &apos;s accomp@@ ani@@ ed by thomas dol@@ by and str@@ ing quar@@ tet e@@ the@@ l , who made up the ted@@ 20@@ 10 house band .
and in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
and he tells me , he has on his des@@ k a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a do@@ ve on my head .
should we be surprised when the whole thing free@@ zes up and des@@ c@@ ends into paraly@@ s@@ is and pol@@ ari@@ zation ?
we have no choice other than deep and urgent de@@ carbon@@ i@@ zation .
cy@@ rus sets up a model of how you run a great mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional , multi@@ fa@@ it@@ h , mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society .
in the beginning , maybe p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ples and be@@ ans and cor@@ n ; in the second phase , there will be ban@@ an@@ as and pap@@ ay@@ as ; later on , there will be cho@@ col@@ ate and ch@@ ili@@ es .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they du@@ pli@@ cated all my projects . that &apos;s the ge@@ ek side .
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .
now , we &apos;ve pus@@ h@@ ed the technology as far as it can go , but there &apos;s still less than a second of lat@@ ency , but in musical terms , that &apos;s a lifetime .
some people don &apos;t . and if we like them , we &apos;ve got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
this universe is descri@@ bed by being a network of relationships .
here you see it , next , going up the side of a building at stanford .
al@@ ph@@ a is the distribution of the si@@ zes of attacks , which is really the distribution of the group streng@@ th car@@ rying out the attacks .
and again , it &apos;s actually a re@@ lief for what &apos;s going on in china because i think on the table right now , there &apos;s 2@@ 7 nuclear power stations to be built .
so that was my work , and it was my way of rei@@ mag@@ ining the future for future research , with fig@@ uring out exactly what this protein does , but also for the future of chemo@@ therapy effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess -- so maybe all grand@@ fa@@ thers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grand@@ children .
another thing that helped me as a little kid is , boy , in the &apos; 5@@ 0s , you were taught man@@ ners .
it &apos;s not just one du@@ de making one poster , it &apos;s -- we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , &quot; make me a poster . pos@@ t it .
they &apos;re mostly financial institutions in the u.s. and the u.@@ k .
and sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to ac@@ cept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
now , i had two pre@@ conditions .
so let me show you , this is our esti@@ mates of how fast we could translate wikipedia from english into span@@ ish .
these instin@@ cts are essenti@@ al for survival in both real and virtual worl@@ ds .
the universe was about 75 percent hydro@@ gen , 25 percent heli@@ um . it still is today .
now , since this is ted@@ global , who can tell me what this is called in french ?
part of the ur@@ gency comes from the fact that , of order , a billion people on the planet currently are under@@ n@@ our@@ ished or star@@ ving .
in tribu@@ te and reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance of 26 / 11 attacks over the last one year , we have actually helped a pak@@ istan@@ i n@@ go , a@@ man foundation , to set up a self-@@ sustainable life support am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce service in kar@@ ach@@ i , facili@@ tated by ac@@ u@@ men fund .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
we see other examples of problems like this .
but i think this research shows that the british en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , or the scot@@ tish en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , with david hu@@ me , a@@ dam s@@ mit@@ h , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often we@@ ak , our senti@@ ments are strong , and our senti@@ ments are often tru@@ st@@ worthy .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s learning . okay ?
kt : god .
there are many promised lands , depen@@ ding on your station in society , depen@@ ding on your stage of life .
i mentioned a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an before .
the bo@@ w res@@ em@@ bles me , and i res@@ em@@ ble the bo@@ w .
we all ha@@ te moral ambigu@@ ity in some sense , and yet it is also absolutely necessary .
the past decade has seen slow and ste@@ ady economic growth across the continent of africa . but econom@@ ist charles ro@@ ber@@ t@@ son has a b@@ old thesis : africa &apos;s about to bo@@ om . he talks through a few of the indi@@ cat@@ ors -- from rising education levels to exp@@ anded global investment -- that lead him to predict rap@@ id growth for a billion people , sooner than you may think .
she &apos;s changed the rules .
in reality , it does not really make you sa@@ fer .
mission accomp@@ li@@ shed !
before i tell you why it isn &apos;t , i &apos;m going to go a little bit into what i &apos;m calling step two .
it &apos;s about energy emissions .
so window far@@ ms have been evol@@ ving through a rap@@ id ver@@ sion@@ ing process similar to software .
it is simply how we protect our walls .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
this is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their re@@ venue versus their age -- all zo@@ om@@ ing away , and everybody making millions and billions of dollars .
sound familiar ?
but i think the process , in itself , shows how ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te they are .
and if you he@@ f@@ ted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .
but then what was the answer of the regi@@ me ?
by buying a space that was 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . ft .
oh yes , no gun was ever found .
so i looked for quality information .
this expression , which is known as pri@@ de , j@@ essi@@ ca tra@@ cy has studied . she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
back inside , i asked my class@@ mates if they were having the same experience of words j@@ ump@@ ing around our cases as i was .
next step , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them , you know , in the lab at j@@ p@@ l , in what we call our mars y@@ ard .
and country 2 is china .
he r@@ ings the bell again . he says , &quot; we have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clo@@ ck -- &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together .
think of what that means .
why is twitter so successful ? because it op@@ ens up its plat@@ form .
well , i &apos;ve got news for you .
and i know all of you are scrat@@ ching your head : &quot; a sen@@ ior citizens &apos; home ? what in the world are you going to do there ? &quot;
ok , i make little robots in lab to make these chips , and i &apos;m really big on dis@@ semin@@ ating technology .
the energy crisis was in full bor@@ e .
now , a si@@ x-@@ mi@@ le-@@ wide rock is very large .
the i@@ patient is getting wonderful care all across america .
but they also have a ch@@ el@@ ating ag@@ ent in them .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cool@@ ing load by a third .
we realized that even rich kids from the sub@@ ur@@ bs really want dr@@ y@@ bat@@ h .
we &apos;d seen that us@@ ers had actually mo@@ di@@ fied it .
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .
and you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
we want to be able to build technological arti@@ facts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological arti@@ facts , like people and whales and trees .
women are ref@@ using to mar@@ ry men without toi@@ lets .
so i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to spend a year over here . &quot;
zip@@ car started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
would you kill for a pair of air j@@ or@@ dan@@ s ? le@@ mon ander@@ sen sp@@ ins a tale of someone who did , re@@ c@@ iting a po@@ em by re@@ g e. ga@@ ines . these ver@@ ses taught le@@ mon that po@@ etry could be about more than self-@@ expression , and could sound like music when given rhyth@@ m and inf@@ used with the gr@@ it of the new york streets around him .
pros@@ ecu@@ tors were perfectly trained .
there are lots of ways we have of avo@@ i@@ ding and nu@@ mb@@ ing and by@@ pas@@ sing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
per@@ u@@ vi@@ ans love japanese woo@@ d@@ block prin@@ ts .
and then we jump to von ne@@ um@@ ann , 19@@ 45 , when he sort of rein@@ v@@ ents the whole same thing .
if you can get it for 200 bucks , why pay a thousand ?

the gol@@ den rule is great . i &apos;m a big suppor@@ ter of both .
&quot; i think he &apos;s going to hi@@ j@@ ack the plane with some ice cre@@ am . &quot;
and designers would like , oh , i don &apos;t know how to do an equ@@ ation , i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying . and then all of a sudden they really started talking each others &apos; language , and now we &apos;re already at the point that they collabor@@ ate .
these are just some of the hou@@ se@@ holds that we &apos;ve done in the in@@ tel studies .
two of his wi@@ ves were brought to him suffering from in@@ ferti@@ li@@ ty and he cu@@ red them , three for evil spi@@ ri@@ ts , one for an asth@@ matic condition and sever@@ e ch@@ est pain and two wi@@ ves on@@ di@@ jo c@@ la@@ ims he took for love , paying their families a total of 16 co@@ ws .
the dog says , &quot; i don &apos;t think so . &quot;
now if we look at the economic imper@@ ative here , this isn &apos;t just about compassion .
and what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical mes@@ sen@@ gers within the body , we thought of complicated things like est@@ ro@@ gen and insu@@ lin , or ner@@ ve trans@@ mission .
and man , let me tell you , who@@ ever fig@@ ures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh , how did that get up there ? just ki@@ d@@ ding .
but let &apos;s take another animal just as an example . here &apos;s a mouse .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 3@@ 5 public l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have been recorded so far in 20@@ 10 in mexico .
okay . and actually of those hands , if you don &apos;t inclu@@ de ro@@ om@@ ba how many of you have a robot at home ?
it really is a fact that liber@@ als are much higher than conserva@@ tives on a major person@@ ality tra@@ it called open@@ ness to experience .
so i started doing that .
we would actually en@@ list them -- which we &apos;ve done now -- to collect spec@@ im@@ ens from animals .
because i feel an ur@@ gency about this .
and boy are we willing to f@@ ill in those g@@ aps in our lives with lies .
os@@ ari@@ o : well traffic tonight is fine .
so what it &apos;s telling you here is that obviously this auto@@ matic , sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ bing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique .
these tags have been engine@@ ered by a variety of teams in north america .
well , you still have choice .
and when you think of the fabri@@ c of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? what is the pattern of the car@@ pet ?
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; -- and she wonder@@ ed , like all parents who lose children wonder -- &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot;
a robot .
and it gets worse , i crash@@ ed it into your house .
what it really takes to do well , to lead a mean@@ ing@@ ful life , are things that are deep@@ er , things we don &apos;t really even have words for .
but with reg@@ ard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; i am an exper@@ t .
again , &quot; in@@ ward out . &quot;
that &apos;s all it is , but that &apos;s all that &apos;s needed because what it does is it takes the tac@@ it information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is , but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tac@@ it information and it ag@@ gre@@ gates it , and it maps it and it makes it public .
it &apos;s one of the largest in@@ tact her@@ ds in this part of africa .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; c@@ at &#93; .
it is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ fs and des@@ ires that reli@@ ably lead to need@@ less human suffering .
what is killing the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil ? a vir@@ ul@@ ent cancer is infe@@ cting them by the thousands -- and unlike most cancers , it &apos;s con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous . resear@@ cher eli@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th mur@@ ch@@ is@@ on tells us how she &apos;s fighting to save the ta@@ z , and what she &apos;s learning about all cancers from this un@@ usual stra@@ in . con@@ tains dist@@ ur@@ bing images of facial cancer .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thou@@ ghts and feel@@ ings even as we &apos;re having them .
now your hom@@ e@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to con@@ tem@@ plate what it means .
just ordinary pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , nothing special .
figure out some of the other op@@ tions that are much better . it &apos;s important .
and then god says , &quot; pick it up . &quot;
we &apos;ve clu@@ tter@@ ed ourselves up with all this .
and so , the day of the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed pro@@ cession , thousands of people showed up .
and then we decided , why not get to religion because in the phili@@ pp@@ ines , the ca@@ tho@@ lic church was pretty strong , and th@@ ai people were buddh@@ ist .
and now we designed them reas@@ on@@ ably well , but that &apos;s exactly why they are la@@ sting that long and still provi@@ ding all the science data .
they look -- maybe they look kind of pre@@ histor@@ ic and un@@ finished , ab@@ ri@@ d@@ ged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they v@@ ie for the top position of the most evolution@@ ar@@ il@@ y-@@ deri@@ ved fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .

as most of you know , she &apos;s a hero for democracy in her country , bur@@ ma .
this was done in japan and in the u.s. , published at the same time , and it re@@ bo@@ ot@@ ed skin cells into stem cells , last year .
so , even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this , really , we were inspired by biology and ap@@ pl@@ ying the principles of walking to this robot . th@@ us it &apos;s a bi@@ ologi@@ cally inspired robot .
and here &apos;s the truth : do@@ od@@ ling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-@@ learn .

this is all about self-@@ interest that ad@@ ds up to more .
ju@@ li@@ a b@@ ach@@ a : pay attention to non@@ violence
today i &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
he was in the na@@ tivity play .
and that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind , in my heart , and i do my best at finding ways to express them with materials , and it always fe@@ els really cru@@ de .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
so there is no mistake .
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna .
there had to be a better way .
it may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
you &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re bin@@ ding yourself , and you &apos;re we@@ as@@ eling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re be@@ ating yourself up after@@ wards .
every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell , and they &apos;re part of the fe@@ a@@ ther .
it &apos;s one project per year , and it makes the you@@ th the biggest as@@ set and the biggest un@@ t@@ apped resour@@ ce in imag@@ ining a new future .
so here &apos;s an example . i &apos;ll use a figure eight , tra@@ cing out a figure eight as an example .
which bac@@ ks up my point and shows he didn &apos;t even break a swe@@ at when he said that .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stor@@ ed with that speci@@ alized spring , but the extre@@ mes of the fluid dynam@@ ics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynam@@ ics as a second force for bre@@ aking the s@@ na@@ il .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fres@@ h perspective and see if i can optimi@@ ze it in its most ide@@ ali@@ stic fashion .
now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ holds where english isn &apos;t spo@@ ken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning dis@@ abilities . and of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed .
i believe this wish refle@@ cts a pain@@ ful truth that i &apos;ve learned in the past 15 years .
&quot; it &apos;s a glam@@ or@@ ous sha@@ de of pin@@ k . &quot;
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
and we currently have access to el@@ even language pa@@ irs .
the transition will cost in line with other small air@@ plan@@ es .
because i think they &apos;re looking at the west , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; well , we like that aspect of what you &apos;ve got , but we &apos;re not so sure about that . &quot;
and this is something that we &apos;re very excited about .
if i had a j@@ ar of j@@ ell@@ ybe@@ ans and i asked you all to guess how many j@@ ell@@ ybe@@ ans were in that j@@ ar , your average guess would be remark@@ ably good .
thank you .
and so they &apos;re holding off until they get a deal with them .
we do the same task with eleph@@ ants .
and that &apos;s the purpose of the universe ; and then it fl@@ at@@ -@@ lines , it doesn &apos;t get any better .
and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t i look at the news better ? &quot;
every child has the right to a family , deser@@ ves and needs a family , and children are amaz@@ ingly resili@@ ent .
it doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
we see it that way . plants are bus@@ y making long cha@@ ins of star@@ ches and gl@@ u@@ c@@ ose , right , out of co2 . he &apos;s found a way -- he &apos;s found a cat@@ aly@@ st -- and he &apos;s found a way to take co2 and make it into poly@@ carbon@@ ates . bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able pla@@ stics out of co2 -- how plan@@ t-@@ like .
i &apos;m only a level four , but i des@@ perat@@ ely want to be a level 10 , because they &apos;ve got that cool red bad@@ ge thing , and that means that i am somehow better than everyone else .
i &apos;d like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of , sort of , what we face . normally , we get asked a lot of questions : &quot; well , how do you find fossi@@ ls in areas that look like this ? &quot;
she made enough money , she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers , a company , everything , and she became my mana@@ ger .
there is one alternative that caro@@ l could have taken , very effective . it &apos;s called the wave bub@@ ble .
no 1@@ 0-@@ year-old goes to law school to do mer@@ gers and ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tions .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that &apos;s to produce adap@@ table and complex movements .
my first experi@@ ences , though , did come from cam@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time i remember first coming to cam@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the k@@ h@@ mer rou@@ ge had killed them all .
but i think to set the scene , i want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess .
why are those numbers so fin@@ ely tuned to allow stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recognize that if you fi@@ dd@@ le with those numbers -- if i had 20 di@@ als up here and i let you come up and fi@@ dd@@ le with those numbers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe disappear .
simil@@ arly , the astronom@@ er royal , whom we heard speak yesterday , also has a 50 percent prob@@ ability estimate .
they also happen to be particularly ade@@ pt at working the international ta@@ x system so as to lower their ta@@ x bill very , very signific@@ antly .
essentially , his b@@ ones were rapidly buried and beauti@@ fully preser@@ ved .
it &apos;s 18@@ 7@@ 6 , it &apos;s in bo@@ ston , and this is alexander gra@@ ham bell who was working with thomas watson on the invention of the tele@@ phone .
jen@@ ny is hor@@ ri@@ fied at what she has done , but then the trans@@ l@@ ator expla@@ ins that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
there isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
and then we po@@ sted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .
so g@@ nee@@ zy and ru@@ sti@@ chin@@ i run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s it . all done ; fine . &quot;
it seems too da@@ un@@ ting , too dangerous , for any company to take on .
i just put this thing on my site and i &apos;m making 10,000 dollars a month .
unfortunately it &apos;s made against the current form of h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 .
and now their aspi@@ ration is not only to have a car .
so back in 199@@ 5 , i began to think about ways in which we could improve this process .
and we , all of us , have to understand that this is about us , that we can make a difference here .
it was also for@@ med in part by a be@@ a@@ ver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very de@@ lic@@ ate balance .
in terms of the shi@@ pping noise , the international mar@@ i@@ time organization of the united nations has for@@ med a group whose job is to establi@@ sh gu@@ i@@ del@@ ines for qui@@ eting ships , to tell the industry how you could quiet ships .
j@@ im@@ my , you mentioned im@@ parti@@ ality being a key to wikipedia &apos;s success .
bren@@ é brown studies human connection -- our ability to empath@@ ize , bel@@ ong , love . in a po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant , funny talk , she shares a deep insight from her research , one that sent her on a personal quest to know her@@ self as well as to understand humanity . a talk to share . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but as a si@@ del@@ ine , he happens to collect cor@@ nets .
everyone in your country has been touched by the violence , the bloo@@ d@@ shed , the pain , the hor@@ ror , everybody .

we went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from bos@@ nia was that elections held too early ens@@ hr@@ ined se@@ ct@@ arian violence , ens@@ hr@@ ined extrem@@ ist par@@ ties , so in iraq in 2003 the decision was made , let &apos;s not have elections for two years . let &apos;s invest in vot@@ er education . let &apos;s invest in democra@@ ti@@ zation .
except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case .
the other explanation is that she was gu@@ il@@ ty .
he saw that first gl@@ in@@ t of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
now what are some of the results ?
that &apos;s pretty much it .
but i don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
and so , since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself , i &apos;m going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intui@@ tions in action .
130 million people living in an area the size of wis@@ con@@ s@@ in -- people everywhere -- the poll@@ ution was inten@@ se , and the working conditions were hor@@ ri@@ ble .
what could i do ?
you know , the whole x@@ o laptop , from one laptop per child , is based on the idea of collaboration and mas@@ h and net@@ working .
islam is the majority religion all the way from the atlan@@ tic ocean across the middle east , southern europe and through asia all the way to in@@ don@@ es@@ ia .
if you co@@ ok food for p@@ ig@@ s , just as if you co@@ ok food for humans , it is ren@@ dered safe .
as you can see here , they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into plan@@ ar formation .
and we know that there will be more of us than ever before -- five times as many people in 40 years than 60 years ago .
but 10,000 men , of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9@@ ,000 plus about 600 were men .
i want to re@@ mind you again -- i know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
he said , &quot; listen , we &apos;re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree ?
wan@@ gar@@ i ma@@ ath@@ ai -- 2004 peace lau@@ re@@ ate .
i &apos;ve got a hy@@ dr@@ o con@@ version at a wat@@ er@@ m@@ ill that i own .
in other words , we can be poli@@ tically right but emotion@@ ally wrong .
there is a number of robo@@ tic systems .
100 million comp@@ act flu@@ ores@@ cent light bul@@ bs means that we &apos;ll save 600 million dollars in energy bil@@ ls , and 20 million tons of co2 every year , year in and year out .
it was a simple machine that changed my life .
but like the mag@@ in@@ ot line , the great fire@@ wall of china was fac@@ ing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copy@@ right mathema@@ ticians who are media lo@@ b@@ by experts are mer@@ ely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get com@@ po@@ unded for in@@ fl@@ ation every year .
thank you .
the fear is the child .
so the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic and we@@ ak forces are descri@@ bed by this pattern of partic@@ le char@@ ges in two-@@ dimensional space .
but at the end of the day , when we talk about cities , we talk about a gather@@ ing of people .
the hor@@ se is out of the bar@@ n . help me out here , okay ?
let me take a pol@@ l . how many of you think there are more mal@@ es in the world ?
and then you shake it r@@ and@@ om@@ ly and it starts to er@@ ror correct and built the structure on its own .
it &apos;s a well-@@ establi@@ shed fact of these animals that they actually blu@@ ff . they can &apos;t actually stri@@ ke , but they pre@@ tend to .
we finished ps 2@@ 34 , and had dinner with a small group .
the good news , for what it &apos;s worth , is after ser@@ gi@@ o and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the u.@@ n. , the military created a search and res@@ cu@@ e unit that had the cu@@ tting equipment , the shor@@ ing wood , the cran@@ es , the things that you would have needed to do the res@@ cu@@ e .
so she pul@@ led up the c@@ d of the scan images , and look at all those hot spots .
and so what is this ? how does this work ?
so , ur@@ ani@@ um , which is very big , wants to split .
it &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of english .
but when they were divided , indeed they were divided , and we do see the contin@@ ents car@@ ving differences among dinosau@@ rs .
so ph@@ .@@ d. this , and degree there , and the y@@ ad@@ da y@@ ad@@ da .
and alexander said , &quot; i am con@@ qu@@ ering the world . &quot;
we can see it at work in the earli@@ est sta@@ ges of human history .
or even worse , if you are diagn@@ os@@ ed with something eventually , and the doctor didn &apos;t order that test , you get su@@ ed .
and i think , kind of , as a surgeon , he basically said , &quot; kid , i sa@@ ved your life .
and instead that money went to under@@ write the wars in y@@ ug@@ os@@ la@@ vi@@ a and line the po@@ ckets of uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous individuals .
we could send congress on an auton@@ om@@ ous car road trip .
and this person , mr. ubi@@ ra@@ jar@@ a .
and then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well .
and indeed , it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected .
they went five miles an hour and inside it was 10@@ 5 degrees in the pit@@ ch dark .
oh , well .
he later wrote , &quot; it &apos;s okay , some of my best friends are na@@ ked sa@@ va@@ ges . &quot;
but first , i want to take you on a little journey .
and i can tell you all the details about the micro@@ bi@@ al study that we did there , but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project .
jo@@ h@@ ne@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .com so we keep on insu@@ l@@ ting people left and right everyday .
to prevent that , we have tradition@@ ally used fire .
i &apos;m going to let him , in this very short clip , describe his impres@@ sions of the therapy in his own words .
that is great .
well , of course , as soon as anybody did look , which was after about 20 years , when radio astronom@@ y really took off . because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radi@@ ating in the radio spectrum , much bri@@ ghter than the sun .
this pro@@ be actually can &apos;t use chemical ro@@ ckets .
and i must say , i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to s@@ wal@@ low today and finally gave up on , but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing .
and he said , &quot; as god as my wit@@ ness , i &apos;ve had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you &apos;ve built it .
today , we don &apos;t have to go to cu@@ ba to find a healthy country in la@@ tin america .
hands it over , and then gets some food .
that &apos;s very practical and extremely a@@ wes@@ ome .
the tor@@ ture was good . wasn &apos;t it good tor@@ ture ?
i have three wi@@ shes . well , i can &apos;t do much about africa .
i really have the feeling that pleas@@ ant things work better , and that never made any sense to me until i finally figured out -- look ...
this , on a ligh@@ ter note , is at george lu@@ c@@ as &apos; personal archi@@ ve .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
i ch@@ ose pap@@ er@@ cu@@ tting because paper is cheap , it &apos;s light , and you can use it in a lot of different ways .
we think these little wir@@ eless sens@@ ors are more effective .
i went to not@@ re d@@ ame university and gradu@@ ated with degrees in accoun@@ ting and german , including spending a year of study in au@@ stri@@ a .
many times , the prison auth@@ orities have den@@ i@@ ed ever having issues of drug ab@@ use , issues of so@@ dom@@ y , so many issues they would den@@ y that it ever happens .
it &apos;s amazing : just on the pun@@ y power of the sun -- by having a su@@ per ligh@@ t@@ weight plane , you &apos;re able to get it up there .
he down@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed data from the nasa so@@ h@@ o satellite , and that &apos;s how he found them .
it was like du@@ stin hoff@@ man in &quot; the graduate , &quot; right , when he said &quot; pla@@ stics , &quot; whatever that means , pla@@ stics .
now , we probably think a pri@@ or@@ i that &apos;s un@@ likely .
every child who needs treatment is treated .
ultimately , i started with the experience .
they recei@@ ve surgery the following day , and then they will stay for a day or two , and then they are put back on the bus@@ es to be taken back to where they came from , and where their families will be waiting to take them back home .
and i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m unique .
you just need inspi@@ ration , vision and determin@@ ation .
please note it &apos;s a museum spec@@ im@@ en , but there &apos;s no chance you &apos;ll get the avi@@ an flu .
but there is no goal within this health reform .
so when i go back now to give you the answer of the qui@@ z , it &apos;s two .
now this became my new secret identi@@ ty , and the first thing i did as a s@@ la@@ yer was call my t@@ win sister -- i have an iden@@ tical t@@ win sister named kel@@ ly -- and tell her , i &apos;m playing a game to he@@ al my brain , and i want you to play with me .
sit in bed , two in the morning , watch tv ; your sp@@ ouse , or someone , is next to you , as@@ le@@ ep ; doesn &apos;t hear it , doesn &apos;t wake up .
unbe@@ know@@ nst to many of you , the highway in the sky that i &apos;m talking about here has been under construction for 10 years .
expl@@ or@@ ation is the engine that dri@@ ves innovation .
beyond one milli@@ meter , the root is in@@ effective .
and so , here you go .
so , knowing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fighting community in new york , they opened the brooklyn super@@ hero supply company .
so to do that we &apos;ve launched a number of part@@ ner@@ ships with n@@ gos and universi@@ ties to ga@@ ther data on the user inter@@ face , on the types of sur@@ ger@@ ies it &apos;s appropriate for and ways we can en@@ han@@ ce the device itself .
it pres@@ ents , not just the comple@@ xi@@ ties found in a pro@@ cession of different human beings , but the comple@@ xi@@ ties found within each individual person .
now , the only way we could design that , or possibly constru@@ ct it , is by using a calcul@@ us-@@ based definition of the form .
a very difficult time , actually .
now even after all of this gran@@ ular level of control , do fu@@ tur@@ eless language speak@@ ers seem to save more ?
there are some people who are very good at this .
we fac@@ ed rwand@@ a ; we fac@@ ed bos@@ nia , and then we re@@ discovered our con@@ fi@@ dence .
she gets into the car -- she &apos;s sitting on two phone books .
so after this experience , my art teacher , mr. shil@@ ale , he brought in these picture books , and i thought , &quot; picture books for kids ! &quot;
certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to de@@ va@@ state the place , turning everything that will burn into heat , or drink the water that &apos;s available .
and i heard stories that sh@@ at@@ tered all the other stories .
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
we don &apos;t have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense .
india has the yo@@ un@@ gest growing population in the world .
so here we have lu@@ d@@ ot@@ ru@@ ck , which is in l@@ .a. , doing the things that g@@ our@@ met food trucks do , and they &apos;ve gather@@ ed quite a following .
need@@ less to say , i no longer d@@ ine with these people .
so what i &apos;d like to show you now , in the couple of minutes i have left , is a film that a student made in gu@@ atem@@ ala .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our dau@@ gh@@ ters &apos; mou@@ ths .
james hansen : why i must speak out about climate change
we needed medicine .
i had to bring it in .
so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by ap@@ pl@@ ying robo@@ tic technologies to this problem .
you don &apos;t choose the spo@@ ken word .
and then we have to fli@@ p the image for you to see that it &apos;s a set up .
so we have two prototyp@@ es .
it &apos;s a hor@@ ri@@ fic story . someone took a bottle of ty@@ len@@ ol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
what you and i understand as a government doesn &apos;t exist in many african countries .
you &apos;ve just broken a law .
so , this was a vital in@@ je@@ ction of cash into the u.s. economy .
but this -- i just want to show you some data here .
democra@@ cies make even more of a m@@ ess of these resour@@ ce bo@@ oms than auto@@ cra@@ cies .
they work through interaction -- they create a cap@@ ability , and then it uses that cap@@ ability to bring on the next stage .
so that &apos;s the up@@ date about this game , cat@@ -@@ and-@@ mouse .
i &apos;ve been building top@@ soil .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spre@@ ading .
that &apos;s hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth .
and it &apos;s interesting when you make a film like this , because you &apos;re stuck trying to visu@@ alize science that there &apos;s no visu@@ alization for .
i &apos;m not ment@@ ally ill . &quot;
when i got out of office and was asked to work , first in the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an , to try to help deal with the aids crisis , gen@@ eric drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year .
oh , hey , hey , black@@ -@@ e@@ yed susie ! hey , hey , black@@ -@@ e@@ yed susie !
hopefully you can appreciate the device there cur@@ ving through the patient &apos;s body and re@@ moving the patient &apos;s bone mar@@ row , instead of with 200 pun@@ c@@ tures , with just a single pun@@ c@@ ture under local an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
they &apos;re not just sitting there .
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measu@@ red its vel@@ oc@@ ity , it would be moving away from you .
it &apos;s not because some people don &apos;t survive childhood ill@@ n@@ esses -- they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach about 45 years old and 50 years old .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
and hopefully in the next five years , i &apos;ll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
well , a good guide is to think , &quot; what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world ? &quot;
so , i did it .
so we looked at how we could comp@@ ose all those elements -- instead of just li@@ tter , create one com@@ position .
and governments do very well . they p@@ at themselves on the back .
i &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19@@ th century -- actually , in the second decade of the 19@@ th century -- by a 2@@ 7@@ -year-old po@@ et whose name was per@@ cy shel@@ ley .
and what was really great is , i &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and lau@@ ra sent me a follo@@ w-@@ up e@@ mail because a good month had passed by .
all of these are extra@@ cted directly from my bank accoun@@ ts , and everything pop@@ s up right away .
you don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
you can pass it around .
so , you won &apos;t see all the really cool stuff that &apos;s in this series el@@ a@@ stic set of 14 actu@@ ators , each one which has its own cap@@ ability to sense temperature and pressure .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleas@@ ures like art , but even the most seem@@ ingly simple pleas@@ ures are affected by our belie@@ fs about hidden essen@@ ces .
i also want you to think of his name . look at me and think of his name .
and the key idea to ba@@ y@@ es@@ ian in@@ ference is you have two sour@@ ces of information from which to make your in@@ ference .
when you buy a piece of software , it &apos;s not like buying a v@@ ase or a cand@@ y bar , where you own it .
another thing i can show you is , more often than not , doctors get to meet patients in x-ray form .
they showed bloo@@ dy gu@@ ms .
in fact it really was the cli@@ ents who had to do it .
and how can we change that ?
and ro@@ ckets are small . so you have to make it smaller .
one of them is women &apos;s verb@@ al ability . women can talk .
so ultimately , my goal is to create something unexpected .
i like animals , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to industri@@ alize their production and to chur@@ n them out like they were wr@@ en@@ ches .
and the text@@ book , i think , knows how it &apos;s ham@@ str@@ inging students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
one day soon after that -- it was a fri@@ day -- at the end of the day , i went down -- i was going down to the sub@@ way . it was rush hour and thousands of people were stre@@ am@@ ing down the sta@@ irs .
there &apos;s a new not@@ ation in the 19@@ th century that expres@@ sed this , and if you use that not@@ ation , the equ@@ ations get a lot simpler .
d@@ ap@@ hne koll@@ er : so this is which co@@ in you pick , and this is the two tos@@ ses .
here &apos;s one of my fel@@ low winn@@ ers . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under far@@ ming conditions in britain . &quot;
whereas -- and it &apos;s true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as lingu@@ istic place fil@@ lers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is , we &apos;ll just call it this -- it &apos;s the beginning of the cau@@ sal cha@@ in for science .
we &apos;re a re@@ crea@@ tional vehicle that doesn &apos;t really matter , and i don &apos;t spend my time doing that kind of stuff .
i used to be a mar@@ ath@@ on r@@ un@@ ner .
now , mathema@@ ticians have been hi@@ ding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time , but it &apos;s clear they were mathema@@ ticians and not bi@@ ologists because , if you write long messages with the code that the mathema@@ ticians developed , it would more than likely lead to new prot@@ eins being syn@@ thes@@ ized with un@@ known fun@@ ctions .
she &apos;s wonderful . i used to be on the board of the royal bal@@ let in england , as you can see .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared .
comes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; well what &apos;s the story ? &quot;
and this is such an in@@ version , and such a wonderful example of children being the ag@@ ents of change .
that ain &apos;t happening anymore .
the problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating and de@@ bili@@ tating condition that arch@@ ie doesn &apos;t really understand .
we can end up , as we get in a world with more cen@@ s@@ ors -- everywhere there is something fil@@ ming you , maybe putting it online -- to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says , &quot; you know , i &apos;d rather not . &quot;
if you ag@@ gre@@ gate it , it &apos;s the third largest economy on earth , and yet most of these people go invisible .
ti@@ ming is important . pro@@ xim@@ ity is important .
but over here , the heads of the d@@ fs , mr. r@@ .@@ c. shar@@ man , mr. a.@@ k. shar@@ man , led the fire@@ fight with their men .
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we atta@@ ched to that ?
and so then i learned that listening is not only about waiting , but it &apos;s also learning how better to ask questions .
i think that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance on the continent .
and i expect to speak in the first s@@ ession of the 3@@ 9@@ th ted india .
i &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
this is as of 9 a.@@ m. this morning .
they had to sus@@ p@@ end fun@@ ctions at 8 : 30 .
so ever since then , before i would go anywhere , i would call the f@@ b@@ i .
k@@ ary mul@@ li@@ s : a ne@@ x@@ t-@@ gen cure for killer infe@@ ctions
i didn &apos;t see either of the plan@@ es hit , and when i gl@@ an@@ ced out my window , i saw the first tower burning , and i thought it might have been an acci@@ dent .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
it &apos;s her cute little , flu@@ ff@@ y pet kit@@ ten .
we have to have a shared inti@@ macy , a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family ; we have to understand ourselves that way .
on his own , he wrote these sent@@ ences .
now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
they have a fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess and a freedom that i believe is the bedro@@ ck of a new paradigm .
i also got at the time a work@@ book which explained my rights and my working conditions , and i still have that work@@ book .
and then from spa@@ in , it went to it@@ al@@ y , and then germany got excited , and maybe right now the u.k. is enjo@@ ying it .
and i &apos;m very , very sto@@ ked — you guys are just ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ding for everything . it &apos;s great .
and i actually didn &apos;t leave my house for about three days .
and so that number also dem@@ ands food .
and the reason for this is , fir@@ stly , because the state in china is given a very special -- it enjo@@ ys a very special signifi@@ can@@ ce as the repres@@ ent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the guar@@ dian of chinese civilization , of the civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
and they &apos;re starting to domin@@ ate lots of professi@@ ons -- doctors , lawyers , ban@@ kers , accoun@@ tan@@ ts .
and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime .
and then we un@@ plu@@ g@@ ged .
so that &apos;s a very good reason beyond curi@@ osity to justi@@ fy what we &apos;re doing , and to justi@@ fy having some interest in what is going on in our brains .
in practice , the norden bom@@ b@@ sight can drop a bomb into a pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions .
no , the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s tail results from the ma@@ ting choices made by pe@@ ah@@ ens .
we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to m@@ ess with it , say by c@@ -@@ se@@ ctions or by antibio@@ tics or exc@@ essi@@ ve cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess , without some real good justi@@ fication .
and as an anthrop@@ olog@@ ist , i see these differences in experience being ro@@ ot@@ ed in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us .
when this happened , a part of me thought , well , what &apos;s the big deal ?
the ex@@ hibi@@ tion was designed to be an experience , and t@@ ap@@ est@@ ries are hard to re@@ produce in photographs .
guns bar@@ king like ligh@@ t@@ ning and th@@ under .
i really am hon@@ or@@ ed to be here , and as chris said , it &apos;s been over 20 years since i started working in africa .
les@@ lie by@@ r@@ ne , a demo@@ cr@@ at from virginia , descri@@ bes that when she went to congress , she was told by a colleague , &quot; always le@@ an to the green . &quot;
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 15@@ 1 minds ?
actually , not that long ago .
sometimes the mon@@ keys get two extra .
so let &apos;s look at the app@@ lications .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . green .
we have the pe@@ g legs there , that are all hand@@ made and fit@@ ted to you .
long conflict can wre@@ ck a country , leaving behind poverty and chaos . but what &apos;s the right way to help war@@ -@@ tor@@ n countries re@@ build ? at ted @ state , paul colli@@ er expla@@ ins the problems with current po@@ st-@@ conflict aid plan@@ s , and sugge@@ sts 3 ideas for a better approach .
i know , i could bar@@ ely u@@ tter them .
now there are over 3@@ 0,000 .
it takes place in real time and you can &apos;t control what you &apos;re going to say . &quot;
and of course , most of you don &apos;t support the insur@@ gency ; you don &apos;t support killing americans ; you don &apos;t support the terror@@ ists .
you &apos;re going to open an off@@ sh@@ ore plant in china , you &apos;re going to spend it all on sales and marketing , you &apos;re going to go to ta@@ hit@@ i , or whatever out there .
we &apos;re im@@ passion@@ ed with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to re@@ place a v@@ ein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in micro@@ electr@@ on@@ ics , perhaps drink a coffee in a c@@ up and throw it away without gu@@ ilt , maybe carry your drugs in your po@@ cket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thre@@ ad of silk .
it had gotten a lot better since 4 a.@@ m. &quot;
and yet , of course , that little in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble piece of data doesn &apos;t fac@@ tor into our g@@ dp calcul@@ ations .
and it creates a kind of plan@@ ned emer@@ gence .
the original building , because it was fro@@ g-@@ like , fit ni@@ c@@ ely on the site and cran@@ ked itself well .
but how ?
and also , you can imagine , a whole group of people with the same suit will have this moun@@ ting collective he@@ art@@ beat that will be sc@@ ary to the police .
now , i had heard this phr@@ ase , &quot; age of reason , &quot; before .
these are all the prototyp@@ es . these are the mistakes , although i don &apos;t think mistakes is the right word in design .
so it &apos;s not a sur@@ re@@ p@@ ti@@ tious technology .
how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral exper@@ ti@@ se , or moral talent , or moral genius even ?
my guess is that some great simpli@@ fi@@ cations of what i &apos;m doing may actually have consi@@ der@@ able reson@@ ance with what &apos;s been done in str@@ ing theory , but that &apos;s a complicated math thing that i don &apos;t yet know how it &apos;s going to work out .
i &apos;m going to go across india on the back of an eleph@@ ant .
if you just take influ@@ enz@@ a , you will see pe@@ a@@ ks at the time where you knew big flu epide@@ mi@@ cs were killing people around the glo@@ be .
what if we started asking , &quot; how do we let people pay for music ? &quot;
and the fact is that there were immedi@@ ate wo@@ unds and needs that needed to be filled , and there was talk about inclu@@ sion and wan@@ ting it to be an inclu@@ sive process .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much bal@@ on@@ ey .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-@@ ol@@ ds -- ro@@ bu@@ stly healthy young adults .
pretty much everybody is rational .
but you didn &apos;t have him design the engine ?
and that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
this lady &apos;s adver@@ tis@@ ing for her lost p@@ it bu@@ ll .
life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible dire@@ ctions in three dimen@@ sions .
so he &apos;s actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face .
ok . so , the first one i was very ti@@ mi@@ d , and i &apos;ll begin .
created a whole bunch of levels for it .
if we see someone in a wheelchair , we assu@@ me they cannot walk .
some people question , &quot; why is it in black and white ?
so this is an example from the y@@ a@@ ho@@ o regi@@ stration page .
it &apos;s just an intellectual property se@@ tu@@ p .
how did you then make the decision and assu@@ me the responsi@@ bilities of running a newsp@@ aper , especially in such times of conflict ?
where the te@@ me machines themselves will repli@@ cate themselves .
one of the reasons why we &apos;re moving away from ban@@ qu@@ eting hall@@ s such as the one in which we stand , ban@@ qu@@ eting hall@@ s with extraordinary images on the cei@@ ling of k@@ ings en@@ thr@@ oned , the entire dra@@ ma played out here on this space , where the king of england had his head lo@@ pped off , why we &apos;ve moved from spaces like this , thr@@ ones like that , towards the town hall , is we &apos;re moving more and more towards the energi@@ es of our people , and we need to ta@@ p that .
if you look at the x-@@ axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that what we common@@ ly want to do -- which is keeping the out@@ doors out -- we accomp@@ li@@ shed that with mechan@@ ical v@@ enti@@ lation .
zz@@ zz@@ z@@ zi@@ p for safety .
and i also said to her , &quot; now these so@@ ws . i mean , you may have noticed there , the so@@ w doesn &apos;t look to be in the thro@@ es of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y . &quot;
they work together . they make the cell do what it needs to do .
and many countries are going to go bri@@ ck@@ less from the start because they &apos;re never going to be able to afford the mega@@ -@@ medi@@ cal@@ ple@@ xes that a lot of the rest of the world has built .
what they have swe@@ ated so far has no meaning .
i was looking for some kind of form , and in the end , i made 100 bu@@ tter@@ -@@ fri@@ es . do you get it ?
when that happened , he started calling all the neigh@@ bor@@ hood children , like , children would come and see what &apos;s happening over here .
the other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal .
but i found that the problems of psych@@ ology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology , enter@@ tain@@ ment and design in the following way .
gray was a soldier in the american ar@@ my in world war ii .
we actually have about 24@@ ,000 genes that do things .
i ho@@ sted a television show by that name on p@@ bs .
and it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music .
and so , she really just completely ignor@@ ed me most of the time .
it is one one-@@ hund@@ red@@ th of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us .
you should hear some of the phone conver@@ sa@@ tions that i have with people on my blu@@ et@@ o@@ oth in the shop .
what happened ?
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
now — — as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard , i got no problem with this .
i want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very , very clear limits .
i was the most popular person online .
we are always , constantly playing the zero sum game .
we &apos;re supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep .
pla@@ stic@@ ity means that there was always hope for our reason -- hope for our ability to re@@ build that function .
except , of course , it has two business ris@@ ks : ar@@ rest by law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , which is , fran@@ k@@ ly , the least of their wor@@ ries , and competition from other groups , i.@@ e. a bul@@ let in the back of the head .
well , the reason it &apos;s such a bad job is that there &apos;s somebody sho@@ ot@@ ing at you a lot of the time .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fi@@ x the outside so much , but our control of the ou@@ ter world is limited , temporary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
it &apos;s the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so anima@@ tes you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes in@@ significant .
and they can be mod@@ el@@ ed by a spr@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &apos;re biom@@ e@@ chan@@ ists . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
well done , everyone . now that is worth pl@@ us-@@ one physical resili@@ ence , which means that your body can with@@ stand more stress and he@@ al itself faster .
possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not ide@@ al for everyday wear .
instead , they set up their lives so that they are constantly nu@@ d@@ ged into physical activity .
well , we have an idea .
moving on , there &apos;s more than just natural history ben@@ e@@ ath the sea -- human history . our dis@@ cover@@ ies of the titanic .
simple , beautiful fur@@ ni@@ ture ?
i loved the attention .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
they feel that they &apos;ve actually ga@@ ined what they never had , that their face now refle@@ cts their person@@ ality .
the vast rural areas , where 100 million people lived , there were no tele@@ phones .
quiet parts could be heard that would have been dro@@ w@@ ned out by all the g@@ ossi@@ ping and sh@@ ou@@ ting .
i &apos;m a big adv@@ oc@@ ate of changing the ligh@@ t@@ bul@@ bs and buying hy@@ bri@@ ds , and tipp@@ er and i put 3@@ 3 solar pan@@ els on our house , and du@@ g the geo@@ ther@@ mal w@@ ells , and did all of that other stuff .
surge@@ ons are not made either .
how the media cover@@ s africa in the west , and the con@@ sequences of that .
some people will find very sc@@ ary . i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to proje@@ cti@@ le pu@@ ke on me , but that &apos;s okay .
and that is the trans@@ lation of the feel@@ ings that we may have about compassion into the wider world , into action .
but that wasn &apos;t the kind of robot my dad had in mind .
because of the problems with my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um and its slow growth about a year and a half ago , we decided to syn@@ thes@@ ize the much larger chromosome , the my@@ co@@ i@@ des chromosome , knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplan@@ tation .
so this is whether you use a f@@ ou@@ l od@@ or , a bad taste , from film clips , from po@@ st-@@ h@@ yp@@ no@@ tic sugge@@ sti@@ ons of dis@@ g@@ ust , images like the ones i &apos;ve shown you , even just re@@ min@@ ding people that disease is pre@@ valent and they should be war@@ y of it and was@@ h up , right , to keep clean , these all have similar effects on jud@@ gment .
his son will soon be 14 years old .
now during this time , the book was the king of stor@@ y@@ telling .
it &apos;s got light organs in the mouth , in a mu@@ cus la@@ yer on the back and the bel@@ ly , all used for different things -- some of which we know about , some of which we don &apos;t .
and how can we reach that goal ?
that was po@@ st-@@ war europe .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recycl@@ able stuff ends up getting in@@ cin@@ er@@ ated or in land@@ fil@@ ls and leaving many m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ alities , di@@ version rates -- they leave much to be recycl@@ ed .
e@@ gos , of course , again , a huge problem if you &apos;re working in a multi@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benef@@ it of the dou@@ bt .
gh : ok , e for effort .
so how &apos;d they figure this out ?
i don &apos;t like neutr@@ ality in life , in anything .
so what do they do ?
what about ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und ?
mos@@ quit@@ o@@ es only drink blood to lay eggs .
which works mathema@@ tically , but it just doesn &apos;t seem go@@ d-@@ like to me .
so the hyper@@ b@@ ole is not actually surprising .
the pun@@ ch line ?
that &apos;s why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill .
and i &apos;ll come back to that in a minute , because i think the results so far have been remarkable , and i can only anti@@ ci@@ pate and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years , while we get to the 2015 initiative .
it &apos;s the future . it &apos;s the only way .
they &apos;ve been in use , in architecture , since ancient times .
we made it all fre@@ ely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of air@@ stream .
and if you look at historical pictures of the early oper@@ ating ro@@ oms , they have been on top of buildings .
oh , and one more thing , and as an edu@@ c@@ ator , this is the one that really bo@@ thers me : if argument is war , then there &apos;s an imp@@ lic@@ it equ@@ ation of learning with los@@ ing .
we have now , and are the first generation with , the power to do this .
&quot; i &apos;m convinced , &quot; i told a german offi@@ cial with the world bank , &quot; that it would be impossible for them to be bri@@ bed if they worked in germany , in a german ad@@ minist@@ ration , just as i am convinced that if you put german offi@@ ci@@ als from the german ad@@ minist@@ ration in those hol@@ es , they would be bri@@ bed just the same . &quot;
he just wants to get to the front row .
you &apos;re actually hearing and seeing the electr@@ on flow with the lines .
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
poverty , des@@ pair , strug@@ gle .
it wasn &apos;t the res@@ u@@ me of bre@@ aking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps .
i told ti@@ m , &quot; if you could just see the micro@@ bes , it &apos;s kind of like being in co@@ sta ri@@ ca . kind of . &quot;
and you can see that the green neuron tou@@ ches the red neuron at two lo@@ cations , and these are what are called syn@@ ap@@ ses .
and so the next step -- the si@@ x@@ th step beyond &quot; universal compassion &quot; -- is this thing where you &apos;re lin@@ ked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t senti@@ mental only . you might be in fear of something .
and i think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology , is that the technology trans@@ fer is so easy .
so i &apos;ll close with a short discus@@ sion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
i &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
and you can imagine a lot more app@@ lications .
it has a feel@@ er , where it can feel obstac@@ les and turn around .
and for those people that don &apos;t want to do either of those things , maybe they can co@@ ok , so we pick them seas@@ on@@ ally and then we go on the street , or in the pu@@ b , or in the church , or wherever people are living their lives .
you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other , from one group of ne@@ sts to the next .
it &apos;s a simple formul@@ a : eat food .
i knew cra@@ ig and respe@@ cted him .
but help was coming .
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
think about something you &apos;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
11@@ th who am i ? isn &apos;t that the biggest question ?
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the dar@@ k@@ ness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
the amazing part of this process -- and of course , i mean , i would love to -- i only have 18 minutes , i &apos;ve already given you quite a substan@@ ti@@ al amount of my time , right ?
and i &apos;d like to thank you all .
and i just wanted to finish by mention@@ ing a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at stanford and caltech .
yeah , there you go .
for me , every day is a new thing .
genetics has opened the door to the study of human vari@@ ability .
so , thank you . another person , another card .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the dark side , with yesterday &apos;s the@@ me .
and it fac@@ es into a park .
it &apos;s only a percent and a half of the country &apos;s co2 emissions . it &apos;s a great start , but i &apos;ve got to tell you -- where i started -- i &apos;m really afraid .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sta@@ ying in a hotel down@@ town .
i &apos;ll do some things you could never imagine possible . &quot;
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years , and what i learned when i came to the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wild@@ life , and the amazing quali@@ ties that pengu@@ ins have .
if you see somebody in the blue -- yeah , this guy -- he was a prisoner , and he was a teacher .
at early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squ@@ e@@ e@@ zed into a region about this big -- literally -- at early times .
sam@@ anth@@ a power : a complicated hero
but even though i had this new@@ found joy and freedom , people &apos;s re@@ action completely changed towards me .
i talked to my father . i did something that most girls have never done .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
so my point is , there &apos;s a lot of strug@@ gle has gone in europe , where citizens were em@@ powered by technologies .
he was or@@ der@@ ing multiple appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers , multiple ent@@ r@@ é@@ es , for me as well , and suddenly there are pil@@ es and pil@@ es of food on our table , also lots and lots of bot@@ t@@ les of w@@ ine .
it &apos;s africa that already is affected .
my daughter gave me a rather nice an@@ ec@@ do@@ te on this .
so : i believe very soon , we &apos;re not only going to have better movies , we &apos;ll have that original niger@@ ian movie .
and we finally figured out how to do it .
what has happened is this : that china is growing , it &apos;s not so equal any longer , and it &apos;s appe@@ aring here , over@@ looking the united states .
and that gives you a great deal of pleasure , to see them go on .
and you know the reason why , of course .
but then , i was ex@@ posed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the main@@ stream -- which is never identi@@ fied , respe@@ cted , applied on a large scale .
what would it be like to be impro@@ ving the human lot ?
why is it such a bad job ?
no , what i want to do is take you back to 18@@ 5@@ 4 in london for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in brief -- of this out@@ break , which in many ways , i think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today .
in fact , there appe@@ ars to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter , ok .
and number five : i wish i &apos;d lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me .
they are the eli@@ te . they are our leaders .
this is prac@@ tically the model of ted .
yeah . so , i went and started looking .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 7@@ 0-@@ year-old women playing bridge .
so after being at mit for a few years , i realized that writing academic pap@@ ers is not that exciting .
so what else can you do do not win an os@@ car for best ac@@ tr@@ ess .
quite the opposite of the world bank , who comp@@ iled data with government money , ta@@ x money , and then they sell it to add a little profit , in a very in@@ efficient , gu@@ ten@@ berg way .
and the way the internet works is the rou@@ ters are basically ex@@ changing information about how they can get messages to places , and this one process@@ or , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
li@@ za don@@ nel@@ ly : drawing on humor for change
so they &apos;re restri@@ ctive -- don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the internet , don &apos;t be on i.@@ m .
thir@@ ty years have passed , and i still feel gu@@ il@@ ty about that pra@@ yer , for the next day , i learned that that mis@@ si@@ le land@@ ed on my brother &apos;s friend &apos;s home and killed him and his father , but did not kill his mother or his sister .
i love public art .
on@@ stage at ted@@ 2012 , j@@ ack cho@@ i demon@@ str@@ ates a powerful tool for training medical students : a stre@@ t@@ cher@@ -@@ si@@ zed multi@@ -@@ touch screen of the human body that lets you explore , dis@@ se@@ ct and understand the body &apos;s parts and systems .
then , of course , the next question is : &quot; do you bel@@ ong to any groups that wish to har@@ m the united states ? &quot;
the next thing i want to talk about is school fe@@ eding .
d@@ r : yeah , surprising .
now is my book the next great american novel ?
and i was the 40 percent ow@@ ner of a d@@ ot@@ com that was about to go public and no dou@@ bt be worth billions more .
it &apos;s a tab@@ let , a simple tab@@ let , and when i take it with water , it does mi@@ ra@@ cles .
i have half a dozen ideas .
people are rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to talk about it -- there &apos;s a fear associated with it .
and every week on this television show , d@@ han@@ i tra@@ vels to a different nation of the world .
if an@@ to@@ ine de sa@@ in@@ t-@@ ex@@ u@@ per@@ y , the author of &quot; the little prin@@ ce , &quot; were here , he would have dra@@ wn three hol@@ es inside that box and told you your she@@ ep was inside .
but i &apos;d like to supp@@ lement their work with a little psych@@ ological trick , and the trick is this .
and that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a predi@@ ction .
when ra@@ m dies , kr@@ is@@ hn@@ a is born .
and i feel now like george bush .
schools can &apos;t be si@@ los .
even in my g@@ aller@@ y shows , i try and re@@ visit histor@@ ic events like bab@@ r@@ i mas@@ j@@ id , di@@ still only its emo@@ tional res@@ i@@ due and image my own life .
and just notice how she roll@@ s under and turns ; she doesn &apos;t sit there and try and b@@ low air into a tank and kind of flow up or sin@@ k down -- she just roll@@ s .
i &apos;m learning this at 40 .
and we sat . and at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. we put a sandwich board out on the front side@@ walk and it just said , &quot; free tu@@ tor@@ ing for your engli@@ sh@@ -@@ related and wri@@ t@@ ing-@@ related needs -- just come in , it &apos;s all free . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twi@@ ce the country &apos;s an@@ nu@@ al health and education budget combined .
and we never think about the hidden connection .
because of the hunger , i was forced to drop out of school .
i mean actually respe@@ cting them , respe@@ cting what they &apos;ve achiev@@ ed .
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dig@@ ni@@ fied lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear .
so , the first thing is the immedi@@ acy of ideas , the speed at which ideas go around .
for example , n@@ al@@ ini am@@ b@@ ady , a resear@@ cher at tu@@ f@@ ts university , shows that when people watch 3@@ 0-@@ second so@@ und@@ less clips of real physici@@ an-@@ patient interactions , their jud@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ cian &apos;s ni@@ cen@@ ess predict whether or not that physi@@ cian will be su@@ ed .
it &apos;s like a ro@@ de@@ o show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get re@@ war@@ ded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
in nigeria , people carry their most pre@@ cious bel@@ ong@@ ings on their heads .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
states that are more rural -- even to some ex@@ tent of the states like new h@@ amp@@ shi@@ re and ma@@ ine -- they ex@@ hi@@ bit a little bit of this ra@@ ci@@ all@@ y-@@ based vot@@ ing against bar@@ ack ob@@ ama .
it looks like the web did back in 1997 , right ?
and now that i have , i want to give you a gift . &quot;
about 200 times usually .
without the care@@ gi@@ ver , they wouldn &apos;t survive , so it stands to reason that nature would en@@ dow them with these mechan@@ is@@ ms of survival .
why should we care ?
if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage , some tens of mega@@ watts of wind power stopped p@@ our@@ ing into the grid , the difference would have to be made up from other gener@@ ators immediately .
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
she went to vo@@ ca@@ tional school for accoun@@ ting .
her father the king said , &quot; don &apos;t whist@@ le . &quot;
no . i love it .
it &apos;s not just about life , of course -- -- it &apos;s about healthy life , you know -- getting fra@@ il and miser@@ able and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun .
you can &apos;t farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutri@@ ent flow .
and whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . &quot;
and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they &apos;re going through , getting to know their families -- i wanted that , but i couldn &apos;t do it in a school with 1,@@ 600 kids , and teachers turning over year after year after year .
there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and sp@@ ous@@ es and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts , which is , &quot; why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or belie@@ ves ? &quot;
why this might be the case ?
your brand starts being dis@@ per@@ sed , it gets more cha@@ otic .
we &apos;re able to drive down area 25 , down to a more normal level , and we &apos;re able to turn back online the frontal lo@@ bes of the brain , and indeed we &apos;re seeing very striking results in these patients with sever@@ e depression .
and we &apos;ve certainly lear@@ nt that over time , you get much better brain@@ stor@@ ming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
and i just up@@ d@@ ated these graph@@ s .
he said , &quot; we used to feel like no@@ bodies , but now we feel like some@@ bodies . &quot;
and by the way , a repor@@ ter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia and he said he saw my bir@@ th@@ day was au@@ g@@ ust 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d 194@@ 9 , and for some od@@ d reason in wikipedia , they had my death date too .
so we came up with a great solution : train grand@@ mothers .
so , to make co@@ o@@ king really a very important element , i would say even philosop@@ hers have to change and have to finally recognize that co@@ o@@ king is what made us .
and so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in thailand for jos@@ h pl@@ ot@@ nik -- is we have an appar@@ at@@ us around which there is a rop@@ e , a single rop@@ e .
in health care today , we spend most of the dollars -- in terms of tre@@ ating disease -- most of the dollars in the last two years of a person &apos;s life .
and then i said to myself , i &apos;ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
they have it forced upon them .
we probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; fantastic ! what a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger stati@@ st@@ ical results than we could .
i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of , and i was incredibly lucky .
they do lots of in@@ consi@@ stent things .
metal@@ lic objects -- al@@ b@@ eit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escap@@ ed into orbit around the earth .
it &apos;s active in the gulf of gu@@ in@@ ea .
mor@@ e@@ over , they have the mechan@@ is@@ ms to map all these sm@@ ells and to communicate about it .

you get -- you get , like -- i just had a natural feeling for science and se@@ tting up experiments . i thought that was the way everybody had always thought .
but with lots of intelligent people foc@@ using on whether food is organic or local , or whether we &apos;re being nice to animals , the most important issues just aren &apos;t being addres@@ sed .
and i &apos;d love to talk about that -- and it &apos;d be fun -- but , 20 years later ...
but with the limited time we have available , i &apos;d like to show you the cogni@@ tive su@@ ite , which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind .
&quot; i don &apos;t understand . so@@ ybe@@ ans ?
so you have an image , a re@@ tin@@ a , and a brain .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest my@@ ths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical break@@ through@@ s and then all of our problems will be solved .
so we felt that that day was the day that she really ear@@ ned her name .
but of course , mental ill@@ n@@ esses can kill in more direct ways as well . the most obvious example is su@@ i@@ cide .
i put a team together .
if the ancient gre@@ e@@ ks had found out about seas@@ ons in australi@@ a , they could have easily vari@@ ed their my@@ th to predict that .
there are challenges . there are challenges .
somebody put up a tool during the copy@@ right debate last year in the sen@@ ate , saying , &quot; it &apos;s strange that holly@@ wood has more access to can@@ adi@@ an leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors than can@@ adi@@ an citizens do . why don &apos;t we use gi@@ th@@ u@@ b to show them what a citi@@ z@@ en-@@ developed bill might look like ? &quot;
we give them lots of instru@@ ction , and we never ever de@@ cei@@ ve them .
and back in the 198@@ 0s , when we wanted the money for the l@@ h@@ c from the u.k. government , mar@@ gar@@ et th@@ at@@ cher , at the time , said , &quot; if you guys can explain , in language a poli@@ tician can understand , what the hell it is that you &apos;re doing , you can have the money .
in my country , i have seen how the coun@@ ci@@ l of islam@@ ist groups and chri@@ sti@@ an groups came together , not as a government initiative , but they came together on their own initiative to establi@@ sh contact and dialo@@ gue in times where things were pretty low-@@ key ten@@ sion .
even better than short bul@@ let points are no bul@@ let points .
if you look at it , you &apos;re going to be blind , either tempor@@ arily or perman@@ ently .
when one morning , years after the cr@@ ash , i ste@@ pped onto stone and the under@@ side of my left foot felt the f@@ lash of cold , ner@@ ves at last a@@ wake , it was ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating , a g@@ ust of s@@ now .

and through their work over the last years , this is not only happening that this house is opening , but it &apos;s being supported by many fac@@ tions of the society who never would have supported it .
the one that &apos;s the most important is the in@@ er@@ ti@@ a or the resist@@ ance to motion .
information that we copy from person to person , by im@@ itation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clo@@ th@@ es , by doing things .
and so , there are always — — there are always people wor@@ rying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinn@@ ing .
and this happens constantly in the writing .
i &apos;d like to start by introdu@@ cing you to someone whose life has been changed by a market@@ place fu@@ el@@ ed by reputation .
anyway , for now , anyone involved in getting these results , thank you . i think this pro@@ ved these goals are worth it .
a , in fact , is more central , and this can be form@@ alized mathema@@ tically .
and little did i know , that you should listen to eight year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i che@@ cked the repor@@ ts on this one .
my father was a city wor@@ ker all of his life , and my mother was a sta@@ y-@@ at@@ -@@ home mom .
no one else will do ...
are the students right ? is it still two types of countries ?
and so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .
all the sen@@ ior staf@@ f got together , and i later found out what happened .
but we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future .
some of the technologies we &apos;ve been talking about , you invented them , or at least revolution@@ ized the way that they &apos;re used .
now i &apos;m going to add some of that fer@@ ro@@ fluid to that mag@@ net .
and maybe these heal@@ ing zones can spr@@ in@@ kle a map , little dots on a map .
yes , you can , and i &apos;ll show you in a second how to do that .
but then what &apos;s going to happen is , it will create a field .
that &apos;s what most of electricity and the energy in the world is .
and if you wonder why this is interesting at all , you have to see the rest of sau@@ di arab@@ ia because it &apos;s a country which is stri@@ ctly divided between the sex@@ es .
but with that , we were going to ga@@ in freedom : freedom to hi@@ re the teachers that we knew were going to be effective ; freedom to control the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um so that we &apos;re not doing lesson 1.@@ 2 on page five , no ; and freedom to control a budget , to spend money where it matters , not how a distri@@ ct or a state says you have to do it .
such a service simply do not exist .
he &apos;s standing on the left with his pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush in one hand and his pal@@ et@@ te in the other .
so , water is a very important aspect .
thank you all very much .
it &apos;s an amazing notion that color could be used .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
what you &apos;re doing is you really s@@ wing your leg and cat@@ ch the fall , stand up again , s@@ wing your leg and cat@@ ch the fall .
one of my twitter friends can type only with his to@@ es .
that &apos;s another story we won &apos;t even get into .
so where &apos;s the link between these two things ?
ja@@ y walker : you know , econom@@ ists love to talk about the stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty of people who buy l@@ ot@@ tery ti@@ ckets . but i suspe@@ ct you &apos;re making the ex@@ act same er@@ ror you &apos;re acc@@ using those people of , which is the er@@ ror of value .
so ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le was very interested in watching how the cra@@ f@@ ts@@ men around him worked .
who would have thought ? oh my g@@ os@@ h .
obviously , he &apos;s had his vas@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ y because his hot@@ dog is half e@@ aten , and he was very happy .
scott kle@@ mmer : so bush imag@@ ined that in the future , you &apos;d wear a camera right in the center of your head .
everything is very efficient .
so that &apos;s what led me to alzheimer &apos;s . i started reading about alzheimer &apos;s and tried to famili@@ ari@@ ze myself with the research , and at the same time when i was in the -- i was reading in the medical library one day , and i read this article about something called &quot; pur@@ ine deri@@ va@@ tives . &quot;
and the way we do this is we basically place this through the so@@ ft tissue , and kind of pun@@ ch it into the hard bone , into the tu@@ ch@@ us -- that &apos;s a technical term -- and aspi@@ rate about 10 m@@ ls of bone mar@@ row out , each time , with a sy@@ rin@@ ge .
my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times when the west has tried to do it themselves , and we haven &apos;t succe@@ e@@ ded .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of pois@@ ons that come out of these har@@ m@@ ful alg@@ al blo@@ oms : sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning , fish ci@@ gu@@ at@@ era , di@@ ar@@ r@@ hei@@ c sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neuro@@ toxic sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning , paraly@@ tic sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning .
country 2 , that has fewer tele@@ phones , is china .

in ma@@ dur@@ ai , a reward that is mo@@ dest in north american standards , same deal . a bunch of games , three levels of re@@ wards .
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .
she was very t@@ all , i would say .
so his thought was that f@@ loo@@ ding in the north of africa actually brought those con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous trees down tens of thousands of years ago , and what resul@@ ted was this remarkable adap@@ tation to this unique desert environment .
so you can think of fox@@ o as being like a building super@@ inten@@ dent .
well , i &apos;m sta@@ ying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while i &apos;ve been speaking , you have been scan@@ ned .
from flu@@ tes to golf cour@@ ses to sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age -- that was a genius link .
so what does all this add up to ?
that &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
and how they &apos;re distribu@@ ted really contribu@@ tes to their under@@ lying function .
no , it wasn &apos;t . the high@@ light of 2012 , so clearly , was the dis@@ covery of the higgs bos@@ on .
how would you answer the obje@@ ction ?
a very common public design done in the &apos; 5@@ 0s .
i &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that i &apos;ve done of some of the other fol@@ ks i didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not possible to feed , clo@@ the and house us all and have us live de@@ cent lives .
and so , we refle@@ ct until we can sort of see that mo@@ ther@@ ly expression in all beings .
what are the planet@@ ary boun@@ dar@@ ies within which we can saf@@ ely oper@@ ate ? &quot;
we have a world class g@@ aller@@ y because we believe that poor kids need a world class g@@ aller@@ y , so i designed this thing .
right , so here you want -- entrepren@@ eur@@ s by definition are people who are leaving something else , starting a new world over here , creating and putting their life@@ blood into this kind of thing .
and bed nets are a great tool .
if you pick this person , the only friend they have to nom@@ in@@ ate is this person , who , by construction , must have at least two and typ@@ ically more friends .
it &apos;s sort of an ex@@ cer@@ pt from a quote of hers .
he said , &quot; i am a fir@@ m belie@@ ver in the people .
let me give it a little weap@@ on on the tail here , so it can fight .
there is hurt , here , that cannot be fixed by b@@ and-@@ aids or po@@ etry .
and in 19@@ 17 , se@@ ars -- i want to get this exactly right .
here &#91; among the poor@@ est &#93; , population is growing .
i thought it would be cre@@ ep@@ y to hear my own voice coming from a computer .
she f@@ ought off the hy@@ en@@ as with that stick .
anony@@ mous is this group of people that prote@@ sted , very fam@@ ously , sci@@ ent@@ ology .
people built one bi@@ on@@ ic@@ le after another .
and i finally worked it all out .
this is a level of pain that &apos;s only known to other people who suffer vas@@ cular mi@@ gra@@ ines .
what are these for happiness ?
but i think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously across fron@@ ti@@ ers right across the world .
you can &apos;t miss it when i tell you what &apos;s there .
and there is a 100 billion cli@@ cks per day .
this is ki@@ ber@@ a , kenya , one of the largest sl@@ ums of africa .
the dan@@ ish cho@@ col@@ ate company anth@@ on berg opened a so@@ -@@ called &quot; gener@@ ous store &quot; in cop@@ enha@@ gen .
i said , &quot; well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i can &apos;t drive . sort of can &apos;t walk either .
or they burn the pla@@ stics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
and bre@@ ath@@ ability is good .
so it &apos;s very much like in a holly@@ wood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wir@@ es , and then they take the wir@@ es away digit@@ ally so you &apos;re flying through the air .
you cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem .
he ki@@ cked a child , grab@@ s the child like this and i let it go .
and this happened by acci@@ dent that i got this right on axis with the din@@ ing room table .

the maximum efficient distance for re@@ generation is only about one centi@@ meter .
could you say &quot; av@@ un@@ cular &quot; ? &quot; av@@ unclear . &quot;
so wh@@ il@@ st inv@@ enting the technology that would us@@ her in the tele@@ communications revolution , watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system em@@ it@@ ted powerful radio wa@@ ves .
this is what happened in japan two years ago , in northern japan .
afghanistan does not pose an exist@@ enti@@ al threat to global security .
now a few months after this site launched , the fo@@ unders heard about something interesting , and it actually didn &apos;t surprise them .
this increase in life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy is the remarkable product of culture -- the cru@@ ci@@ ble that holds science and technology and wi@@ de@@ -@@ scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being .
it &apos;s said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual .
in &quot; the des@@ cent of man , &quot; charles dar@@ win wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from , why do we have it .
i could picture them as real in my mind , and there i run it , test it and improve it .
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they don &apos;t really transform what it is to be human .
when you go to tanz@@ ania , listen carefully , because i &apos;m sure you will hear of the various open@@ ings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for your@@ selves .
and this is , i think , the cool@@ est thing , and it &apos;s even lower tech than what you just saw , if you can imagine such a thing . here it is .
throughout her life she had been he@@ ating water with fire@@ wood , and she had hand wash@@ ed laun@@ dry for seven children .
five is a bit much . probably four is rational .
he argu@@ ed -- and it &apos;s now a fair@@ ly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our clos@@ est living rela@@ tives , the great ap@@ es , and humans today , then maybe those behaviors were present in the ap@@ e-@@ like , human@@ -@@ like an@@ c@@ est@@ or some seven million years ago .
anyway , johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
and my experience is that , when i &apos;m talking to her , with every second that pas@@ ses during our conversation , the feeling of love that bin@@ ds us is bringing us closer and closer together .
americans on both sides care about global poverty and aids , and on so many human@@ it@@ arian issues , liber@@ als and ev@@ ange@@ lic@@ als are actually natural al@@ lies , and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems .
i vent@@ ure there are many in this room .
and like our relationship with the ecosystem we &apos;re always search@@ ing for equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in how we divi@@ de ourselves across the planet .
and in fact , custom@@ ers of the model s are sort of comp@@ eting with each other to try to get the high@@ est possible range .
i called my parents up .
he &apos;s sort of a hom@@ er simp@@ son with fin@@ s .
and you make if from li@@ thi@@ um . that re@@ action at the bottom , that &apos;s li@@ thi@@ um 6 , plus a neutr@@ on , will give you more heli@@ um , plus tri@@ ti@@ um .
and so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
this woman will exp@@ ose her@@ self to toxic phosph@@ or@@ ous , rele@@ ase four pounds of toxic lead into her childr@@ ens &apos; environment , which is from cop@@ per .
i ask my wife to come , and i tell her , you have to see that .
thank you very much .
astro@@ lab@@ es , like every technology , do evol@@ ve over time .
the stories can be anything , and some of them are actually true .
and for us , i mean it &apos;s really kind of a very strange thing , but the moments in the hall that the bu@@ zz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin , very similar to the par@@ ting of cur@@ tains or the rais@@ ing of a chan@@ deli@@ er , the walls will just ex@@ u@@ de this glo@@ w , tempor@@ arily ste@@ aling attention from the stage .
no , not everything f@@ its so ti@@ di@@ ly into the paradigm , but that does not mean there &apos;s not something going on at the high@@ est possible levels .
and you can see the start of it here .
we need to rein@@ vent the whole model of scientific research .
and this time , i don &apos;t like it , i didn &apos;t want to give into it , but there &apos;s a difference between a non-@@ stop swim and a sta@@ ged swim .
there &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
so rather than rein@@ vent the whe@@ el , i began studying other professi@@ ons to see if anybody had .
all of industry was in play , as inv@@ e@@ stors flo@@ cked to place their be@@ ts .
it &apos;s a little bit of a different story , this health aspect of light , than what i &apos;m telling you today .
this is at u@@ c santa barbara . look at these di@@ atom@@ s .
and i went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
for some of this kind of technology , ground center is a combination of design , which is cru@@ cially important .
i &apos;m convinced that in 30 years , when we look back on today and on how we raise and s@@ lau@@ ghter billions of animals to make our ham@@ bur@@ gers and our hand@@ ba@@ gs , we &apos;ll see this as being wa@@ ste@@ ful and indeed crazy .
very impres@@ sive .
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
it &apos;s about ultra@@ -@@ low cost .
he thro@@ ws the first mate to the ground .
epi@@ ph@@ any hit me . something hit me .
so am@@ anda came j@@ et@@ -@@ la@@ g@@ ged , she &apos;s using the arm , and everything goes wrong .
the only difference was , their mistakes were in the secret fil@@ ing c@@ ab@@ in@@ ets .
but he made me feel i was telling him a fab@@ ul@@ ous story .
and , by the end , you &apos;re going to see clu@@ sters of ob@@ ese and non-@@ ob@@ ese individuals within the network .
you practice ancient bal@@ in@@ ese arts .
a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aver@@ sion for the whole idea of the city , city life , and everything connected with it .
most people make in@@ expensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
something always seems to stop us .
i tried to em@@ ulate him , but i realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes . &quot;
but it &apos;s not legal to transp@@ ort the books from spa@@ in to la@@ tin america .
and everywhere too , you can see a pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of time ban@@ ks and parallel curren@@ cies , people using smart technologies to link up all the resources fre@@ ed up by the market -- people , buildings , land -- and lin@@ king them to wh@@ om@@ ever has got the most comp@@ elling needs .
the first is , can you dele@@ te these app@@ s , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
so , we designed a system here of eight cur@@ ves that could be sw@@ apped , very similar to that hous@@ ing project i showed you , and we could recom@@ bine those together , so that we always had er@@ gon@@ om@@ ic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way .
hope is here . yes we can .
or you could go into three-dimensional art .
j@@ m : now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
i said , &quot; and when we review this , won &apos;t you do better ? &quot;
it makes me very popular as well .
amazing number of people think they &apos;re ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f .
let &apos;s take cotton .
and before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxi@@ ous about feeling anxi@@ ous .
the controll@@ ers are , of course , part of the experience , so you cannot do away with it .
but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
so this is what i looked like by the end .
two things are va@@ stly under@@ esti@@ ma@@ ted : dying by dro@@ w@@ ning and dying by asth@@ ma . why ?
a be@@ e@@ fal@@ o is a bu@@ ff@@ alo@@ -@@ cattle hy@@ bri@@ d .
der@@ art@@ u tu@@ l@@ u was ready to hang it up and re@@ ti@@ re from the sport , but she decided she &apos;d go for broke and try for one last big pay@@ day in the mar@@ qu@@ ee event , the new york city mar@@ ath@@ on .
and they go up to the c@@ ath lab and bo@@ om , bo@@ om , bo@@ om get rid of the c@@ lot .
but what i find really fascinating is what happens when archite@@ cts and plan@@ ners leave and these places become appropri@@ ated by people , like here in chan@@ dig@@ ar@@ h , india , the city which has been completely designed by the architect le cor@@ bu@@ si@@ er .
i t@@ ap@@ ed it to the top left hand of my table , and as you can see , it &apos;s still there .
and we did .
and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , &quot; okay , are there differences in the type of fox@@ o genes among people who live a really long time ? &quot; and there are .
s@@ w : and how about those cat@@ s ?
it &apos;s the fra@@ me@@ work onto which the other parts are bol@@ ted .
we sli@@ p into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone .
for the children of today , for tomorrow &apos;s child : as never again , now is the time .
so i cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ f a lot . i also crow@@ d@@ sur@@ f a lot .
we had 25 mothers who came reg@@ ularly after school to study .
we call ourselves the sle@@ ep@@ y man ban@@ jo boys .
they were looking at them and they said , &quot; one &apos;s got 17 teeth , and the biggest one &apos;s got 12 teeth .
but she also found many in@@ stances in which people escap@@ ed the prisoner &apos;s dilemma ; in fact , the tragedy of the common@@ s is a multi@@ player prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
all right , how many swe@@ dish decisi@@ on@@ ma@@ kers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.@@ s@@ .@@ -@@ based services , like , you know , run windows or os@@ x , or use facebook or lin@@ ke@@ d@@ in , or store their data in clou@@ ds like ic@@ loud or sky@@ drive or d@@ rop@@ box , or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support ?
ok , that &apos;s pretty wild . what is it ?
the first wish is to use the epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy responsive neuro@@ stimul@@ ator , called r@@ ns , for responsive neuro@@ stimul@@ ator -- that &apos;s a brilliant acr@@ ony@@ m -- for the treatment of other brain dis@@ orders .
and we knew it , all 50 people on the boat , we all knew this was it , this was our time .
it fun@@ ds research all over the place .
one-@@ of-@@ a-@@ kind r &amp; amp ; b group naturally 7 be@@ at@@ boxes an orchestr@@ a &apos;s worth of instru@@ ments to gro@@ o@@ ve through their smo@@ oth single , &quot; fly baby . &quot;
and put your project in that context .
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been impro@@ ved , and very simple things turned out .
it gets very expensive to do this research .
and vi@@ tal@@ -@@ signs monit@@ oring to prevent sudden car@@ dia@@ c death .
it should be not@@ ed , of course , that the united states and the u.k. are the next in line .
translate this into adult language .
and by the way , the reason the kit@@ tens here are orange and these are green is because that &apos;s a bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ cent gene from cor@@ al , while this is from j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
think of all the ro@@ les that people play in argu@@ ments .
tell me about you . &quot;
are these factors taken into consi@@ der@@ ation when land@@ -@@ use policy is decided ?
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law pl@@ ot@@ ted here , which rel@@ ates to density of information , but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers , their use , internet , etc . and what &apos;s important is it just goes straight up through the top of the cur@@ ve , and has no real limits to it . now try and contr@@ ast these .
and i can tell you two great stories .
three things had combined to lay him low .
the grand c@@ any@@ on is really simple .
but this whole effort is gener@@ ated , is driven , by it as well because that is how we &apos;re gather@@ ing all this information , and lin@@ king it , and integr@@ ating it together .
the pattern is that those people , every one of them i looked at , who was a mur@@ der@@ er , and was a seri@@ al killer , had damage to their or@@ bit@@ al cortex , which is right above the eyes , the or@@ bits , and also the inter@@ ior part of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be .
i was raised on &quot; free to be you and me &quot; -- hip@@ -@@ ho@@ p -- not as many woo@@ ho@@ os for hip@@ -@@ ho@@ p in the house .
this kind of traff@@ i@@ cking , in nar@@ co@@ tics , in humans , in weap@@ ons , god for@@ bi@@ d , in weap@@ ons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global common@@ s .
of all the nar@@ ra@@ tives their fe@@ ars wrote , they respon@@ ded only to the most lu@@ rid , the most vi@@ vid , the one that was eas@@ i@@ est for their imag@@ in@@ ations to picture : can@@ ni@@ b@@ als .
imagine that it &apos;s one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system .
in this case -- the map of the world at night by nasa -- they &apos;re dark literally because of l@@ ack of electricity .
so ex@@ it the rock star .
this is the oce@@ an@@ ic whit@@ e@@ ti@@ p shark , an animal that is consi@@ dered the fourth most dangerous species , if you pay attention to such li@@ sts .
but if the god became un@@ ru@@ ly and began to ask for human sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , the ig@@ bo@@ s would destro@@ y the god .
it won lots of a@@ wards .
if i cr@@ ank the handle , all the wo@@ ol goes inside .
one day in re@@ hab someone , started talking about sur@@ fing and all these guys who &apos;d never sur@@ f@@ ed before said , &quot; hey , let &apos;s go . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing , and then compare that to some natural systems .
and this would then com@@ bine two basic func@@ tion@@ alities : ill@@ um@@ ination and wir@@ eless data trans@@ mission .
now thousands of progra@@ mm@@ ers today are finding better jobs this way , because stack over@@ flow and the reputation d@@ ash@@ bo@@ ards provide a pri@@ c@@ eless window into how someone really beha@@ ves , and what their pe@@ ers think of them .
there was no metaph@@ or . was it a dat@@ ab@@ ase ?
and instead i wanted to ask , &quot; how are the different task groups inter@@ dependent ? &quot;
and for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happ@@ ily ever after .
we don &apos;t want to show the video games with the par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a . no ar@@ ca@@ de no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
so for the deep sea squid h@@ unt , i pro@@ posed using an op@@ tical l@@ ure atta@@ ched to a camera plat@@ form with no th@@ ru@@ sters , no motors , just a bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ powered camera , and the only ill@@ um@@ ination coming from red light that &apos;s invisible to most deep@@ -@@ sea animals that are adap@@ ted to see pri@@ mar@@ ily blue .
so he went to find them . they said , &quot; we can give you a fran@@ ch@@ ise on this for 3,000 bucks . &quot;
and for me , for us , we pus@@ h@@ ed the fight right over the edge , and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day : &quot; hey , bud@@ dy , it was a hell of a ride . &quot;
now , he tries the e again . that ch@@ ord doesn &apos;t work .
and they looked back at islam@@ ic tradition , they saw that there are proble@@ matic aspects , but they &apos;re not the core of the religion , so maybe they can be re-@@ understood , and the kor@@ an can be r@@ er@@ e@@ ad in the modern world .
which is curious as we debate all this stuff . but as you think of coal , this is what bur@@ ned whe@@ at kern@@ els look like . not entirely unlike coal .
so the people looking for good jobs are going to fa@@ il .
working with the harvard business school , you &apos;ll see this example when you talk about minim@@ um pay@@ ment : if you spent 6@@ 2 dollars for a me@@ al , the longer you take to pay out that lo@@ an , you see , over a period of time using the minim@@ um pay@@ ment it &apos;s 99 dollars and 17 cents .
non-@@ zero-@@ sum games in which cor@@ rel@@ ations can be positive , ok .
and this particular pain@@ ting , i think , represents the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le , the pe@@ ak , of that clinical era .
interest@@ ingly , it &apos;s happened almost entirely without media cover@@ age .
but we &apos;ve worked through some of those , but we &apos;ve still got real problems in wash@@ ing@@ ton .
and what i pos@@ it and what positive psych@@ ology pos@@ its is that if we study what is mer@@ ely average , we will remain mer@@ ely average .
and ever since those results came out , poli@@ cy@@ ma@@ kers , edu@@ cat@@ ors , researchers from around the world what &apos;s behind the success of those systems .
maybe i should cl@@ ari@@ fy it .
it &apos;s the col@@ dest , high@@ est , win@@ dies@@ t and dri@@ est continent on earth .
yeah ! i already have fibon@@ acc@@ i f@@ ans here .
we ga@@ ther together these physici@@ sts in los al@@ am@@ os to see what they &apos;ll build .
it bo@@ ils away in the middle at 150 million degrees .
you can ask for help !
i know -- i don &apos;t know how we got into this position .
and then , of course , design is never done .
when we think about actual use , you &apos;ll notice that fire@@ fly has a single bas@@ sin@@ et .
and it &apos;s basically a meat lo@@ cker .
it &apos;s got all the u@@ ps and the dow@@ ns of movements .
thank you very much . thank you . thank you .
scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to start my own bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al .
since time im@@ memor@@ ial , there have been auth@@ ors .
it &apos;s some strange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot;
and we still don &apos;t know why this is happening .
audience : i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human em@@ br@@ yo , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
we start with an ob@@ servation which , in my mind , has become clear@@ er and clear@@ er in the past few years , that any personal information can become sensitive information .
and in order to get these kinds of compu@@ tations started right , you need some kind of in@@ put , a kind of se@@ ed .
well , there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of u@@ ta@@ h that are ben@@ ding their brains to try to figure out what the tar@@ a@@ hum@@ ara have known forever .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
i have the privi@@ lege of being a partner with the monterey bay aqu@@ arium .
you know , students are divided up , refle@@ cting the belief that only some children can achieve worl@@ d-@@ class standards .
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cool@@ er .
because we live in such a no@@ is@@ y world .
i was really fri@@ gh@@ tened at first , but i cal@@ m@@ ly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn &apos;t seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-@@ ti@@ mer and ran back and forth .
we believe that this initiative requ@@ ires great political will , and we &apos;ll have to al@@ ign the financial sector , as well as the ic@@ t sector , and really even the under@@ lying legal fra@@ me@@ work .
so , the approach that we took was the other way around .
i labor@@ ed in that vin@@ e@@ y@@ ard for a quar@@ ter century before making my way to a little k@@ ing@@ dom of the just in up@@ state south carolina , a metho@@ di@@ st-@@ aff@@ ili@@ ated institution of higher learning called wofford college .
the third world is connected , we are connected .
and then they &apos;re going to mer@@ ge .
so that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a na@@ sty ki@@ ck@@ back .
she got a support network .
e@@ w : it was like it was te@@ asing us , doing a kind of f@@ an dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such te@@ asing appe@@ ar@@ ances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wo@@ wed us .
and she would be there , you know , kind of talking with the class , you know , talking about the , you know , the exist@@ enti@@ al fu@@ ti@@ li@@ ty of life , you know .
mexico has cancer .
and i brought a little se@@ gment to give you of du@@ ke bra@@ dy &apos;s &quot; canopy rap . &quot;
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
d@@ h : i touched it , bar@@ ry . that should be enough .
it &apos;s the great art tatum -- dp : art tatum .
it was obvious to me to do another work .
simple . roman@@ tic love is very simple .
in fact , in my view , there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that africa &apos;s farmers have to bear .
and this is reali@@ stic . and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has great@@ ly em@@ powered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them .
i can &apos;t get my father in it@@ al@@ y to work on the internet .
certainly when i &apos;m traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let &apos;s say , a hal@@ f-@@ kor@@ e@@ an , hal@@ f-@@ german young woman living in paris .
i showed this slide to lar@@ ry page , who just jo@@ ined our board .
so this project also , because of its involved prac@@ tic@@ ing and learning , doing something over and over again , this project also has a lesson , which is , if you want to do something well , there &apos;s no sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for practice , practice , practice .
so what seems like a very cl@@ un@@ ky product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
now , a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls is tiny .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of , like concer@@ tos and symph@@ on@@ ies , but even the most ambi@@ tious ma@@ ster@@ piece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fra@@ gi@@ le and personal moment -- like this one from the be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ oli@@ n concer@@ to .
he had to come up with new ideas , new things that would be hard to copy .
or just like you ? really ?
and , as i stood there , looking at the happy lam@@ b that i had just de@@ fil@@ ed -- but it looked ok .
this is a heli@@ cop@@ ter medi@@ c giving c@@ p@@ r to a soldier who had been shot in the head .

what happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
and it &apos;s all about this question , in a very arti@@ stic and indi@@ re@@ ct kind of way .
but in west african music , the &quot; one &quot; is thought of as the end of the phr@@ ase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
robo@@ ger anima@@ du : in big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place .
so , this is indeed made of human bone tissue .
born in southern germany to a stable and well-@@ respe@@ cted middle class family , his ob@@ s@@ ession with gam@@ ing as a te@@ en@@ a@@ ger led him to hac@@ king .
we don &apos;t know which experts to believe anymore .
and also , there are other ways of ac@@ tiv@@ ating fox@@ o that don &apos;t even invol@@ ve insu@@ lin or ig@@ f-@@ 1 that might even be sa@@ fer .
scientists , you know , made world war ii as we know it quite possible .
the children were killed on the spot .
we know that damage to the brain occur@@ s after death and during free@@ zing .
she lives in a small village outside la@@ h@@ ore , pakistan .
but no , in our mind up there are a h@@ ost of things going on that we don &apos;t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with sel@@ fl@@ ess@@ ness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one &apos;s self in the presence of another .
and yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the star@@ light .
so this is the gulf of mexico , spar@@ kl@@ ing place full of fish .
thank you .
and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental dis@@ order , and the drugs that are used today are largely empi@@ ri@@ cal .
thank you very much .
what are they doing ?
in fact , you can &apos;t even take the name of the country for granted , because the name &quot; india &quot; comes from the river indu@@ s , which flows in pakistan .
we can push it up : the forces become more frag@@ mented ; there is more of them , but they are weak@@ er .
how can we have the good stuff without the bad ?
but i &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as mar@@ vel@@ ous -- your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is .
why ? because during conflict economic policy typ@@ ically de@@ teri@@ or@@ ates .
do we have a solution ?
how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ?
pun@@ e has 5,000 building sites .
so this cultural complex surrounding death , the ritual en@@ ac@@ tment of the end of life , has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of tor@@ a@@ ja &apos;s landscape .
and i &apos;m standing there with two te@@ stic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
there isn &apos;t anything wrong with nu@@ ke .
aims is now a pro@@ ven model .
he &apos;s going to re@@ ti@@ re on 4@@ 4 percent of what he ear@@ ned while he was working .
you &apos;re going to see a lot of ima@@ gery , and it &apos;s not always connected to what i &apos;m talking about , so i need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other .
but fortunately , they never had to use it .
and it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
and some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sc@@ ulp@@ ture , something that would keep the sc@@ ulp@@ ture fres@@ h and ever@@ -@@ changing , by just creating the media that the sc@@ ulp@@ ture is made of .
so , if you &apos;ve got india here , when the front is up above india you &apos;re into the sou@@ th@@ west mon@@ soon .
so the tree of life is normally diver@@ gence over time .
so i started that , and worked in his lab for a year , and found the results that i guess you &apos;d expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really , really im@@ pa@@ i@@ red the nervous system .
here &apos;s what the new main street looks like .
would you deserve to be killed ?
so my parents never found out about it .
in the u.k. we have an epidemic of facial in@@ ju@@ ries among young people .
and so the au@@ ction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; ban@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and-@@ so player . &quot;
and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says , &quot; what are those ? &quot;
words like equ@@ ality and fair@@ ness and the traditional elections , democracy , these are not really great terms yet .
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anti@@ ci@@ pate what that did and do things very differ@@ ently .
i was mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed .
for example , in bro@@ ther@@ ho@@ ods , fr@@ at@@ ern@@ al organi@@ zations , sor@@ orities , lo@@ cu@@ tions like &quot; the family of man , &quot; you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordin@@ arily be appropriate to close k@@ in .
and this still goes on as i think i told you last year .
well , we just put basically all the human res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory viruses on one chip , and we thre@@ w in her@@ p@@ es virus for good measure -- i mean , why not ?
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
and the ta@@ il@@ ings pon@@ ds range in size up to 9@@ ,000 acr@@ es .
thank you very much .
so , my message to you fol@@ ks , from my three minutes , is that i appreciate the chance to share this with you . i will be back . i love being at ted .
who belie@@ ves they &apos;re at the top 25 percent ?
that &apos;s 8 a.@@ m. sha@@ dows .
the ma@@ ster@@ y-@@ based population was a full standard de@@ vi@@ ation , or sig@@ ma , in achiev@@ ement sc@@ or@@ es better than the standard lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ based class , and the individual tu@@ tor@@ ing gives you 2 sig@@ ma impro@@ v@@ ement in performance .
when you pick up a piece of history like that , i think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science .
our dream is for our part@@ ners , our hus@@ b@@ ands , not to be given to us because of a hor@@ os@@ cope , because they &apos;ve been tested for hiv . &quot;
dou@@ g di@@ et@@ z is a technical person .
here &apos;s the larger point .
the average american used to be more than 20 times ri@@ cher than the average chinese .
his family was ki@@ cked out of their ap@@ art@@ ment , and the wel@@ f@@ are system was threat@@ ening to take away his kids .
ab@@ ra@@ ham lincoln realized there was one other ing@@ re@@ dient .
we &apos;re not the first ones to make paper . we &apos;re not the first ones to try to optimi@@ ze pac@@ king space , or to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , or to try to heat and cool a structure .
these black lines mark shi@@ pping lan@@ es in and out of the bay of fun@@ dy .
we &apos;re not mat@@ ching our resources to our pri@@ orities .
this view of the world is a con@@ sequence of having studied de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ ef@@ s .
that &apos;s really my thinking .
so while other kids were watching si@@ t@@ com@@ s and car@@ to@@ ons , i was watching very es@@ ot@@ eric docum@@ ent@@ aries made by and about women .
and so , i run on these , and have sho@@ cked half the world on these .
i think we may have lost something in our culture .
the other ti@@ tle that we launched is called &quot; secret pa@@ ths in the forest , &quot; which addres@@ ses the more fan@@ tas@@ y-@@ ori@@ ented , inner lives of girls .
and then that year , that year , 2008 , this is@@ af stat@@ ement from kab@@ u@@ l , afghanistan , september 17@@ th : &quot; general stanley mc@@ chr@@ ystal , com@@ man@@ der of international security as@@ si@@ stance forces in afghanistan , an@@ no@@ un@@ ced today is@@ af will not condu@@ ct offen@@ sive military oper@@ ations on the 21st of september . &quot;
for me , the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es that i have are really just new work projects that i &apos;ve launched .
what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
one and the same event has a level of descri@@ ption where it &apos;s neuro@@ biological , and another level of descri@@ ption where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single event , and that &apos;s how nature works . that &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to function caus@@ ally .
so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room and i thought it was a mon@@ ster .
what should you take home from all of this ?
in the disease example , we had to bear in mind two things , one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not .
and the re@@ cur@@ sion in some of these villages contin@@ ues down into very tiny sc@@ ales .
what happens is that the second this introdu@@ ction of in@@ cen@@ tive gets us so that instead of asking , &quot; what is my responsibility ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just there for oil ; we &apos;re there for lots of reasons .
or is it more likely that a rea@@ der of &quot; skep@@ tic &quot; did this with phot@@ os@@ ho@@ p ?
the chromosome is literally blo@@ wn apart .
but that sub@@ divi@@ des chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam and buddh@@ ism into many sub@@ groups , which was too deta@@ iled .
people have used this software to map everything from ro@@ ads to ri@@ vers , from schools to local businesses , and video stor@@ es to the corner store .
it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work , and it was used in a project where we could un@@ ra@@ vel that surface , and it was a fig@@ ur@@ ative idea that was going to be fol@@ ded and made into a very , kind of complex space .
this is my tattoo .
and we now have 1,@@ 400 volunte@@ ers on our ro@@ ster .
they did chicken pot p@@ ie , they did fri@@ ed chicken , and then they finally introduced chicken mc@@ nu@@ g@@ gets .
so i could not attra@@ ct her attention , but something , a thing , did .
the goo@@ d-@@ news stories in medicine are early dete@@ ction , early intervention .
you &apos;re not aware of this , but your eyes are always moving .
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
speaking of humans , there are currently 7 billion of us on earth .
so i started to say , &quot; hey , man , you are too much !
and every note , every beat , every s@@ lu@@ r , every ac@@ cent , every pe@@ d@@ al was perfect , because he played it for that room on that day .
the docum@@ entation of this animal goes back to the las@@ cau@@ x cave pain@@ t@@ ings .
this is only one vari@@ able .
but the truth is i &apos;ve spent every wa@@ king minute ne@@ arly since then ch@@ asing that vision .
you see 4@@ ,000 repres@@ ent@@ ative species , and you can see where we are .
and without giving you too much of a ti@@ ra@@ de , i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today : my 4@@ 4@@ th invention . no , that &apos;s not true either .
if a computer speech recogni@@ tion system is able to recognize what you &apos;re saying , then it sp@@ ells it out .
what we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic , and in many ways very de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized .
this is certainly not a cure for spin@@ al cor@@ d injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values .
and would come to the conclu@@ sion that that was when the ali@@ ens were taking him and giving him re@@ ct@@ al prob@@ es .
that is also very rob@@ ust -- what you find in systems like earth where there are am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds , but there is no life .
so the first one -- the most famous ap@@ poin@@ tment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
i looked at the image -- a picture &apos;s worth a thousand words .
i &apos;ve been ar@@ re@@ sted because i ref@@ used to pay a bri@@ be -- not in africa , actually .
that &apos;s really important .
and we only get the one chance : if we m@@ ess up our spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , we &apos;ve got no@@ where else to go .
the image at the top , what it doesn &apos;t -- if you look at it in detail , really what it is saying is you can wire this building .
we call it propa@@ ganda gar@@ den@@ ing .
we deter@@ mine how this will all end .
q@@ at@@ ar is no ex@@ ception to the region .
so when my mother used to take me to school , she thought i was at school , and i used to do a u@@ -@@ turn , when her back was turned , and run off and hi@@ de in the shed at the back of the garden .
so they have all the cri@@ teria that people normally like .
what it &apos;s about instead is finding the true belie@@ vers .
and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of testing our intui@@ tion was the big lesson i learned when i went back to the nur@@ ses to talk to them .
so what you see , that pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce , that high pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce with the valley , is the 2008 financial crisis .
that just over the last few years , what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it &apos;s not working the way that it used to .
well , for me cy@@ ma@@ tics is an almost magi@@ cal tool .
and that makes sense .
since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
this one does not have those b@@ ells and whist@@ les , but for p@@ ure func@@ tion@@ ality it &apos;s pretty much the best -- the ne@@ or@@ est 600 .
and there you see uni@@ fication , because matter particles , electr@@ ons and quar@@ ks , radiation particles , phot@@ ons , gravi@@ tons , are all built up from one enti@@ ty .
what i &apos;m going to do is to just give a few notes , and this is from a book i &apos;m prepar@@ ing called &quot; letters to a young scientist . &quot;
take a look at this one .
and the numbers are used to make decisions .
i kid you not .
so the reality is , is that the engine of corruption , well , it exists far beyond the shor@@ es of countries like equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al gu@@ in@@ ea or nigeria or tur@@ k@@ men@@ istan .
but this is what we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at , some@@ time in the 20@@ 3@@ 0s -- real electric power from fu@@ sion . thank you very much .
but you can imagine the bio@@ mass that represents .
but like every scientist , she appreci@@ ated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
so i didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
so 20@@ 30 looks like an infin@@ ity away .
it &apos;s 3d c@@ g@@ i , which is going to be very high-@@ quality , written in holly@@ wood by the wri@@ ters behind ben 10 and spider@@ man and star wars : cl@@ one wars .
what does that mean ?
on the other side of the political spectrum , the first time that i heard rush li@@ m@@ bau@@ gh re@@ fer to pres@@ identi@@ al hope@@ ful john ed@@ wards as the bre@@ ck girl i knew that he &apos;d made a direct hit .
and so , we &apos;re going to be on our own journey today from whe@@ at to eat , and in a few minutes we will try this , and see if we have succe@@ e@@ ded in ful@@ fil@@ ling this bak@@ er &apos;s mission of pulling out fla@@ vor .
we &apos;ve ob@@ served this in the labor@@ atory .
once a year , the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced , and we made tri@@ ps of about 45 days to reach the s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ house , bringing thousands of head of cattle , and about 20 days traveling back to reach our farm again .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
well that process has been a little bit bl@@ ur@@ red by the fact that not all europe@@ ans are that wel@@ coming -- but that &apos;s another discus@@ sion .
well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
well , we already saw an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally a couple of signs that they might .
you may have heard the military di@@ ct@@ um for the gather@@ ing of ar@@ mi@@ es : mar@@ ch to the sound of the guns .
in the state of texas , they reg@@ ulate 5@@ 15 professi@@ ons , from well-@@ dri@@ ll@@ er to fl@@ or@@ ist .
and this is really important in the m@@ ba classroom , because particip@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the grade .
so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself .
in the years that she walked , she edu@@ cated parents , mothers , fa@@ thers .
now , you &apos;re not going to hear a thing unless it h@@ its you .
it has zones of production , like afghanistan and colum@@ bia .
so this is a plate of nach@@ os .
and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der , we may be able to see whether nature uses this e@@ 8 pattern or a different one .
each of them is in a roman@@ tic relationship and each has a rich re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of friends .
i mean , ne@@ arly 100 percent . yeah , by sharing need@@ les .
you think that . it &apos;s not true , of course , but that &apos;s the media im@@ pression , and that &apos;s like what you get .
but what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those acci@@ d@@ ents happen often .
the way we sent dra@@ w@@ ings to japan : we used the magic computer in mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an that does car@@ ved models , and we used to make fo@@ am models , which that thing scan@@ ned .
so , to sum@@ mar@@ ize : prak@@ ash , in its five years of exist@@ ence , it &apos;s had an impact in multiple areas , ran@@ ging from basic neuroscience pla@@ stic@@ ity and learning in the brain , to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ thes@@ es like in auti@@ sm , the development of auton@@ om@@ ous machine vision systems , education of the under@@ graduate and graduate students , and most import@@ antly in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of childhood blin@@ dness .
so every insur@@ gent force that is on@@ going , every conflict that is on@@ going , it &apos;s going to look something like this .
ja@@ ke : &quot; ha@@ ha . s@@ lash i &apos;m watching this video with s@@ uns pla@@ yers trying to sho@@ ot with one eye . &quot;
we still haven &apos;t heard anything .
and the only b@@ old colors are the reds of the pan@@ ic butt@@ ons .
fast forward through the &apos; 9@@ 0s , we had the d@@ ot@@ com revolution and a temporary rise in produ@@ ctivity growth .
boy : the world peace game is serious .
they didn &apos;t -- they was not looking on me .
the exist@@ enti@@ al and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identi@@ ty is very important .
so three important ones that i can think of are per@@ si@@ st@@ ence , gra@@ da@@ tions in intensi@@ ty , and val@@ ence .
well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
we s@@ wis@@ s are famous for cho@@ col@@ ate and che@@ ese . our tra@@ ins run on time .
you o@@ we us two billion dollars . &quot;
so you &apos;re feeling the wind -- and this tremendous wind now that you &apos;re going to be feeling -- and you want to go per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular to the wind or down@@ wind , if you are in fact able to see where the b@@ last was in front of you .
it will continue .
i never once was asked for a don@@ ation , which had kind of been my mo@@ de , right .
when i bring the 10 living and self-@@ moving ben@@ ches in the ex@@ hibi@@ tion room , john was just bes@@ ide me , and was like , &quot; h@@ mm . h@@ mm . &quot;
today we talk of people as an as@@ set .
so that &apos;s my dir@@ ty little secret . don &apos;t tell anyone .
so we &apos;re just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see , and then only things that have started for@@ ming already are going to form , and then from then on it &apos;s going to go on .
and if the answer that we get from our calcul@@ ations agre@@ es with the values of those numbers that have been determined through deta@@ iled and pre@@ cise experim@@ entation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is .
i &apos;m not going to minim@@ ize those concer@@ ns .
and this is my favorite one . my mother used to say to me , &quot; just because your sister jum@@ ps in the lake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;
and here is the lat@@ est map . it was published just a little more than a week ago in the new york times , and it isn &apos;t looking good .
and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , i &apos;m really struck by the things that we have in common .
we &apos;ve got 90 po@@ st-@@ op patient years between us , and we haven &apos;t had a single problem .
the first is , &quot; to live , to er@@ r , to fall , to triumph and to re@@ create life out of life . &quot;
most agri@@ cultural emissions come from tropic@@ al de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , me@@ than@@ e from animals and rice fields , and ni@@ tr@@ ous oxide from over@@ -@@ ferti@@ li@@ zing .
and they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to , in the case of the geb@@ us@@ i , only a 15 percent chance . the tiny , little blue bar in the lower le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand corner pl@@ ots the cor@@ respon@@ ding stati@@ stic from united states and europe in the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century , and inclu@@ des all the deaths of both world wars . if the death rate in trib@@ al war@@ f@@ are had pre@@ vail@@ ed during the 20th century , there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million .
we really wanted to let them understand what the reali@@ ties of par@@ enting were in an honest way .
and this object knows , better than you and probably before you , what you really need .
it &apos;s not software .
so — thank you very much .
and again , the way in which that works as a building , for those of us who can enjoy the spaces , to live and visit there .
so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
every country has a con@@ tex@@ tual al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic drink . in fr@@ ance it &apos;s per@@ no@@ d .
the first day they all came back .
before &quot; jur@@ as@@ sic park , &quot; there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle , right ?
they have broken out of the exist@@ ing frame of victi@@ m and per@@ pet@@ r@@ ator .
kei@@ th bar@@ ry : brain magic
and that &apos;s the fun .
this is where we &apos;re head@@ ed in terms of global temperature ris@@ es , and if we keep on going the way we &apos;re going , we get a four@@ - or five-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade temperature rise by the end of this century .
well , you &apos;ve got mail .
so together , it &apos;s as if the rat can put a virtual grid of fir@@ ing lo@@ cations across its environment -- a bit like the la@@ titude and lon@@ git@@ u@@ de lines that you &apos;d find on a map , but using tri@@ an@@ gles .
gh : ok . c , g , b , a and e .
and she said , &quot; and where do , um , where do human women , like , where do women lay their eggs ? &quot;
how many people in the audience have the last name res@@ ni@@ ck like me ? raise your hand .
is this ? i have no idea . that &apos;s a shrimp .
you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it mel@@ ts it &apos;s able to main@@ tain one const@@ ant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply re@@ heat the p@@ ou@@ ch .
world without risk would not be worth living .
oh , and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child , ex@@ posed to speech , will acqui@@ re a human language , whereas the house pet won &apos;t , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly because of some in@@ na@@ te different between them .
this is not the isra@@ el@@ -@@ lov@@ es@@ -@@ iran . this is not my page .
here it is .
thank you .
and then i think , &quot; ah this is cool . &quot;
so origin@@ ally i was going to go to india .
they love nam@@ i@@ bia for its beautiful dun@@ es , that are even t@@ aller than the empi@@ re state building .
and then i did a law school for lo@@ y@@ ol@@ a in down@@ town l@@ .@@ a .
z@@ ach and i have always been fascinated ob@@ ser@@ ving unexpected things like this .
for me , that is the power of girls .
he emplo@@ yed 200 people .
and we read every once in while about these crazy law@@ su@@ its , like the guy in the distri@@ ct of colum@@ bia who su@@ ed his dry cle@@ an@@ ers for 5@@ 4 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants .
the dry air is really good for teles@@ cop@@ es , and also , the cloud cover is below the sum@@ mit of these mountains so that the teles@@ cop@@ es have about 300 days of clear sk@@ ies .
so every time you down@@ load a fi@@ le , each me@@ gab@@ y@@ te is a l@@ um@@ p of coal .
but keep in mind that this was a gr@@ ass@@ roots movement .
i alter@@ nat@@ ed between living in a van and cou@@ ch sur@@ fing with friends .
well , you know , in the middle &apos; 60s , the first anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts came out . to@@ fran@@ il was the first .
the teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they domin@@ ate the leagu@@ e by the time they &apos;re done .
it &apos;s between buildings .
so , it &apos;s not about sl@@ apping s@@ kins , anymore , on a technology .
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky , and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories .
none of us , bon@@ ob@@ o or human , can possibly even imagine ?
they talked about the will@@ ing@@ ness to say , &quot; i love you &quot; first , the will@@ ing@@ ness to do something where there are no guar@@ an@@ te@@ es , the will@@ ing@@ ness to brea@@ the through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammo@@ gra@@ m .
there &apos;s been wonderful news also about studying women , finally , in heart disease .
we only have a million galaxies , right ?
only the eg@@ g of the par@@ asi@@ te will be in@@ ser@@ ted into the body flu@@ i@@ ds of the ap@@ hi@@ d .
work : enga@@ ging in activi@@ ties that are mean@@ ing@@ ful and sa@@ tis@@ fying .
the produ@@ ctive mar@@ gin in our governments &apos; search for re@@ venue does not lie in the dom@@ esti@@ c economy , it lies with international don@@ ors .
now they have started writing their sig@@ nature .
and in fact , if you speak to people who are on long-@@ term war@@ far@@ in , it is a serious com@@ promise to your quality of life .
they are not beautiful and don &apos;t kill anybody .
so let &apos;s take a closer look at rule number 30 here .
maybe there &apos;s an inno@@ c@@ ence to it .
and guess what -- they solved the problem .
and as you all know , boys are five times more likely than girls to be lab@@ el@@ ed as having attention de@@ fi@@ c@@ it dis@@ order -- and therefore we drug them with ri@@ tal@@ in .
and i was this weird , sensitive kid , who couldn &apos;t really do it , but i had to do it .
there are extreme pres@@ sur@@ es .
we thought this was a good story .
but after the stir@@ ling engine , ot@@ to came along , and also , he didn &apos;t inv@@ ent the inter@@ n@@ al com@@ bu@@ sti@@ on engine , he just re@@ fin@@ ed it .
kb : i told you i &apos;d have the last lau@@ gh .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
really , really successful businesses -- google is great , great technological success , but it &apos;s also based on a very good psych@@ ological insight : people believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else .
so we will be bringing dar@@ fur@@ i re@@ bel groups , the northern cy@@ pri@@ ots and the southern cy@@ pri@@ ots , re@@ bel@@ s from ac@@ e@@ h , and awful long laun@@ dry list of cha@@ otic confli@@ cts around the world .
i mean , it &apos;s the most eth@@ ical swe@@ et@@ en@@ er , and you know , it &apos;s a dynamic and fun swe@@ et@@ en@@ er .
behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance is really a combination of psych@@ ology and economics , trying to understand the money mistakes people make .
and they go , &quot; what , what do you mean ? &quot;
and he didn &apos;t mean the comfort of a five-@@ course dinner as opposed to a one-@@ course me@@ al , but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .
we &apos;re pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it .
give it a little push -- this becomes a r@@ hom@@ bus .
not only have i tried four times , but the greatest swimm@@ ers in the world have been trying since 19@@ 50 , and it &apos;s still never been done .
it looked at the inter@@ section of race and gender in contemporary american art .
or in 200@@ 9 , my great friend , general stanley mc@@ chr@@ ystal , who said that he was &quot; k@@ ne@@ e-@@ deep in the decisi@@ ve year . &quot;
sb : so@@ ap , yeah . what else do you see ?
s@@ k : oh yeah . most of those were spe@@ cs by the teachers .
the ability of one to affect many is sc@@ aling exponenti@@ ally , and it &apos;s sc@@ aling for good and it &apos;s sc@@ aling for evil .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
but one of the things we &apos;re dis@@ cover@@ ing is that wind , like solar , is an actually rela@@ tively di@@ l@@ ute source of energy .
you know , this project for me is a way for me to bridge that ga@@ p and remember everything that i &apos;ve done .
it leaves 25 or 30 percent for oil , gas , coal , nuclear , or whatever .
you don &apos;t vaccin@@ ate a few children .
yet .
you &apos;ve all learned that in school -- how small the earth is compared to the immen@@ se universe .
be@@ at@@ rice ga@@ ku@@ ba has created 200 jobs from her flo@@ wer business in rwand@@ a .
people agree that pain@@ t@@ ings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures deter@@ mine a uni@@ for@@ mit@@ y of a@@ es@@ the@@ tic taste .
one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
unlike fin@@ s and blu@@ es , which dis@@ per@@ se into the tem@@ per@@ ate and tropic@@ al oceans , the h@@ ump@@ bac@@ ked whales con@@ gre@@ gate in local traditional bre@@ eding grounds , so they can make a sound that &apos;s a little higher in frequency , bro@@ a@@ der@@ -@@ band and more complicated .
this molecule will soon leave our ben@@ ches and go into a small star@@ tu@@ p company called ten@@ sh@@ a therap@@ eu@@ tics .
it &apos;s extremely clear water , because there &apos;s har@@ dly any plan@@ kt@@ on .
even the simpl@@ est animal we think of , something like an inse@@ ct , and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine .
our second type of er@@ ror is a fal@@ se negative .
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not sl@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
it was ma@@ i@@ read &apos;s sister .
but i ad@@ ded wea@@ ther@@ van@@ es on both sides to show that they cover all dire@@ ctions .
the blue there is india .
is biology special ?
so you get a little pu@@ pp@@ y , he comes . his only crime is he grew .
and to understand what will be the effect of the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush in the mouth , i must imagine : who ow@@ ns this mouth ?
but these things are everywhere .
and i thought , &quot; my god , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
he reach@@ es up , takes another arm@@ ful of gra@@ vel , rele@@ ases it -- ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ! -- same thing .
and when i under@@ went it and found solutions , this is the inter@@ relationship between the t@@ m@@ j and the teeth .
for example , meas@@ les was four million of the deaths back as recently as 199@@ 0 and now is under 4@@ 00,000 .
in this case , you take a move block , s@@ na@@ p it into a stack , and the stac@@ ks of blocks control the behaviors of the different charac@@ ters in your game or your story , in this case controll@@ ing the big fish .
it looks very different from what you &apos;re expe@@ cting surgery to look like .
the door sw@@ ings open , and the voice says , &quot; come in , for there is no room in this house for two i &apos;s , &quot; -- two capital i &apos;s , not these eyes -- &quot; for two e@@ gos . &quot;
but i don &apos;t think we should under@@ estimate the ex@@ tent to which massive changes in technology make possible the lin@@ king up of people across the world .
but this is what happens to most of the computers .
i lived in ireland , built the first stra@@ w-@@ b@@ ale houses in ireland , and some co@@ b buildings and all this kind of thing .
it is with this context that ushahidi came to be .
op@@ pen@@ hei@@ mer , who had built the bomb .
otherwise you &apos;d flo@@ od your entire town with war@@ m por@@ ri@@ dge .
baby . baby .
and now this is a work in progress .
as you may have noticed , our elections in canada are a complete jo@@ ke .
but appar@@ ently , no brains exist@@ ed in this place when demo@@ cr@@ ats passed and sig@@ ned this bill into law .
and it is a mar@@ vel@@ ous rain forest .
look at that f@@ on@@ t there . my wife was so pis@@ sed .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a not@@ ebook and recorded their every movement .
in fact , nature has solved it many , many times .
my story is a story of over@@ coming set@@ bac@@ ks , obstac@@ les and challenges that life thro@@ ws at you .
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to re@@ direct a lot more of our growth back into exist@@ ing communities that could use a bo@@ ost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continu@@ ing to te@@ ar down trees and to te@@ ar up the green space out at the ed@@ ges .
i have come to think it &apos;s one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sor@@ row .
they fl@@ unk out of caltech .
with all the un@@ even walls and all the cra@@ p everywhere , it actually so@@ unded pretty good .
you &apos;d think , there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of paralyzed people in the world , but the audience is too small , and the amount of research , the time it takes , the f@@ da clear@@ ances , the pay@@ back time is too long for v@@ .@@ c. to be interested .
if you &apos;d like to learn how to play the lo@@ b@@ ster , we have some here .
and these guys paint hum@@ ong@@ ous pain@@ t@@ ings , and they look really good .
this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company .
at my school -- actually i was part of co@@ -@@ fo@@ unding an organization , which is like a lea@@ der@@ ship thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
it &apos;s going to be 3@@ 6 in@@ ches in diam@@ eter .
you find yourself a mathema@@ tician ; you find yourself a physi@@ c@@ ist -- somebody who under@@ stands the dynam@@ ics of this fluid .
tw@@ b is currently in iraq training 20@@ ,000 teachers supported by us@@ aid and to them , this idea of being able to re@@ mix and custom@@ ize to the local context is extra@@ ordin@@ arily important , because just provi@@ ding free content to people has actually been li@@ ken@@ ed by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural im@@ peri@@ al@@ ism , that if you don &apos;t em@@ power people with the ability to re-@@ con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alize the material , translate it into their own language and take ow@@ ner@@ ship of it , it &apos;s not good .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
now , if you &apos;re a go@@ dd@@ ess of stars and planets wouldn &apos;t you rele@@ gate insects to somebody else ?
there &apos;s also a time to give .
and a guy named di@@ zzy g@@ ill@@ es@@ p@@ ie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here , mar@@ ty ash@@ by .
so , i would sleep in a hypo@@ x@@ ic tent every night .
we have a free system of bi@@ cycl@@ es called the city bike that you can bor@@ row if you visit the city .
but if i ask them , is the ted website going to go down ?
so if we cut open dra@@ cor@@ ex -- i cut open our dra@@ cor@@ ex -- and look , it was sp@@ ong@@ y inside , really sp@@ ong@@ y inside .
this is a figure that i love : bra@@ d@@ ley , pet@@ r@@ ie , and du@@ ma@@ is .
this is actually called a ma@@ sh@@ -@@ up , where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it .
for me , it was simply an exc@@ use to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of .
and if he did not tell them , it was of course to protect them .
and in terms of other things that i wanted to share with you , in terms of ideas , i think it &apos;s wonderful to have a situation like this , where so many people from different back@@ grounds and places can come together , exchange their ideas and form relationships of fri@@ end@@ ship with each other .
path three , you become a hero .
and so , i want to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in doing that and four lessons i &apos;ve learned in the last year .
so that &apos;s why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species .
so we have no way of v@@ ali@@ d@@ ating these particular read@@ ings , but if more and more of these read@@ ings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appe@@ ar to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; bas@@ ics ? &quot;
when i type anything , this voice will speak whatever i type .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and i just want to mention briefly in pas@@ sing -- i &apos;m past my time li@@ mit -- but i just want to briefly mention in pas@@ sing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is , at a similar meeting , back in the spring , anne wo@@ j@@ ci@@ ck@@ i heard about our story and very quickly -- in a sp@@ an of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23@@ and@@ me , and we an@@ no@@ un@@ ced an initiative in ju@@ ly to get to de@@ code the genome of anybody , a living person with a heart tissue , bone sar@@ com@@ a .
buck@@ min@@ ster ful@@ ler was the kind of green gur@@ u -- again , a word that had not been co@@ ined .
and all these devices will be port@@ als into that .
but i love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could ab@@ sor@@ b .
but more common@@ ly all around the island , they were known as the sun@@ fish .
maybe it runs in the family .
when you rel@@ ate to the world , the dynamic mani@@ fest@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ eness is , what we say , love .
you get hin@@ ts , the actual steps for that problem , if you don &apos;t know how to do it .
all we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent , sh@@ am@@ eful issue that it is .
b@@ j : and then of course , the challenge is knowing when to turn around .
in china , in russi@@ a and in lo@@ ads of other countries that are developing cy@@ ber@@ -@@ offen@@ sive cap@@ abilities , this is exactly what they are doing .
is not so much that the wing has some interesting morph@@ ology .
or how we should be@@ have about it with new technologies .
in love , we want to have , we want to know the belo@@ ved .
se@@ y@@ m@@ our is the man that introduced the use of dr@@ osop@@ hil@@ a here at caltech in the &apos; 60s as a model organis@@ m to study the connection between genes and behavior .
and , if that wasn &apos;t bad enough , of course , all of this is rapidly pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing towards the fact that many of you , in fact , about one in 10 of you at this point , will die in inten@@ sive care .
it doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way station .
the analy@@ tics are easy here .
is this a market at all , or did we just do a weird psycholog@@ ist &apos;s trick by getting mon@@ keys to do something , looking smart , but not really being smart .
it &apos;s a clinic like a health clinic at any other university , except people come to the clinic with environmental health concer@@ ns , and they walk out with prescri@@ p@@ tions for things they can do to improve environmental health , as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concer@@ ns and walking out with prescri@@ p@@ tions for phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the future .
it &apos;s hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience , it &apos;s hard to see the pattern of this .
okay . so now the titanic transition .
why ?
there &apos;s still cancer in your patient . &quot;
so most of my work , i don &apos;t use gl@@ ue .
if i look at my cycle , seven years , one year s@@ ab@@ ba@@ tical , it &apos;s 12@@ .@@ 5 percent of my time .
and , worst of all , how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically us@@ eless to me ? &quot;
what would you do if you knew that people had this mis@@ con@@ ception , right , in their heads , of elli@@ p@@ tical or@@ bits caused by our experi@@ ences as children ?
we all know who he is on television .
or take this sea cu@@ cum@@ ber .
youtube &apos;s content id system addres@@ ses all of these cases .
during this expe@@ di@@ tion i expected him to be killed ou@@ tri@@ ght , and us as well .
so , this is on the way down to the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age .
you can s@@ wal@@ low this completely integr@@ ated device .
and it &apos;s those c@@ ables in particular that i want to focus on .
that doesn &apos;t work .
i debate people who literally want to ob@@ liter@@ ate everything i believe in , in some cases , who don &apos;t want me and people like me to even exist .
the second challenge was cells .
totally different experience when i &apos;m pulling ideas .
mar@@ cus : a modern day po@@ et .
you probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years im@@ pris@@ oned for her eff@@ or@@ ts to bring about democracy .
she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little gol@@ den apple .
now , why am i telling you this story at this meeting ?
there &apos;s even a software called cad@@ nan@@ o that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes like nan@@ o robots or drug deli@@ very systems and use dna to self-@@ assem@@ ble those func@@ tional structures .
but we have this jar@@ g@@ on term of neutr@@ ality , which has its own long history within the community , which basically says , any time there &apos;s a contro@@ versi@@ al issue , wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue .
and our minds immediately turned to cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer in women , which is spread by a virus , and to the aids epidemic , which is associated with a number of different types of cancer .
what she found was many of these stories tend to bl@@ ame victi@@ ms and de@@ value their lives .
we &apos;ve got a choice before us .
57@@ ,@@ 6@@ 8@@ 3 squ@@ ared . y@@ u@@ ck .
and par@@ tly this is already happening .
in a pri@@ mi@@ tive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
but i felt it was too much to ask to have to ad@@ just each individual arm@@ rest in order to get it where you wanted .
what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution , the most important means , the most important components of the core economic activi@@ ties -- remember , we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced econom@@ ies , and there more than anywhere else , are in the hands of the population at large . this is completely different than what we &apos;ve seen since the industrial revolution . so we &apos;ve got communications and compu@@ tation capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we &apos;ve got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major in@@ put -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this le@@ ver all day long -- is not something that &apos;s the same or fun@@ gi@@ ble among people .
you got@@ ta push through sh@@ y@@ ness and self-@@ dou@@ bt .
but the important idea is that everything &apos;s at hand , everything &apos;s around .
you see the structure as , in the sequence of structures on the mall , very transparent and invi@@ ting and looking in .
paralyzed by a stro@@ ke , henry ev@@ ans uses a tel@@ ep@@ res@@ ence robot to take the stage -- and show how new robo@@ tics , t@@ weak@@ ed and person@@ alized by a group called robots for humanity , help him live his life . he shows off a ni@@ mble little quad@@ ro@@ tor dr@@ one , created by a team led by ch@@ ad jen@@ kins , that gives him the ability to navi@@ gate space -- to once again look around a garden , stro@@ ll a cam@@ pus … &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
so they are able to do it in that sense .
i get stuck in traffic -- evil , evil traffic .
and so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?
there is .
steven john@@ son : how the &quot; gh@@ ost map &quot; helped end a killer disease
why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some an@@ om@@ al@@ y of this ridiculous , glo@@ w-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark bac@@ teri@@ um that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this .
now to conclu@@ de , how does that happen ?
the war in viet@@ na@@ m was ra@@ ging , the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me .
j@@ f : over on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you will notice fuel consumption de@@ cre@@ asing as the rocket takes off .
it can pro@@ mp@@ t action .
whereas if the present self sa@@ ves a lot , the future self is de@@ ligh@@ ted , where the income is close up near 100 percent .
how many of you think that &apos;s ki@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s bu@@ ba ? raise your hands .
you have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen .
but while there might be some shor@@ t-@@ term individual winn@@ ers , our collective los@@ ses will far out@@ wei@@ gh them .
because what &apos;s happening ? back to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the gol@@ d@@ man sa@@ chs ch@@ art .
it is a bit of ja@@ g@@ gery , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things i don &apos;t know .
now god , an@@ ger@@ ed at this attempt to us@@ ur@@ p his power , destro@@ yed the tower , and then to en@@ sure that it would never be re@@ built , he sc@@ at@@ tered the people by giving them different languages -- con@@ f@@ used them by giving them different languages .
well now there are potenti@@ als of this building to allow the arti@@ stic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
for you , and you heard already , being so close to this gun may make you feel un@@ easy .
that &apos;s an experience that not every other musli@@ m nation in the middle east had until very recently .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-@@ human currency .
well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world , then it &apos;s absolutely central to society .
and you can &apos;t tell .
these people like better the one they own , but they don &apos;t know they own it .
the me@@ mes are all trying to get cop@@ i@@ ed -- trying , in in@@ ver@@ ted comm@@ as -- i.@@ e. , that &apos;s the shor@@ th@@ and for , if they can get cop@@ i@@ ed , they will .
this is the future that a@@ wa@@ its us .
and therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mi@@ ce , into men , are not yi@@ el@@ ding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
i &apos;d like to tell you about a magi@@ cal place called dar@@ pa where scientists and engineers de@@ fy the impossible and ref@@ use to fear fail@@ ure .
we would expect there to be no difference , because ne@@ anderth@@ als were never in africa .
am@@ ory lov@@ ins : a 4@@ 0-@@ year plan for energy
tele@@ phone ? no .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may con@@ tradi@@ ct the p@@ lot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot;
i had to pull one , leave it , and go back and get the other one .
and i don &apos;t think sun@@ day foot@@ ball@@ -@@ watching and general la@@ z@@ iness is the cause .
this is a pretty interesting trend , because we used to live in a world where everyone &apos;s said gli@@ bly , &quot; form follo@@ ws function , &quot; but i think i &apos;ve sort of grown up in a world -- you listen@@ ed to nei@@ l ger@@ sh@@ en@@ feld yesterday ; i was in a lab associated with his -- where it &apos;s really a world where information defin@@ es form and function .
there was a little local diffic@@ ul@@ ty in some of our min@@ or colon@@ ies , but ...
back then you couldn &apos;t even look at the ear@@ dr@@ um .
this is not your normal gar@@ den-@@ variety flu .
but in contr@@ ast to my evil t@@ win who lu@@ sts after world dom@@ ination , my mo@@ tives are not sin@@ ist@@ er .
and they do this wr@@ apping .
a complicated question .
but in st. john &apos;s , i was in the lower quar@@ ter .
then , one night , the scene changes .
and whatever else is needed , i will provide it and pay for it when i return . &quot;
and yet , a few years earlier , death never cros@@ sed their mind .
so as you walk around a church , or a mos@@ que or a ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l , what you &apos;re trying to im@@ bi@@ be , what you &apos;re im@@ bi@@ bing is , through your eyes , through your sen@@ ses , tru@@ ths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
those fossil fu@@ els have built our civilization .
we swi@@ tched bus@@ es at the big pon@@ d . we then got on two more bus@@ es and we dro@@ ve through tur@@ key and iran , afghanistan , over the k@@ hy@@ ber pass , into pakistan , like every other young doctor .
so after the interaction , we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology , with a remote collabor@@ ator through this technology , in a number of different ways .
and no tri@@ cky sh@@ it behind the thing . i mean , it &apos;s all -- you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
so in 19@@ 70 , if you wanted to communicate from oxford to jo@@ han@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g to new delhi to br@@ as@@ ili@@ a and anywhere simul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , you could do it .
and some things look very familiar today .
so i think the way forward for the world -- one that will bring the path of ou@@ ter development in har@@ mon@@ y with the real root of happiness -- is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart .
i &apos;m asking you to help them , ac@@ cept as human beings -- not as philanthrop@@ y , not as char@@ ity , but as human beings who deserve all our support .
they had a 12@@ -@@ page supp@@ lement in the wall street journal the day it launched .
for example , i know some teachers aren &apos;t immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom .
it &apos;s in the mi@@ d-@@ pac@@ i@@ fic . it &apos;s about five days from anywhere .
steven pin@@ ker : human nature and the b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late
the ba@@ thro@@ oms and kit@@ ch@@ ens will , of course , have no windows .
for some reason i keep remember@@ ing that lady j@@ ane gre@@ y was que@@ en of england when she was only 15 .
and the food ban@@ ks are growing .
cop@@ enha@@ gen , shanghai , modern , european .
if you can find a way to take the tri@@ bes that you &apos;re in and nu@@ dge them forward , along these trib@@ al sta@@ ges to what we call stage five , which is the top of the mountain .
the hig@@ hl@@ ine is an old , el@@ ev@@ ated ra@@ il line that runs for a mile and a half right through manhattan .
a great success .
and it &apos;s the idea that we don &apos;t have dis@@ pos@@ able anything .
where are the rest of the swa@@ hil@@ i speak@@ ers ?
all right , now what we &apos;re just feeling there is pl@@ us-@@ one emo@@ tional resili@@ ence , which means you have the ability to pro@@ vo@@ ke powerful , positive emotions like curi@@ osity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most .
well many scientists who study religion take this view .
now , let &apos;s take a normal example .
so many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some jum@@ pe@@ d-@@ up engineer has come along with the answer .
exploring the fe@@ min@@ ine , nur@@ turing side of di@@ vin@@ ity .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
everybody should have one , ok ?
and the exciting thing is that we do have suff@@ i@@ cient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots , hot@@ spots .
i invented lif@@ es@@ a@@ ver bottle because i got an@@ gry .
it &apos;s a micro@@ -@@ controller .
this is a kind of agen@@ da , which actually politicians themselves are kind of cau@@ ght in that dilemma , because they &apos;re ho@@ o@@ ked on the growth model themselves .
what &apos;s un@@ usual about that ?
&quot; why should the lam@@ p or the house be an art object , but not our life ? &quot;
as they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was b@@ ent over and mo@@ an@@ ing , clearly in need . the question is : did they stop to help ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes .
it &apos;s common . it &apos;s fres@@ h .
as a person who bu@@ ys the products .
so over the last several years , kids around the world ages 8 and up , have shared their projects , and i thought , i wonder if , of those three million projects , whether anyone else has thought to put up mother &apos;s day car@@ ds .
getting the creative ju@@ ices flo@@ wing on this continent , much of what you have seen here .
a lot more to be said about that .
this is happening , however , against the background of the rise of web log@@ ging .
per@@ spec@@ tives can be alter@@ ed .
the ab@@ c network , aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately known in the trade as the t &amp; amp ; a network , right -- that &apos;s not too much jar@@ g@@ on , is it ?
so a german magazine compared german wikipedia , which is really much , much smaller than english , to microsoft en@@ car@@ ta and to bro@@ ck@@ haus multi@@ media , and we won across the board .
young and old , dan@@ cing in the streets .
let me be clear .
it &apos;s above and behind your right e@@ ar .
the final thing is , again just to rei@@ ter@@ ate that there &apos;s this practical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti@@ -@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing mole@@ cul@@ es that are being developed as new kinds of therap@@ eu@@ tics .
that &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
i &apos;m really , really excited . this is not going to take 50 years at all .
ap@@ oll@@ on@@ ian min@@ d@@ set creates mountains of waste .
it &apos;s kind of like archite@@ cts who show people in their houses , as opposed to them being emp@@ ty .
and in the discus@@ sion i atten@@ ded with global leaders , you know , many say now the problem is that the emerging econom@@ ies , they are getting out too much carbon di@@ oxide .
this girl right here knows exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
everybody i talk to says it &apos;s rub@@ bis@@ h .
so it was true .
infrastructure everywhere .
s@@ van@@ te found that the fox@@ p@@ 2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in ne@@ anderth@@ als as us .
and of course hab@@ its are en@@ forced by architecture .
and now he &apos;s gone , and so am i@@ . thank you very much .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by im@@ ing from their office to their friends , by tex@@ ting under the des@@ k .
all@@ an j@@ ones : a map of the brain
you see the whole big picture ?
most important , we all really need to listen to each other , including to the bor@@ ing bits .
it is ter@@ restri@@ al s@@ kin@@ ning .
and the third user group , in thailand , is think eleph@@ ants . go ahead , jos@@ h .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan .
and how do you bring those two things together ?
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recogni@@ tion software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
so , everybody can r@@ ank these mon@@ et prin@@ ts from the one they like the most , to the one they like the least .
i think you &apos;d have to conclu@@ de -- if you look at the out@@ put , who really succe@@ e@@ ds by this , who does everything that they should , who gets all the bro@@ w@@ nie points , who are the winn@@ ers -- i think you &apos;d have to conclu@@ de the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university profess@@ ors . isn &apos;t it ?
you could tell it wasn &apos;t a real ja@@ il .
and so , people -- this is a study that i did now .
for too long , we have pe@@ dd@@ led a ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ ish vision of what &apos;s going to happen .
well , once you &apos;ve had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don &apos;t read your me@@ m@@ o -- actually he did , it was found after he died , his copy .
30 or so scientists around the world gather@@ ed and asked a question for the first time , &quot; do we have to put the planet into the the pot ? &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of cri@@ tics and re@@ form@@ ers had come to see philanthrop@@ y just this way .
the auto@@ -@@ gy@@ r@@ o couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the heli@@ cop@@ ter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
my dad ow@@ ned an automo@@ tive and industrial repair shop .
so , these are three-@@ po@@ und char@@ ges of c@@ 4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
and actually , we see glam@@ ori@@ zed photos of stars all the time -- they call them fal@@ se color .
when i think about the world i would like to leave to my daughter and the grand@@ children i hope to have , it is a world that moves away from un@@ equal , un@@ stable , un@@ sustainable inter@@ dependence to integr@@ ated communities -- lo@@ cally , nation@@ ally and globally -- that share the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of all successful communities : a broad@@ ly shared , acc@@ essi@@ ble set of opportunities , a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enter@@ prise and a genu@@ ine sense of bel@@ on@@ ging .
related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the colle@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess , colle@@ ctivity is the idea of exist@@ ence maximum .
we &apos;ve been approach@@ ed by several simulation companies , but one project we &apos;re particularly excited about , which we &apos;re starting next month , is to use our technology -- and in particular , the walking technology -- to help aid surge@@ ons who work on children with cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l pal@@ sy , to predict the out@@ come of oper@@ ations on these children .
we give them some insight into what choices they can make , what actions they can take .
they &apos;re both s@@ hr@@ in@@ king and re@@ tre@@ ating -- and some of them have disappeared al@@ together .
and this program takes a shape , sp@@ its out 250 dna sequences .
i &apos;ve got a great idea that &apos;s going to change the world .
and the same di@@ vin@@ ation system is found all over africa .
let us support these people .
i feel that there are some things that are getting in the way .
so my wife sm@@ ells ni@@ cer than i do , or i just stin@@ k more than she does .
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
and that &apos;s a lot of load .
what if it all started here at ted ?
they are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
let me give you an example . when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy , one of the people who wrote in , not entirely in agre@@ ement , was tom frie@@ d@@ man . and since my article was ti@@ tled &quot; why the world isn &apos;t flat , &quot; that wasn &apos;t too surprising .
don &apos;t m@@ our@@ n . organize .
and then we give him a reason for sitting .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
so it &apos;s this here , this little ga@@ p that you have to close , as je@@ ff@@ re@@ y mo@@ ore call@@ s it , &quot; crossing the ch@@ as@@ m &quot; -- because , you see , the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first .
and i think you will see why the two greatest passi@@ ons in my life today are children and education .
and when you buy medicine , you won &apos;t be buying a drug that &apos;s used for everybody .
and we were particularly touched by the flo@@ wers and we were curious as to how the flo@@ wers got there . &quot;
so we &apos;ve got tri@@ ple the space , but we &apos;ve become such good sh@@ op@@ pers that we need even more space .
tor@@ sten rei@@ l : that &apos;s it , yes .
and yet , nobody listen@@ ed to them .
they are some of our fin@@ est instru@@ ments , our new technology in the ocean today .
the norden bom@@ b@@ sight is the hol@@ y gra@@ il .
understand that you are part of this enormous cha@@ in of events .
and this se@@ at@@ b@@ elt would have passed with flying colors into being appro@@ ved as a car seat .
if she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got married , the mother is bl@@ amed for that , and she &apos;s pun@@ ished .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to re@@ build these boun@@ dar@@ ies .
in addi@@ tion to higher res@@ ol@@ ution versi@@ ons of this dis@@ play , my father and i are working on a new pat@@ ent@@ -@@ pen@@ ding design for a fully volu@@ me@@ tri@@ c dis@@ play using the same phenomenon .
but having commit@@ ted to the process , i continued on , and something really surprising came out of this .
there &apos;s a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there .
so i met this character , steven .
because there were images in it he said were lic@@ enti@@ ous .
but they don &apos;t want to be journalists . the journalists think that the blog@@ gers want to be journalists ; they don &apos;t want to be journalists ; they just want to have a voice .
david atten@@ bor@@ ough : throughout al@@ as@@ ka and british colum@@ bia , thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep .
our voices matter and our actions matter even more .
are we fo@@ oli@@ sh to be optimi@@ stic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great r@@ all@@ ying cr@@ y of divi@@ de and war , that there could be brid@@ ging ?
no cro@@ ws are brought up .
top climate scientist james hansen tells the story of his invol@@ v@@ ement in the science of and debate over global climate change . in doing so he out@@ lines the over@@ whel@@ ming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future .
it will make a difference if you were to dis@@ cover that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed version of your son or daughter , your mother or father .
so ja@@ un@@ di@@ ce affects two-@@ thir@@ ds of new@@ bor@@ ns around the world .
they get scared to walk around . they get scared to move .
now even though we &apos;re combin@@ ing the trans@@ la@@ tions , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
and i took these two men and did what i call an indi@@ re@@ ct negoti@@ ation .
that is another story .
and so this was a three-@@ month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly un@@ stable element .
so one needs to be care@@ ful with discipl@@ in@@ ary conven@@ tions .
in that year , there were 34 countries affected with small@@ po@@ x .
thank you very much .
we studied what others had done , what we could copy and what we could change .
po@@ op can co@@ ok your dinner .
and we save some of those for the next generation .
i said , &quot; any chance you know will@@ ie brown ? &quot;
and it &apos;s time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we &apos;re thinking about it is to constru@@ ct argu@@ ments for why we shouldn &apos;t do it .
so thank you very much .
actually , he was medi@@ tating on compassion .
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them , which is really not much , because camp three is a little not@@ ch cut in the ice in the middle of a 4@@ 5@@ -@@ degree ang@@ le .
now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called levi@@ tation is actually lo@@ cking , yeah , we understand that .
this is a kind of a blo@@ wing stra@@ w .
and i looked at it and i said , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t see anything . &quot;
then , about the initiative that chris mentioned , that we decided to la@@ unch at am@@ d that we call 50@@ x@@ 15 .
&quot; and it has hol@@ es in its fri@@ ll . &quot;
now , getting there is not easy .
in our imagination , it has to be light .
which is the truth . it &apos;s their oil .
audience : yes .
and the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field .
what else is in this picture ?
you may be wondering , &quot; how do you make arti@@ ficial se@@ men ? &quot;
and for the veter@@ ans in particular , the v@@ .a. said there &apos;s a si@@ x-@@ fold increase in mental health phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als by v@@ ets since 2003 .
but as the decades passed , these festi@@ v@@ als , they really became the establi@@ sh@@ ment , and as the culture and capital acceler@@ ated , the internet brought us all together , high and low kind of disappeared , a new kind of festi@@ val emer@@ ged .
ra@@ m : i &apos;ll tell you a story that dro@@ ve me , that transformed my life .
d@@ r : we &apos;re looking from ful@@ ton street , west .
can you just raise the hand ?
so , as the cli@@ mbers came by me , i sort of ass@@ ess@@ ed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .
there &apos;s a collection of 10 countries , some call them the li@@ ons , who in the last decade have had a combination of 100 percent de@@ bt can@@ c@@ ell@@ ation , a tri@@ pl@@ ing of aid , a ten@@ fold increase in f@@ di -- that &apos;s foreign direct investment -- which has un@@ locked a quad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ing of dom@@ esti@@ c resources -- that &apos;s local money -- which , when spent wi@@ sely -- that &apos;s good govern@@ ance -- cut childhood mortality by a third , dou@@ bled education comple@@ tion rates , and they , too , hal@@ ved extreme poverty , and at this rate , these 10 get to zero too .
and on day six , they basically thre@@ w in the to@@ we@@ l .
so even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
and in parallel at that time , there was a very kind of ex@@ clu@@ sive design club .
no one &apos;s listening . no one &apos;s tru@@ sting .
and they were ti@@ red of all the in@@ conven@@ i@@ ences of the si@@ ou@@ x .
i remember my grand@@ father re@@ vising the cap@@ itals of the world with me .
in the american mi@@ d@@ west , farmers used to load gra@@ in onto bar@@ ges and send it u@@ pri@@ ver to the chicago market .
it is so big , they have tax@@ is in the mall .
they dele@@ gate education about inf@@ ant fe@@ eding , family plan@@ ning , sa@@ fer sex , actions that nur@@ ses simple just don &apos;t have time for .
so a little over a decade ago , two groups of physici@@ sts and astronom@@ ers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was s@@ lo@@ wing down , ok .
but it &apos;s also about producing a language to describe this .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
&quot; can i just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
so they have ad@@ ju@@ sted the 2012 olymp@@ ic budget for the optimism bi@@ as .
one is to continue to see a poor , ill , cr@@ ying africa , car@@ rying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to pro@@ mote an africa which is con@@ fi@@ dent , pe@@ ac@@ eful , independent , but cogni@@ z@@ ant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .
without it , a script is just words .
every species does it .
it &apos;s actually quite li@@ fel@@ ess . once it forms , it doesn &apos;t really do anything .
you don &apos;t have that kind of fine control with conventional lea@@ ther .
there are still many questions to be answer@@ ed and asked about roman@@ tic love .
that &apos;s a fan@@ cy way of saying it &apos;s got shops , bars , bi@@ stro@@ s , dest@@ in@@ ations -- things go in and out of it . it &apos;s per@@ me@@ able .
and they ask a series of really interesting questions .
inst@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the links .
stop giving them li@@ sts of questions every single one of which has an answer .
our social lives in the future depend on that .
we &apos;ll have comple@@ ted the re@@ ver@@ se@@ -@@ engineering of the human brain , 1@@ ,000 dollars of compu@@ ting will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic ra@@ w capacity .
can you take this bi@@ osph@@ ere , that has evolved on a planet@@ ary scale , and ja@@ m it into a little bottle , and will it survive ?
he &apos;s absolutely right .
now , i could make a game called pie@@ cra@@ ft , where all you had to do was get a million p@@ ies or a thousand p@@ ies .
and this is called notes , and this is coming -- basically sc@@ ar@@ less surgery , as medi@@ ated by robo@@ tic surgery .
and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company , ge@@ ely , they acqui@@ red the vol@@ v@@ o company , and then finally the swe@@ des understood that something big had happened in the world .
i don &apos;t know why . but i thought , you know , sometimes it &apos;s just not the right time for an invention ; maybe it &apos;s time to give this one another shot .
or my favorite , &quot; li@@ ab@@ han ch@@ or gr@@ eine , &quot; the great fish of the sun .
at the beginning it &apos;s very uni@@ form .
there are only 16 different pieces of wood , only 16 different assem@@ bly parts here .
they don &apos;t have to be in the office at a certain time , or any time .
this is an ic@@ on of our robot , j@@ as@@ on , it &apos;s called .
nature provi@@ des a first dra@@ ft , which experience then re@@ vis@@ es .
now , the monit@@ or is just as limited as the page , techni@@ cally , right ?
so basically , if you wanted to gener@@ alize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consu@@ med redu@@ ces dra@@ matically .
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
and they &apos;ve become elegant and s@@ len@@ der -- they don &apos;t really have th@@ ig@@ h@@ s ; they just have one elegant cal@@ ve on top of another .
gene and ga@@ il know everyone in atlan@@ ta -- they &apos;re the most social couple imag@@ in@@ able .
and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
at that point , we &apos;ll start roman@@ tici@@ zing the future again , instead of the na@@ sty , bru@@ tish past .
so we &apos;re going to check that out by having the chim@@ ps actually play a game by tou@@ ching two touch scre@@ ens .
in a zi@@ pp@@ y dem@@ o at u , an@@ n@@ mar@@ ie thomas shows how two different kinds of hom@@ e@@ made play d@@ ough can be used to demonstrate electri@@ cal properties -- by ligh@@ ting up le@@ ds , spinn@@ ing motors , and turning little kids into circu@@ it designers .
and then i met yo@@ yo , who is the native rap@@ a nu@@ i@@ -@@ an guide , and if you look at yo@@ yo &apos;s face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
that was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country .
and i am illu@@ str@@ ating still .
in the same way , our lives are domin@@ ated by gravi@@ ty but are almost ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to the force of surface ten@@ sion .
that &apos;s me sho@@ ot@@ ing , and i &apos;m a fair@@ ly medi@@ oc@@ re oper@@ ator , so i got that nice sense of ver@@ is@@ im@@ ili@@ tude , of a kind of , you know , following the rocket all the way down , and giving that little sort of edge , i was des@@ perat@@ ely trying to keep it in frame . so then i come up to the next thing .
and i think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the va@@ st@@ ness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
but there is an under@@ bel@@ ly .
i want to address the issue of sa@@ v@@ ings .
i love some of these , physical exercise , pra@@ yer .
it &apos;s actually this little piece up here on the top .
what we &apos;re trying to do is build a virtual world .
they &apos;ve invented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better .
they &apos;re basically vi@@ able cells , so someone like bo@@ b lan@@ za at advanced cell technology took some of that tissue from an en@@ danger@@ ed animal called the ja@@ van ban@@ ten@@ g , put it in a cow , the cow went to term , and what was born was a live , healthy baby ja@@ van ban@@ ten@@ g , who thri@@ ved and is still alive .
this is one of the most rob@@ ust fin@@ dings in social science , and also one of the most ignor@@ ed .
so we got to work .
i &apos;m very fortun@@ ate to be here .
there are natural biological materials .
in this case , the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um makes a very b@@ old predi@@ ction , which is everyone wants to be below everyone else , therefore they &apos;ll play zero .
but the way that our institutions are designed , in our rather 18@@ th@@ -@@ century , cent@@ r@@ alized model , is to chan@@ nel the flow of values through vot@@ ing , once every four years , once every two years , at best , once a year . this is a rather an@@ e@@ mic and thin way , in this era of social media , for us to actually express our values .
and some are quite struc@@ tural , like social impact bon@@ ds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting te@@ en@@ a@@ gers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
it has this bi@@ zar@@ re , on@@ going philosop@@ hi@@ cal project of divi@@ ding all the in@@ anima@@ te objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer .
so it &apos;s kind of like you having a job in chicago , and then you get trans@@ fer@@ red to st. louis , and your mate is not happy about this because you &apos;ve got to pay air@@ f@@ are , because you &apos;re gone longer .
i had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging sur@@ ger@@ ies .
and my favorite feature , which is a flo@@ wer in a v@@ ase that wil@@ ts when you leave in dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ tment , and then when you come back , it comes up to gre@@ et you , happy to see you .
and they will have the pleasure , many of them , of seeing those fro@@ gs that they &apos;ve raised from eggs and helped develop , helped nur@@ ture , move out into protected wild@@ lands to au@@ gment the number of en@@ danger@@ ed species out there in the wild .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red ti@@ des , for example , which are blo@@ oms of toxic al@@ ga@@ e floating through the oceans caus@@ ing neuro@@ logi@@ cal damage .
but , in a way , i &apos;ve got used to the sen@@ sation of it .
the second wish is , at the present time , the clinical trials of tran@@ sc@@ ran@@ ial magnetic stimul@@ ators -- that &apos;s what t@@ ms means , device to treat mi@@ gra@@ ine hea@@ da@@ ches -- appe@@ ars to be quite successful .
mis@@ direction .
and to a fish ner@@ d , this is some pretty exciting stuff .
i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u.@@ n. system .
let &apos;s figure out how long it takes a ra@@ c@@ ec@@ ar to go a certain distance .
numbers are the musical notes with which the symph@@ ony of the universe is written .
our man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt was then accep@@ ted and will be published later this month in the journal radi@@ ology .
today the average dri@@ ver in beijing has a five-@@ hour com@@ mu@@ te .
he said , &quot; i remember the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ines going around the hu@@ t wondering what was inside , &quot; and he said they made sounds like &quot; yi@@ p ! yi@@ p ! yi@@ p ! &quot;
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
and all these photographs that i &apos;m showing , they were sent in by members .
they &apos;re dynamic .
we have fa@@ ding memor@@ ies of that pro@@ visi@@ onal temp@@ le , er@@ e@@ cted each time an adult sat down .
that struck a ch@@ ord , and i said , &quot; that &apos;s true . &quot;
i took the idea of the wri@@ st@@ watch , and i turned it into a musical sc@@ ore .
so it &apos;s not all bad .
so we did another interview survey , tried to figure out why people changed their mind , and what type of group changed their minds ?
and this is actually a very brief clip -- only about 30 seconds -- of a patient who actually recei@@ ved an organ .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you di@@ late the cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ teri@@ es also , to let the blood be supp@@ lied with the heart .
how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain un@@ fil@@ med until now ?
it &apos;s in@@ san@@ e . and they have these systems where you can le@@ vel@@ -@@ up .
you die also because oxygen to@@ xic@@ ity can cause a sei@@ z@@ ure -- makes you con@@ vul@@ se underwater , not a good thing to happen underwater .
there was some bomb shel@@ ter built , appar@@ ently in the &apos; 60s cu@@ ban mis@@ si@@ le crisis .
su@@ mm@@ er@@ time and the living is easy fish are j@@ ump@@ ing and the cotton is high oh , your da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s rich and your ma is goo@@ d-@@ looking so hus@@ h little baby don &apos;t you cr@@ y and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
another section of the family pres@@ ented their clo@@ thing , as opposed to their physical presence , because they didn &apos;t want to be identi@@ fied with the past that i was high@@ ligh@@ ting .
how do we explore intelligence in this animal that &apos;s so different from us ?
because nobody &apos;s going to help you and support you if you &apos;re not mana@@ ging your own finan@@ ces well .
this destruction idea turned into a ye@@ ar@@ long project that i called good@@ b@@ ye art , where each and every piece of art had to be destro@@ yed after its creation .
they are a graphi@@ cal visu@@ alization of a character .
life is too complex for a software program .
thank you .
trilli@@ ons of dollars a year are being brought into the region , so much of it being invest@@ ed into china .
cars are all wrong .
and the middle size one is really sp@@ ong@@ y .
and they &apos;re all pra@@ ying to the mountain go@@ ds as they go into tr@@ ance .
this is going to change science , i believe , and it will change religion .
and she said , &quot; well , i saw you speak , and i &apos;m going to call you a resear@@ cher , i think , but i &apos;m afraid if i call you a resear@@ cher , no one will come , because they &apos;ll think you &apos;re bor@@ ing and ir@@ relevant . &quot;
they don &apos;t even attempt to cor@@ ral the oil where it is most concent@@ rated .
the reason the squid is willing to put up with these sh@@ en@@ ani@@ gan@@ s is because it wants that light .
it can reach into m@@ ill@@ en@@ nia that have been buried , and return them in a just and unexpected equ@@ ity .
my working definition of technology is &quot; anything useful that a human mind makes . &quot;
when al gore won his well-@@ deser@@ ved os@@ car for the &quot; in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth &quot; movie , i was thri@@ ll@@ ed , but i had ur@@ ged him to make a second movie quickly .
and colle@@ c@@ tively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
so i &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
and they can actually often be smarter than even the smar@@ test person within them .
he did do it . the ten@@ der had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ read@@ able , mes@@ h@@ -@@ network , low-@@ power , but just a van@@ illa laptop pro@@ pos@@ al .
look at tiv@@ o .
the instru@@ ments are loud enough that they can be heard without amp@@ li@@ fication , etc . , etc .
and this is really bad news because plastic is not an in@@ ert sub@@ stance .
stories cannot demo@@ li@@ sh fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can pun@@ ch hol@@ es in our mental walls .
and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best art@@ work for &quot; in my world . &quot; and what would happen -- it &apos;s a sc@@ al@@ able thing . and if we can get people to put in things -- whether it &apos;s equipment , like a media lab , or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools , or schools that are with kids that age , and make it a wi@@ de@@ -@@ open competition for them to go after those pri@@ zes and to sub@@ mit them .
or perhaps , spider man will one day be ge@@ ck@@ o man .
and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because i do know something about that -- he wasn &apos;t as em@@ powered , i think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history .
t@@ j : it has to be companies . it has to be civil society .
even today , we know that there are words we cannot use , phr@@ ases we cannot say , because if we do so , we might be ac@@ co@@ sted , ja@@ iled , or even killed .
david lang : my underwater robot
take a look at these guys , they &apos;re growing in power , and by the way , this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis , and that &apos;s probably going to get ste@@ ep@@ er .
huge potential sour@@ ces of scientific information yet to be gather@@ ed , much of our environmental st@@ ability and new kinds of phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als and new products of uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able streng@@ th and value -- all thro@@ wn away .
and i went on vac@@ ation with my parents to the j@@ er@@ se@@ y sh@@ ore .
and in this way , complexity buil@@ ds stage by stage .
micro@@ flu@@ i@@ di@@ cs can re@@ place an entire lab of techni@@ cians .
so i ran a little scan .
and suddenly mo@@ wing the la@@ wn that day was a completely different experience .
they learn much faster .
children with c@@ left pal@@ ates will get it , and they docum@@ ent their story . this is wonderful .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being fil@@ med .
and even now , as you memor@@ ize the order of the planets , something else is sli@@ pping away , a state flo@@ wer perhaps , the address of an uncle , the capital of para@@ gu@@ ay .
i &apos;ve been told by the revolution of military aff@@ air@@ s crow@@ d for years , we can do it faster , che@@ aper , smaller , just as le@@ th@@ al .
&quot; i have now du@@ pli@@ cated both results .
tony rob@@ bins : why we do what we do
you would tell everyone below you what to do .
an@@ gry , fru@@ str@@ ated , really up@@ set about the state of her society and the state of her children , this young girl started a movement , a movement of ordinary women band@@ ing together to build peace .
and it was sug@@ gest@@ ed to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there qui@@ et@@ ly .
now , i think that this is a great metaph@@ or for the state of architecture and archite@@ cts today .
most of the things mentioned in our 198@@ 1 paper were facts .
and i loved that thought , of being able to share my ideas through the prin@@ ted page .
each f@@ lash on this visu@@ alization -- put together by i@@ to world -- shows an ed@@ it in 200@@ 9 made to the open street map .
so , happy continued success .
there would be a global re@@ cession and depression as our ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time inv@@ ent@@ ory system and the ti@@ ght rub@@ ber band of glob@@ alization broke , and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than mer@@ ely 100 million people dying because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the con@@ sequences are almost un@@ thin@@ k@@ able .
now why would this kind of fet@@ al learning be useful ?
because it &apos;s like as bill clinton was saying about rwand@@ an health clin@@ ics .
promised virtu@@ es fall pre@@ y to the passi@@ ons of the moment .
this is actually a simple solid organ like the e@@ ar .
what would our un@@ born children say to us when they have an ex@@ pos@@ ure today , i had some o@@ ct@@ y@@ phen@@ ols , some arti@@ ficial mus@@ ks and some bis@@ phen@@ ol a .
you can see that for the pre@@ val@@ ence to be as high as un@@ aids says , we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group .
i went to his home town .
they give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ wers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , power or not .
i thought i would spend 20 bucks .
i made -- i took my old ma@@ cin@@ tos@@ h@@ es and made different objects out of them from to@@ k@@ yo .
and so , for tas@@ ks like this , a nar@@ row focus , where you just see the goal right there , zo@@ om straight ahead to it , they work really well .
cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l f@@ loo@@ ds the brain ; it destro@@ ys hip@@ po@@ camp@@ al cells and memory , and can lead to all kinds of health problems .
especially if you &apos;re me , &apos; cause alzheimer &apos;s tends to run in families .
well , what about other great leaders ? what about gandhi ?
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does inter@@ nation@@ ally , but it &apos;s incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .
it was a huge amount of pictures .
and i had in@@ cess@@ ant fun making fun of him in the training room because he &apos;d come in with foot in@@ ju@@ ries .
and we see truly in some musli@@ m communities that tradition .
the lar@@ va@@ e have to develop very quickly .
thank you .
yes , it &apos;s the first sentence of fran@@ z k@@ af@@ ka &apos;s &quot; the met@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ osis . &quot;
that &apos;s what i want to talk about .
they get dro@@ w@@ ned out by the bub@@ ble .
this is popular work@@ ben@@ ch . popular science maga@@ zin@@ es in those days -- i had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 3@@ 0s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sun@@ glas@@ ses out of wire co@@ at han@@ gers and everything impro@@ vis@@ ed and dre@@ am@@ ing about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice ho@@ ck@@ ey at 300 miles an hour -- it &apos;s all going to happen , it &apos;s all going to be wonderful .
because i want to simpli@@ fy them for you .
we find that students get very excited when they can use this .
and it &apos;s not any single system that makes the work .
now along the way , george points out that his technology , the technology of synthetic biology , is currently acceler@@ ating at four times the rate of mo@@ ore &apos;s law .
and then , because i &apos;m looking for the up@@ side here , i &apos;ve got to have belie@@ vable up@@ side .
now our responsibility is to push that edge .
many other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or worse .
he was clearly under as@@ sau@@ lt all the time .
i was thri@@ ll@@ ed to get it . i was thri@@ ll@@ ed to be the only person standing on the stage with a sh@@ iny sil@@ ver hel@@ met .
it &apos;s not even clear that our very close genetic rela@@ tives , the ne@@ anderth@@ als , had social learning .
the key to our dom@@ ination of the planet is culture , and the key to culture is religion .
but you can &apos;t tell me , no , i can &apos;t be mo@@ w@@ gl@@ i , because guess what ?
and he would say , well that &apos;s not in the kor@@ an .
and as you all know , anybody with cancer has to get follo@@ w-@@ up sc@@ ans .
basically , these people commit@@ ted ec@@ ological su@@ i@@ cide in order to make more of these .
money is useful for buying food , su@@ sten@@ ance , among all its other uses .
so we were looking for a much more obje@@ ctive way to ass@@ ess this phenomena .
and this is why our species has pros@@ per@@ ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zo@@ os , langu@@ ishing .
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms .
there is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen -- that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
i have had my father in my life always .
so we made that focus diagra@@ m .
well , they came up with three very general cri@@ teria . first is -- and they &apos;re li@@ sted here .
the first long-@@ distance line from bo@@ ston to new york was used in 18@@ 85 on the phone .
i get to write , sometimes for s@@ olo@@ ists and i get to work with one person , sometimes full orchestr@@ as , and i work with a lot of people , and this is probably the capacity , the role crea@@ tively for which i &apos;m probably best known professi@@ on@@ ally .
and that is that we live in a comp@@ et@@ ent universe , that we are part of a brilliant planet , and that we are surrounded by genius .
and she said , &quot; oh no , i &apos;m not married . &quot;
we were really ma@@ d at my mom . we looked out the window .
so let &apos;s switch ge@@ ars and look at a really complex problem cour@@ tes@@ y of the u.s. government .
you get people out of poverty .
therefore , he was not following everybody &apos;s lead , and therefore , he was a ma@@ ver@@ ick .
it &apos;s a kind of mechan@@ istic world that we &apos;d all love to live in where , effec@@ tively , it si@@ ts very ni@@ c@@ ely on spre@@ ad@@ she@@ ets , everything is nu@@ mer@@ ically expres@@ si@@ ble , and the amount you spend on something is propor@@ tion@@ ate to the scale of your success .
you &apos;ve got to just respon@@ d to the situation .
and i go , &quot; i &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
thank you very much .
i had met a group of children in the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an island of sa@@ in@@ t kit@@ ts , and i did work and play with them .
and i never found that . i found the best you could ever do was to get to zero .
so that &apos;s where a head@@ rest comes in .
this is the first night showing nat@@ ash@@ a her new cousins and un@@ cles and a@@ unts .
i asked her how long she plan@@ ned to live in the n@@ un@@ ner@@ y and she said , &quot; well , you know , of course , it &apos;s im@@ perman@@ ent , but my plan is to live here until i &apos;m 30 , and then enter a her@@ mit@@ age . &quot;
we started with the prescri@@ ption pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked , not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibio@@ tics , an inhal@@ er , medi@@ cation -- but what do patients need to be healthy , to not get sick in the first place ?
that &apos;s between , say at an average use , that &apos;s maybe 2@@ 5,000 to 10@@ 0,000 hom@@ es could run off that .
part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program , the other part thinks i can &apos;t be tru@@ sted with one .
it has 3@@ .@@ 4 times 10 to the 3@@ 8@@ th possible termin@@ ations .
by see@@ king the in@@ war@@ dness which is in all things .
is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , ro@@ tated ?
i &apos;m going to use them a different way . &quot;
for example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?
that &apos;s why you have to send your kids to good schools , hopefully eventually to oxford .
and those are the specific genes that diff@@ er from one to the other .
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lin@@ ed up i guess .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
and it doesn &apos;t just have to be addi@@ ction .
but it shows the intelligence that the eleph@@ ants have .
these are the di@@ stances of the tu@@ bes which make it walk that way .
thank you very much .
those are the things that are going to happen first .
and when you exp@@ and the box , the fir@@ ing location exp@@ ands .
and now we know that in our recent past it mel@@ ted back and for@@ med again , and sea level went up and down , six meters at a time .
almost everybody knows this , from no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates to golf cad@@ dies , or was taught it , as i was .
they used to ag@@ gre@@ gate up to the tens of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ pers about this big in one he@@ ct@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation .
and the studio ex@@ ecu@@ tives , they would say , &quot; hey , look at she@@ k@@ h@@ ar . he &apos;s so prepar@@ ed . &quot;
so , let &apos;s explore .
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a bil@@ l@@ board pain@@ ter .
nobody cri@@ tici@@ zes any op@@ ini@@ on .
they want to make people live in fear .
and so at the end of the day , i say , &quot; you know what ? i guess you &apos;re right . p@@ . &quot;
what does that mean ?
and if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shu@@ tter open , as long as your camera is atta@@ ched to the hu@@ b@@ ble space teles@@ cope , it will see something like this .
la@@ dies and gent@@ le@@ men , the creation of life .
in art school , phi@@ l hansen developed an un@@ ru@@ ly tre@@ mor in his hand that kept him from creating the poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ st dra@@ w@@ ings he loved . hansen was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated , floating without a sense of purpose . until a neurolog@@ ist made a simple sugge@@ sti@@ on : embra@@ ce this limit@@ ation ... and tran@@ sc@@ end it .
another char@@ is@@ matic me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ un@@ a species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale .
we &apos;re taking this data and building better models .
and i &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my pe@@ ers .
it starts with the global hu@@ bs .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
this is what the computer inter@@ face used to look like , do@@ s .
the point about democracy is not instru@@ mental .
now , africa is the most tropic@@ al continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and cap@@ ri@@ cor@@ n -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of gl@@ aci@@ ers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
my talent , my integri@@ ty , my values , everything about me re@@ ma@@ ined the same .
and let me give you a few illu@@ stra@@ tions .
let us attempt to read out memor@@ ies from conne@@ ct@@ om@@ es .
the big , real car works every time ; there &apos;s no problem about it .
but psycho@@ graphi@@ cs really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations .
never under@@ estimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a dest@@ ination .
mar@@ co tempest sp@@ ins a beautiful story of what magic is , how it enter@@ tains us and how it high@@ lights our humanity -- all while working extraordinary illu@@ sions with his hands and an au@@ g@@ mented reality machine .
tried to protect our equipment , tried to protect our staf@@ f and the villages of about 1,@@ 500 people .
all of this is part of our common experience , and this shouldn &apos;t surprise us , because , after all , bi@@ ologists have finally pro@@ ven it to be true , something that philosop@@ hers have always dre@@ am@@ t to be true .
and the women are di@@ li@@ gent . they are focused ; they work hard .
you hold on to the roots , you put your foot in the little rocks and cli@@ mb up there , and you get to the top , and i was with a good friend who was an actor , and we said , &quot; let &apos;s go up there .
and so , i remember night after night , you &apos;d hear all these men , these really har@@ den@@ ed cri@@ min@@ als , hu@@ dd@@ led around john james , re@@ c@@ iting , &quot; take that , spi@@ de@@ y ! &quot;
most recently i went in , and i started looking at some of the biggest industries in china .
so , ask yourself : is this person ever going to drive at a ste@@ ady 2@@ 8 miles per hour ? i don &apos;t think so .
you can see , it &apos;s always re@@ acting .
that signal was so strong , it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the se@@ di@@ ment , collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of astero@@ i@@ ds and com@@ et material .
many people worry that a universal morality would require moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no excep@@ tions .
there are a few key points .
i couldn &apos;t miss it . it was 2,@@ 200 acr@@ es in size : 2,@@ 200 acr@@ es in size , 2@@ ,000 years old .
the other thing is , we love bat@@ teri@@ es .
if you have not , you must learn about it . crea@@ ti@@ ve@@ common@@ s@@ .@@ or@@ g .
but in this century china is coming on line .
yet that is exactly what the american paradigm dem@@ ands .
no , i &apos;m looking actually at a special version of power@@ point over here , which shows me the sli@@ des ahead , the sli@@ des behind , my notes from here , so i can see what &apos;s going on .
they &apos;re actually about impro@@ ving houses .
supp@@ ose you and i have an argument .
and , you know , if you think about this with the tsun@@ ami , what you have is essentially a kind of an ar@@ my of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
now most people would answer gri@@ ll@@ ed , and it &apos;s true that gri@@ ll@@ ed chicken does con@@ tain less fat and fewer cal@@ or@@ ies .
what you &apos;re looking at here is an x-ray of the colum@@ n that you just saw , vie@@ wed from the top .
and para@@ g sha@@ h , another engineer , from mumbai , has un@@ b@@ und@@ led our projects into smaller , more mana@@ ge@@ able bit@@ es that he now ser@@ ves in his pion@@ e@@ ering do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself computer science program .
because we need a le@@ xic@@ on . what is a le@@ xic@@ on ?
so when you see how long it took to get an h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 vaccine out , we think we can shor@@ ten that process quite substan@@ ti@@ ally .
so we must find other solutions .
if you had a prescri@@ ption pad , if you had a nur@@ se , if you had a hospital that would give you a place to con@@ val@@ es@@ ce , maybe some basic tools , you really could do it all .
en@@ ligh@@ tened self-@@ interest , because if that economic diver@@ gence contin@@ ues for another 40 years , combined with social integration globally , it will build a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are for our children .
and a few years after i left , i went back , and the cha@@ ir@@ man of the burn de@@ part@@ ment was very excited to see me -- said , &quot; dan , i have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot;
thanks very much .
100 ven@@ d@@ ors were co@@ -@@ lo@@ cated ad@@ jac@@ ent to the plant , and innovative business models for automo@@ bile de@@ al@@ er@@ ships were developed .
so i immediately said , &quot; well , but you could not have been edu@@ cated in india , right ?
the ro@@ oms in this building are like is@@ lands in an archi@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and what that means is that mechan@@ ical engineers are like e@@ co@@ -@@ engineers , and they have the ability to structure biom@@ es in this building the way that they want to .
with en@@ de@@ aring hon@@ est@@ y and vulner@@ ability , ra@@ g@@ ha@@ va k@@ k tells the col@@ or@@ ful tale of how art has taken his life to new places , and how life experi@@ ences in turn have driven his multiple rein@@ car@@ nations as an artist -- from car@@ to@@ on@@ ist to pain@@ ter , media dar@@ ling to social out@@ cast , and son to father .
one could say this is about community , colle@@ ctivity .
the other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is cor@@ al b@@ lea@@ ching . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
the children had a name for me .
how did he die ?
right . there &apos;s a person at new@@ ca@@ st@@ le who has figured out that it &apos;s a very large neuron .
so they had quali@@ ties that -- they came close to -- as close to reach@@ ing possibly their full potential as any pla@@ yers i ever had .
because it &apos;s par@@ tly floating , you can imagine , is sea level ris@@ es a little bit , the ice lif@@ ts off the bed , and then it can break off and flo@@ at north .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
and that means we have to really increase effi@@ ci@@ ency even more .
and so , i supp@@ ose you want to know what my wish is .
after a couple of days , three days , you tend to re@@ bel in a lot of physical ways .
your work is highly sen@@ su@@ al , even he@@ don@@ istic .
but she said , as he came to die , he sat up on the side of the bed one day , and he asked the nur@@ se if he could see the ch@@ ap@@ la@@ in .
and each cloud is comp@@ ac@@ ted , gravi@@ ty gets more powerful as density increases , the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud , and then , at the center of each cloud , the temperature cros@@ ses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees , prot@@ ons start to f@@ use , there &apos;s a huge rele@@ ase of energy , and , b@@ am !
es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o : social experiments to fight poverty
i &apos;ve always been very worried about resour@@ ce .
they &apos;re the people who make the bul@@ let train .
but what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaph@@ ors and language ste@@ ers us towards certain con@@ cep@@ ts of ide@@ a-@@ creation .
but i had three days of life support , and everybody was expe@@ cting , due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn &apos;t going to make it , so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or po@@ op , and — — when i finally po@@ op@@ ed , then that somehow , sur@@ gi@@ cally speaking , that &apos;s like you cros@@ sed some good line , and , um — — on that day , the surgeon came in and whi@@ pped the she@@ et off of me .
he &apos;s a complete revolution@@ ary .
so , we made a section of the mam@@ mary gland of the mouse , and all those lovely ac@@ ini are there , every one of those with the red around them are an ac@@ in@@ us , and we said okay , we are going to try and make this , and i said , maybe that red stuff around the ac@@ in@@ us that people think there &apos;s just a struc@@ tural sc@@ aff@@ old , maybe it has information , maybe it tells the cells what to do , maybe it tells the nu@@ cle@@ us what to do .
you can make reas@@ on@@ able predi@@ ctions about how cars be@@ have .
you have the animal war@@ m@@ th of your family sitting right next to you , but you are also free to go ro@@ am@@ ing around the advent@@ ur@@ eland and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
and i re@@ called -- i was raised on a small farm in southern indi@@ ana and dad tried to teach me and my bro@@ thers that you should never try to be better than someone else .
we sat in a car on the a@@ venue pau@@ li@@ sta in s@@ ã@@ o pau@@ lo , together .
again though , to make it come alive you need , somehow , to add the human element .
so how do we make that actually work ?
and that is what has made it most fun .
one of them was &quot; car@@ men . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
and i love can@@ al@@ et@@ tos , because can@@ al@@ et@@ to has this fantastic detail , and you can get right up and see all the details on the pain@@ ting .
it &apos;s done , it &apos;s out , you &apos;re cu@@ red of cancer .
these are people who , being forced to oper@@ ate in a system that dem@@ ands ru@@ le-@@ following and creates incenti@@ ves , find away around the rules , find a way to sub@@ ver@@ t the rules .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the double heli@@ x of dna .
and while i &apos;ve tried to make my images not too graphic , keep in mind that surge@@ ons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do , because , after all , what a surgeon does to a patient , if it were done without con@@ sent , would be a fel@@ ony .
let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it rel@@ ates to power diff@@ u@@ sion and then pull these two types together .
and i sub@@ mit them , my intui@@ tions , my hypo@@ thesis , my first ideas .
so that &apos;s just to give a sense of scale .
so without a dou@@ bt , agriculture is the single most powerful force un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
you know we &apos;re being pen@@ etr@@ ated .
i saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
it learned to move and began to see . the first eyes grew on tri@@ lo@@ bit@@ es .
they won public op@@ ini@@ on over a long period of time .
end of story .
and not only that , i am docum@@ enting it -- docum@@ enting my own cultural shor@@ t@@ com@@ ings .
you know , you can feel it when you &apos;re just driving along in your car .
you don &apos;t need to know where these recei@@ vers are , and it doesn &apos;t matter if these recei@@ vers move -- just think of the ster@@ e@@ o in your car .
but there was no evidence .
and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching , whether it be in spor@@ ts , or whether it be in the english classroom .
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
this is an ou@@ tre@@ ach station condu@@ cted at a school for the blind .
and the second boy said , &quot; i bring you my@@ r@@ h@@ h . &quot;
and , you know , so he took me under his wing , and he en@@ coura@@ ged me .
the s@@ lau@@ ghter of millions in the tren@@ ches and in the death camp@@ s have caused people to ask , &quot; where is god in all this ?
and he would tell them , &quot; at the moment i dire@@ cted you in this way , and now that i am dire@@ cting you in this way , everything will be okay . &quot;
we &apos;re even seeing it in co@@ zy social democra@@ cies like swe@@ den , fin@@ land and germany .
they were in@@ ser@@ ting themselves into the hotel review , kind of trying to convince you they were there .
it fle@@ w in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for the cool new technology of that age , which was the x-ray machine .
so when i asked him , he told me three things .
and they were left behind , waiting to die .
it &apos;s also more than cat@@ alo@@ ging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them .
i mean , now we &apos;re talking about 100 mega@@ watts .
nar@@ ration : &quot; bud@@ ap@@ est . &quot;
a wise person knows when to impro@@ v@@ ise .
and we com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed them to make a ma@@ qu@@ et@@ te , or a b@@ ust , of ben@@ jam@@ in .
and under no load , it &apos;s one structure .
this man gave me his contact details at the end of the ev@@ ening and said , &quot; if you want to do this , call me . &quot;
so , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawa@@ ii without dro@@ pping in , i decided to cut this very big under@@ taking into three se@@ g@@ ments .
and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of impro@@ vis@@ ation and excep@@ tion@@ -@@ finding .
those three projects , they &apos;re based on very simple scientific phenomena , such as magne@@ tis@@ m , the sound wa@@ ves , or over here , the physical properties of a sub@@ stance , and what i &apos;m trying to do is i &apos;m trying to use these phenomena and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and therefore invi@@ te the vie@@ wer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us .
you should say , &quot; that &apos;s od@@ d . i thought i read that this demo@@ graphic , young men and women in their 20@@ s and 3@@ 0s , is largely illi@@ ter@@ ate in afghanistan . &quot;
thank you very much .
he &apos;s like our other children , but the experience is completely different .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael poll@@ an in which he argu@@ ed that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
learning between grown u@@ ps and kids should be reci@@ pro@@ cal .
and it works , not just for my wife , but certainly for other patients .
but they have life@@ like properties , is the point .
i grew up with this woman .

there &apos;s actually three base@@ ball fields on it right now , and they &apos;re going to stay there .
does it work ? do i like it ?
instead of showing an object from the stage i &apos;m going to do something special for the first time .
close your eyes right now .
because the idea of doing it alone terri@@ fi@@ es me .
so think about just a point to point movement .
that &apos;s it .
okay , i promised to ref@@ ute all these guys , and i don &apos;t have an awful lot of time left , but let me ref@@ ute a couple more of them .
total transfor@@ mation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food .
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves at a deep section , a chan@@ nel between us .
among all these experiments , there was one thing in common : i was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world .
well , that &apos;s not even the worst example in the world .
of course , here you don &apos;t feel the cold , or the heat -- you just see the possi@@ bilities .
and together with the metho@@ ds to date these genetic differences , this has led to the insight that modern humans -- humans that are essentially indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from you and me -- evolved in africa , quite recently , between 100 and 200@@ ,000 years ago .
open source production has shown us that worl@@ d-@@ class software , like lin@@ u@@ x and mo@@ z@@ illa , can be created with n@@ either the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic structure of the fir@@ m nor the incenti@@ ves of the market@@ place as we &apos;ve known them .
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
now i &apos;m not a gene@@ tic@@ ist , so i &apos;m not going to pre@@ tend to understand the genetics .
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that &apos;s off@@ ered is really in@@ effec@@ tual .
well , with the pig , at the bas@@ el@@ ine , before we blo@@ cked the pig &apos;s ar@@ tery to simul@@ ate a heart attack , that was the signal .
find these resources . apply them .
but this is just one of many neuro@@ mod@@ ul@@ ators that &apos;s in the fly &apos;s brain .
they thre@@ w these hand gren@@ a@@ des at inno@@ cent people as they sat eating in caf@@ es and wa@@ ited to cat@@ ch tra@@ ins on their way home from work .
al@@ ain de bot@@ ton .
how is it that the sun , 9@@ 3 million miles away , &#91; that &#93; somehow it affects the motion of the earth ?
we were a great model . so , i loved going to school .
on the hu@@ d@@ son river ?
you have to find some vision where you see how hope@@ ful it is , how it can be changed .
the see@@ ds are then planted , then grown .
i don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ sport . it &apos;s in the back of my pack .
recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which rele@@ ases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kills people .
the problem with questions is they create un@@ certain@@ ty .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
you can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing center . &quot;
you see here the work of ben fr@@ y . this is &quot; human v@@ s. chim@@ ps &quot; -- the few chromos@@ om@@ es that dist@@ ingu@@ ish us from chim@@ ps .
here is the actual robot .
and i gave the grand@@ mother my business card .
al-@@ je@@ b@@ r finally came into english as al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
thank you , les@@ lie , that was an insight that a lot of us haven &apos;t had before .
technology created by innovative companies will set us all free .
see , he ow@@ ned a chro@@ mi@@ um pl@@ ating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tan@@ ks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lif@@ ting .
remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
that &apos;s on the ch@@ amp@@ s-@@ el@@ y@@ sees .
we now know that there is a very bro@@ ad spectrum of auti@@ sm .
it flows down through delhi , ma@@ th@@ ur@@ a , a@@ gr@@ a , and gets just about every bit of eff@@ lu@@ ent you can imagine .
because , when i told her i was going out to play with the kids , i was going door to door in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood to collect co@@ at han@@ gers to put in the bas@@ ement to sell .
we know that hea@@ ther , his sister hea@@ ther , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug hab@@ it .
and i &apos;m pres@@ enting it here at ted . why ?
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of h@@ yp@@ e about our power to control biology .
you &apos;d think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn &apos;t be such su@@ ck@@ ers just for the pretty phones .
so in addi@@ tion to the full body , and in addi@@ tion to the voice , another thing that i &apos;ve been really interested in , most recently , is the use of the eyes , or the ga@@ ze , in terms of how people rel@@ ate to each other .
he wanted to test out the question of , where is it that patients should re@@ cover from heart attacks ?
i grew up in mobile , al@@ ab@@ ama -- somebody &apos;s got to be from mobile , right ? -- and mobile si@@ ts at the con@@ flu@@ ence of five ri@@ vers , for@@ ming this beautiful del@@ ta .
so i &apos;m just a law@@ yer , i look at this range of numbers , and i say it &apos;s fair for me to say it &apos;s .@@ 0@@ 5 percent who are our relevant f@@ unders in america .
can we create a perfect society ?
and i plu@@ cked the hair off the fly &apos;s head .
there it is mod@@ el@@ ed as it was developing into a piece of work .
then , unfortunately , the next sad part of the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ine story is that europe@@ ans arri@@ ved in 17@@ 8@@ 8 , and they brought with them the things they valu@@ ed , and that inclu@@ ded she@@ ep .
we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pres@@ sing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
they wanted to put an end to it . and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tra@@ cking chip inside one of these h@@ ump@@ back whales .
we can bring to an end the bloo@@ dies@@ t century that humanity has ever known .
and people were putting up signs in the real world -- -- about this whale .
and i will give you several examples .
and so , if you see that texas -- you know , texas and california are under canada , and that south carolina is on top of north carolina , this is the home that i grew up in , ok ?
if you take the ob@@ ese mouse and give it an angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or , it los@@ es weight .
so if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country , i know that se@@ b would love to hear from you about collabor@@ ating and getting that into your country .
this is her en@@ se@@ mble .
the texas tower mur@@ der@@ er opened my eyes , in re@@ tros@@ pe@@ ct , when we studied his tra@@ gic mass mur@@ der , to the importance of play , in that that individual , by deep study , was found to have sever@@ e play de@@ pri@@ vation .
let &apos;s look at the stock markets in africa .
and here &apos;s what the story is .
workers are treated as well or as bad@@ ly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot;
this is what we had in biology , just to repe@@ at .
so this was really interesting to me , this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life , and also ad@@ ding inter@@ activity to sc@@ ulp@@ ture .
but it takes a lot to get there .
she &apos;d never sat at a keyboard before .
the effort to do that almost broke the organization .
the other point that &apos;s worth notic@@ ing is how one-@@ dimensional this proje@@ ction is .
he said , &quot; the l@@ ord is my she@@ pher@@ d . &quot;
so i did a review of eth@@ ical dilemma and value confli@@ cts and mana@@ gement research , wrote , read about 100 pap@@ ers .
as prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers each and every one of us should stri@@ ve to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes .
what we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to re@@ build .
wel@@ come to thailand .
but -- i know it &apos;s the bottom line , or one &apos;s perception of it , that motiv@@ ates people in the end .
i tried to pro@@ ve that he didn &apos;t do that thing in the s@@ alt lake .
if i were to redu@@ ce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
py@@ ri@@ form silk gl@@ ands make the atta@@ ch@@ ment c@@ ement -- that &apos;s the silk that &apos;s used to ad@@ here silk lines to a sub@@ strate .
in this article , mr. sel@@ inger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him .
and this was a dog that put both his ow@@ ners in hospital , plus the bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , plus the child .
and this is because our kids are so valu@@ able , not just because of who they are , but because of us , because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection .
and the fundamental answer is that the pro-@@ a@@ ging tr@@ ance is not as du@@ mb as it looks .
but it &apos;s not just an alien inv@@ asi@@ on of intelligent machines .
there is re@@ de@@ mption . and there is res@@ ur@@ re@@ ction .
now this ide@@ ology gets poli@@ ced by this one very dangerous question , which is , &quot; what per@@ cent@@ age of my don@@ ation goes to the cause versus over@@ head ? &quot;
so , if anyone wants to join , the basic idea is , whether or not there is a god , there &apos;s something important and beautiful about the idea of sac@@ re@@ dness , and that our ritu@@ als can be sac@@ red .
but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to a few years back .
frei@@ t@@ as has a design for a robo@@ tic white blood cell .
i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children , but was going to have the same at@@ titude toward par@@ enting that i do , so somebody who was going to be totally okay with for@@ cing our child to start taking pian@@ o lessons at age three , and also maybe computer science clas@@ ses if we could w@@ ran@@ gle it .
and if we indeed need a big brother , i would much rather have a dom@@ esti@@ c big brother than a foreign big brother .
the main dri@@ ver of that is actually meat .
but in each case , i didn &apos;t design the form .
we have a battery bay . it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .
so , this represents -- this is a cros@@ s-@@ s@@ ample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world &apos;s greatest photo@@ journalists , working at the very top of their cra@@ ft -- except one .
so this will be the typical work@@ flow situation .
isn &apos;t it weird that my 4@@ 7@@ -year-old husband is forever los@@ ing the car ?
it &apos;s a company with one big custom@@ er .
it &apos;s kind of like this other level where you can &apos;t make choices anymore , and it &apos;s just your body re@@ acting to certain sounds in the music .
my skill is not in the mathematics .
well , that &apos;s just a my@@ th .
can we hold it together ?
so , huge things in construction , real e@@ state , mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge markets . financial services : we had 8@@ 9 ban@@ ks . too many not doing their real business .
and really one of the points of impro@@ v everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
pm : and did you get pus@@ h@@ back from making that a central ten@@ ant of foreign policy ?
come on . don &apos;t run away . come back . come back .
and these huge soldiers with their back@@ pac@@ ks and their body ar@@ mor , wo@@ b@@ bled to the ground .
and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therap@@ ies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth bir@@ th@@ day .
one more time , with feeling , la@@ dies and gent@@ le@@ men .
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
peter m@@ oly@@ neu@@ x : what are you going to do , di@@ mit@@ r@@ i ?
and maybe to put that in perspective : there &apos;s so much data on this , i &apos;ll be happy to give it to you in different forms .
i &apos;m starting the story with the first atom@@ ic bomb at trin@@ ity , which was the manhattan project . it was a little bit like ted : it brought a whole lot of very smart people together .
i throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
it fe@@ e@@ ds on dy@@ s@@ function .
it &apos;s free@@ zing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
the le@@ gen@@ ds that you see in the movie don &apos;t appe@@ ar for the mon@@ key .
hit@@ ler knew it ; he used wa@@ g@@ ner to make all the na@@ z@@ is feel wonderful and ar@@ y@@ an .
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal foot@@ ing with every other .
sound affects us physi@@ ologi@@ cally , psych@@ ologi@@ cally , cogni@@ tively and behavi@@ or@@ ally all the time .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
the solution , i think , is that we use language at two levels : the liter@@ al form signals the sa@@ fest relationship with the listen@@ er , whereas the imp@@ licated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listen@@ er to per@@ form -- allows the listen@@ er to deri@@ ve the interpre@@ tation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initi@@ ates a changed relationship .
and we try to guess what they &apos;re doing from their behavior on the surface .
the t@@ ap@@ es from my tv show weren &apos;t very useful because there were too many other kinds of audi@@ o involved -- movie so@@ und@@ tra@@ cks , for example , or gene s@@ is@@ kel argu@@ ing with me -- and my words often had a particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is that didn &apos;t fit into a sentence well enough .
but cu@@ tting into the b@@ ones of a dinosau@@ r is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in muse@@ ums b@@ ones are pre@@ cious .
now , i &apos;m also really big on photograph@@ y .
but maybe it &apos;s something different .
the@@ o j@@ an@@ sen : my cre@@ ations , a new form of life
re@@ mot@@ eness affects the quality of education .
so there &apos;s about 130 million books that have been written since the da@@ wn of time .
in buddh@@ ism , we say , &quot; it takes a strong back and a so@@ ft front . &quot;
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
so they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries .
and cy@@ ni@@ cs might say , you know , this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to ex@@ ec@@ ute his particular sty@@ le of marketing .
t@@ ying yourself to the ma@@ st is the ol@@ dest one , but there are other ones such as lo@@ cking a cre@@ d@@ it card away with a key or not bringing jun@@ k food into the house so you won &apos;t eat it or un@@ plu@@ g@@ ging your internet connection so you can use your computer .
dialog kept on going , with mental maps of words , and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being da@@ zz@@ led with brilli@@ ance , i was seriously being b@@ aff@@ led with bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it .
now that &apos;s not a happy situation for them , but they have the con@@ fi@@ dence and the courage to come forward and say , &quot; here &apos;s what we are measuring .
and i also was raised with personal examples of lea@@ der@@ ship .
ask me how later , particularly if you eat fish , interest@@ ingly enough , but that connection is there .
well , we used to use tra@@ mp@@ et@@ tes . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
and i look at a beautiful bo@@ w@@ l of fruit , and i look at a dres@@ s that i se@@ wed for friends of mine .
you take eight million trucks -- these are 18@@ -@@ wheel@@ ers -- and take them to natural gas , redu@@ ce carbon by 30 percent , it is che@@ aper and it will cut our im@@ por@@ ts three million bar@@ rel@@ s .
and he could still hold his wife &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do butt@@ ons on his clo@@ th@@ es , can &apos;t feed himself .
so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own .
that line is broken up into 3@@ 2 squ@@ ar@@ es .
this guy had met hit@@ ler and gandhi within six months , and every time i &apos;d ask him about it , he &apos;d say , &quot; oh , i just happened to be there .
so let &apos;s go back to ha@@ it@@ i for a moment .
technology is transforma@@ tional .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
this is not a fa@@ x , this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you &apos;re going through these libr@@ aries .
hyper@@ bo@@ lic over@@ kill is a way of taking ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to the absolute ultimate li@@ mit , just for the fun of it . this was a piece i did -- a bro@@ ch@@ ure again -- &quot; r@@ ms tyran@@ ni@@ c : the biggest thing in all the world . &quot;
george de me@@ stra@@ l -- this is not bu@@ gs all over a bir@@ ken@@ stock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in bur@@ rs , sort of little pri@@ ckly things , and from that came vel@@ cr@@ o .
lo@@ th@@ ar me@@ g@@ gend@@ or@@ fer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; genug ist genug ! &quot;
today we don &apos;t con@@ front the chaos of nature .
they laugh@@ ed . they dis@@ missed us .
i &apos;ll spend a fortun@@ e on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
the first follo@@ wer is what transfor@@ ms a l@@ one nu@@ t into a lea@@ der .
we can change the survival rates by doing some common@@ sensi@@ cal things . &quot;
and reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
fast food has taken over the whole country ; we know that .
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
they open doors , they drive my car , they mas@@ sage me , they will throw ten@@ nis balls , they will co@@ ok for me and serve the food .
you &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ig@@ ni@@ te the fire of change in the play revolution .
h@@ ans ros@@ ling re@@ fra@@ mes 10 years of un data with his spectacular visu@@ als , ligh@@ ting up an ast@@ on@@ ishing -- mostly un@@ repor@@ ted -- piece of fron@@ t-@@ pa@@ ge-@@ worthy good news : we &apos;re winn@@ ing the war against child mortality . along the way , he deb@@ un@@ ks one fla@@ wed approach to stat@@ s that bl@@ ots out such vital stories . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and one of the things that came out -- al@@ li@@ son , who actually nom@@ in@@ ated me , said something earlier on in a brain@@ stor@@ ming . she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic ent@@ ry into our psy@@ che through kids between grade four and six .
with much greater hu@@ mili@@ ty , he kno@@ cks again on the door .
we &apos;re not a mi@@ ra@@ cle , okay ?
this technology has become out@@ d@@ ated in our current world .
it &apos;s about desig@@ ning with people , and le@@ tting appropriate solutions emer@@ ge from within .
that ei@@ ff@@ el tower moment will break the cei@@ ling , these arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary cei@@ l@@ ings of hei@@ ght , and allow wood buildings to join the competition .
but , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper .
thank you .
that is to say , if we att@@ end to the other person , we auto@@ matically empath@@ ize , we auto@@ matically feel with them .
yves showed one of the power@@ -@@ gener@@ ating devices .
and by the way , it &apos;s continued to .
because our da@@ d@@ dies are our mi@@ rr@@ ors that we refle@@ ct back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here .
so 3@@ 3 of the st@@ ones are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed onto the n@@ ina , the pin@@ ta and the santa mar@@ ia and are spread in the new world .
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very cooper@@ ative animal .
ir@@ relevant .
guess what ?
well , you see the nice story of getting ri@@ cher and getting health@@ ier -- everyone did it at the cost of emis@@ sion of carbon di@@ oxide .
there &apos;s the grand@@ stand now .
i built it .
over 10@@ 0,000 children learn science this way .
they might say , &quot; i &apos;ve got a bit of ne@@ ct@@ ar . do you want to come and get it ? &quot;
i started life as a ban@@ ker .
so ro@@ v@@ s aren &apos;t new .
thank you .
and i can split the others . here is the south asi@@ an , ar@@ ab world .
and then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up .
in africa , epide@@ mi@@ ologists have not@@ ed for a long time that truck dri@@ vers and mi@@ gran@@ ts are more likely to be infe@@ cted than other people .
we are all very good at sus@@ pen@@ ding our dis@@ belief .
and then i measure its al@@ titude .
they had dep@@ lo@@ yed all the right incenti@@ ves , all the right incenti@@ ves . they paid professi@@ on@@ als to write and ed@@ it thousands of artic@@ les .
here &apos;s two creatures who &apos;ve never heard of eu@@ cli@@ d &apos;s parallel post@@ ulate -- didn &apos;t know it was impossible to viol@@ ate , and they &apos;re simply getting on with it .
in the modern day world , where time is pre@@ mi@@ um and bat@@ tle for subsi@@ st@@ ence is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably t@@ ough , the h@@ ap@@ less common man simply gives in and pa@@ ys the bri@@ be just to get on with life .
but i jo@@ ined the indian police service , and then it was a new pattern of poli@@ cing .
and , in fact , when we did some experiments looking at this , what we found is that 46 percent of the vari@@ ation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes .
so you have to give me one . you have to make a choice .
and keep an eye out for sharks .
can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning b@@ ent down to their child and hu@@ g@@ ged their child and said , &quot; de@@ ar , i &apos;ll be back later .
to go back to the legal context , at the s@@ ally cl@@ ar@@ k tri@@ al all of the lawyers just accep@@ ted what the exper@@ t said .
the problem is that we can create these large reser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
it hasn &apos;t changed as we were growing up .
but we &apos;re giving them practice becoming independent , which of course is our ultimate goal .
pm : but you do it for good reasons .
and essentially we are just an u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t-@@ walking , big@@ -@@ bra@@ ined , super@@ -@@ intelligent ape .
the reason i get person@@ ally pis@@ se@@ d-@@ off about running shoes is because i bought a million of them and i kept getting hurt .
i &apos;m going to talk about save more tomorrow .
so when i go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
in the last two to three years , we have reach@@ ed a ste@@ ady state of hiv epidemic in the world .
brilliant work .
didn &apos;t -- weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
and so that &apos;s the sort of sequence , and so i have a more arti@@ stic im@@ pression of this .
we &apos;re going to start with speech .
in order to profit from its oil it has to exp@@ ort it through tur@@ key or sy@@ ri@@ a , and other countries , and iraq itself .
so this alone was a huge vi@@ ctory .
if someone br@@ ings a law@@ suit over , &quot; a kid fell off the se@@ es@@ a@@ w , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter what happens in the law@@ suit , all the se@@ es@@ a@@ ws will disappear .
but seriously , actually , what you can see there , in a way that would be very hard to dete@@ ct otherwise , is re@@ ag@@ an rein@@ vent@@ ing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more inti@@ mate , much more fol@@ k@@ sy , much more tele@@ gen@@ ic -- con@@ tra@@ cting all those ver@@ bs .
in the mean@@ time , the hard thing to do is to be ready .
but we now stand on the ver@@ ge of another revolution in ge@@ olo@@ cation accur@@ acy .
he only says , &quot; we can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identi@@ ties come to a good relationship with them .
and secon@@ dly , i feel it &apos;s a great hon@@ or to kind of wind up this extraordinary gather@@ ing of people , these amazing talks that we &apos;ve had .
all right . those are rar@@ er clou@@ ds than the cir@@ rus , but they &apos;re not that rare .
if you are a n@@ ba player and you are always being compared to michael j@@ ord@@ an , you &apos;re going to look not so impres@@ sive .
the center for disease control in the u.@@ s .
and yet finally , we have the tools , which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them .
we are studying the toler@@ ances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your spe@@ e@@ ches and your writing . and then , often people say to me , &quot; well , ok , how do i know that this word is real ? &quot;
now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts on this design really push the innovation , because we had to hit such a low price point , because we had to make a device that could travel on many , many types of ter@@ rain but still be us@@ able in@@ doors , and be simple enough to repair , we ended up with a fundament@@ ally new product , a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn &apos;t changed in a hundred years .
you know the bi@@ ot@@ ech companies are actually going inside us and plan@@ ting their little fla@@ gs on our genes .
right ?
i &apos;m sure that reson@@ ates with some of the ted@@ sters .
they &apos;re immen@@ sely powerful social institutions and many of their fe@@ atures can be tra@@ ced back to earlier fe@@ atures that we can really make sense of by re@@ verse engineering .
vot@@ es can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find your@@ s when you look for it .
he became the cha@@ ir@@ man of the national aids commit@@ tee and increas@@ ed the budget fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ fold .
so then there was a lot more be@@ ers , and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mu@@ sta@@ che back .
it creates a reality of money , property , government , mar@@ ri@@ age , c@@ ern con@@ ferences , co@@ ck@@ tail par@@ ties and summer vac@@ ations , and all of those are cre@@ ations of consciousness .
but it has to be technological , so i &apos;ll talk about electr@@ os@@ ho@@ ck therapy .
and i suddenly got it , and i said , &quot; friend , by any chance are you trying to play this ? &quot;
we used to stay inside for re@@ cess , because outside was worse .
thanks .
re@@ m@@ br@@ and@@ t is a propa@@ gand@@ ist in the chri@@ sti@@ an view .
but life isn &apos;t really just about avo@@ i@@ ding death , is it ?
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
most people say they would .
oh , bar@@ ry , is there nothing you can &apos;t do ?
and on the basis of several points , the oceans are complex , and they &apos;re central to the life on earth .
&quot; now why does it do this , &quot; i hear you ask .
if you share a mar@@ ker with someone , it means you share an an@@ c@@ est@@ or at some point in the past , the person who first had that change in their dna .
so that &apos;s a really symbo@@ lic pa@@ sting , because that &apos;s the first one we did that you couldn &apos;t see from the city .
and the nur@@ se takes you into a room , and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medi@@ cin@@ es you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby , and you hear none of it .
take a bre@@ ath now .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
before i came down here , i looked it up on open@@ street@@ map the open@@ street@@ map &apos;s a map , but it &apos;s also a wi@@ k@@ i .
there &apos;s a relationship between the old and the new ; the new emer@@ ges from the context of the old .
this year &apos;s h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 threat was actually a human , avi@@ an , sw@@ ine mix@@ ture that ar@@ ose in mexico .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
but in the international real@@ m , where fis@@ hing and over@@ fis@@ hing has really gone wild , these are the places that we have to make hope spots in .
and i &apos;m not just an academic , i &apos;m a philosop@@ her , so i like to think that i &apos;m actually pretty good at argu@@ ing .
i &apos;m an individual . i &apos;m one person .
i &apos;ve got a real e@@ state problem .
you &apos;re be@@ tting your life on something -- you just better know why you &apos;re be@@ tting what you &apos;re be@@ tting on .
what &apos;s interesting , again , is that it self-@@ assem@@ bles .
thank you .
and for those who want to see more , i &apos;ve got my book down@@ sta@@ irs in the boo@@ k@@ shop .
i ended up nar@@ ro@@ wing the subject to mon@@ et &apos;s &quot; ha@@ yst@@ ac@@ ks . &quot;
you have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right .
i say , &quot; keep him alive if you can . &quot;
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing the one most important thing -- the decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page r@@ ank .
invest sustain@@ ably . maj@@ ora mentioned this .
and basically , the concept is , how do you repres@@ ent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surro@@ unds us onto a flat , port@@ able , two-@@ dimensional surface .
we just had a number of cameras out on the green@@ land ice she@@ et .
and it &apos;s how all of europe can shift to ren@@ e@@ w@@ able electricity .
and then you got the known un@@ know@@ ns , the things we know we don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m talking about the production of al@@ umin@@ um .
i travel beyond the surface and show something for what it &apos;s worth , for what it &apos;s really made of , how it really works .
like hunger and thir@@ st , it &apos;s almost impossible to stam@@ p out . &quot;
it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago .
d@@ g : ah , for you in per@@ su@@ ading them .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
so when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff wh@@ en@@ ever they want .
they wanted to sti@@ r up contro@@ ver@@ sy .
i was , by the way -- i &apos;m an es@@ sex la@@ d , born and raised in es@@ sex in the u.@@ k .
it was life itself . i realized that this wasn &apos;t just my pain .
the last thing i remember was lying on a white b@@ lan@@ k@@ et , telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again , and to please try and save my voice .
thanks .
deep in a remote region of c@@ amer@@ o@@ on , two h@@ unter@@ s stal@@ k their pre@@ y .
hope for the best .
now what &apos;s the right response to that ? &quot; yeah , right ! &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve got more sharks and you &apos;ve got ti@@ gers . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i do . yes , i do . &quot; and i was so re@@ lie@@ ved that it was a question i could answer so quickly .
because i have some limited time , i &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it &apos;s good for .
it looks like a fair@@ ly simple thing , but this was a half a million dollar project ?
you simply take the pro@@ ton , and you hit it really shar@@ p@@ ly with an electr@@ on .
we fit in an led light bul@@ b , worth three u.s. dollars , put in our signal process@@ ing technology .
now , i don &apos;t know how many of you have ever done that with your kids , but if you do , please trust me , it &apos;s the most pressure you can put on a child , to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .
and the reason that &apos;s been held up is essentially by community ou@@ tra@@ ge that they &apos;re not re-@@ opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .
these kinds of things .
and so i looked up what the economy was paying for the war in iraq in the same year .
and then you might get something .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
depression , for example , is the thir@@ d-@@ leading cause of dis@@ ability , al@@ ong@@ side conditions such as di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia in children .
i will not l@@ end my name nor my rhyth@@ m to your beat .
the through@@ put rate right now is 1.@@ 5 million nets , three million by the end of the year .
my colleagues , compar@@ ing com@@ position of chemical elements in different gal@@ ac@@ tic stars , actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy .
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broad@@ band conne@@ ctivity .
as one of my great heroes , car@@ l sa@@ g@@ an , said , these are the things -- and actually , not only these , but i was looking around -- these are the things , like satur@@ n v ro@@ ckets , and sputnik , and dna , and liter@@ ature and science -- these are the things that hydro@@ gen atom@@ s do when given 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years .
mars has the largest vol@@ can@@ o in the solar system , oly@@ m@@ pus mon@@ s .
one thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater .
i co@@ -@@ fo@@ unded a company called navi@@ gen@@ ics , where , if you sp@@ it into a tube -- and we can look look at 3@@ 5 or 40 genetic mark@@ ers for disease , all of which are del@@ ay@@ able in many of the cancers -- you start to identi@@ fy what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
what you see is it takes steps back@@ wards , it tries to counter@@ -@@ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it &apos;s going to land .
but the problem is , we have a system that is completely -- basically pro@@ mot@@ ed this .
how do you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le the two things ?
jo@@ e , thank you very much .
that &apos;s very nice about them .
but the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is swe@@ ep@@ ing the middle east at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world , for the west and the east , to see st@@ ability and to see security and to see fri@@ end@@ ship and to see toler@@ ance emerging from the ar@@ ab world , rather than the images of violence and terrorism .
it was right at 20 m@@ h@@ z , so you could pick it up really easily , because they were afraid that people would think it was a ho@@ a@@ x , basically .
you know , rocket designers who use solar pan@@ els or fuel cells , i mean a few watts or kilo@@ watts -- wow , that &apos;s a lot of power .
they &apos;re cli@@ mb@@ ing up a wall , or a tree .
this sound colors our first im@@ pression of any room ; it can &apos;t be helped .
i &apos;m not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating . i do wee@@ ken@@ ds , and what i do -- i do even more than that , obviously , co@@ ach people -- but i &apos;m into immer@@ sion . because how did you learn language ?
and by 19@@ 50 , they were everywhere .
and rele@@ asing this caused wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
i &apos;d like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy , and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they &apos;re communic@@ ating with other people outside of science .
so if i cover my left eye -- i &apos;m talking about me person@@ ally , not all of you -- if i cover my left eye , i look at the grid -- pretty much like the one i &apos;m showing you .
and haw@@ kes : &quot; it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean . &quot;
a female child born tomorrow , on average -- medi@@ an -- will live to age 8@@ 3 .
there are an awful lot of things that you &apos;d like to dist@@ ingu@@ ish among .
but only about 20 percent of that , or 60 billion dollars , goes to health and human services caus@@ es .
gor@@ ill@@ as and or@@ an@@ gu@@ t@@ ans , for instance , afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating , and that seems to be about as much as they can do .
sal@@ mon swim up@@ stream to get to their spa@@ w@@ ning grounds , and lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ kes com@@ man@@ de@@ er a pas@@ sing ant , cra@@ w@@ l into its brain , and drive it up a bla@@ de of gr@@ ass like an all-@@ ter@@ rain vehicle .
so i &apos;d di@@ p my hands in paint , and i just attac@@ ked the can@@ v@@ as , and i actually hit so hard that i bru@@ is@@ ed a jo@@ in@@ t in my pin@@ k@@ ie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks .
it &apos;s also mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty .
how do you get to build those relationships ?
i really ap@@ ologi@@ ze to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don &apos;t .
if the weal@@ th@@ y countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis .
and the last one i &apos;ve already mentioned , that fell to you .
when people don &apos;t take their p@@ ills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
their videos that they use are inter@@ cut with photographs of men and women and children dying in iraq and afghanistan and in pakistan .
standard char@@ tered has brought in 1@@ 40 million .
and then you want to make sure that this separ@@ ation is within accep@@ table levels .
we have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking .
as part of s@@ elling , i was able to docum@@ ent the hard core evidence .
you know , if you fall in love with a fro@@ g , that &apos;s it .
and i said , &quot; a psychop@@ ath . &quot;
and i could see why he thought , you know -- it was so beauti@@ fully done .
and we created electric miles .
but even sometimes a che@@ aper version can actually have some char@@ ming aspects , can brea@@ the a little extra life into a dying trend .
the bus was done with a car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning x-ray machine , which is used on the bor@@ ders between countries , looking for contr@@ ab@@ and and il@@ legal im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts .
i found this passion not far from here , actually , when i was nine years old .
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ tern@@ ally w@@ rap the pi@@ p@@ e .
this is coming from the heart of fin@@ ance .
but still , will the society , would they ac@@ cept such a radi@@ cal idea ?
i &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mor@@ n@@ ings .
gor@@ don brown : i think it is about global citi@@ zen@@ ship . it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing our responsi@@ bilities to others .
so they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions , and are actually quite quick to point out when they &apos;re broken .
and if we are , are we ready to i@@ ter@@ ate , monit@@ or and provide feedback , make sure these promis@@ es are really deli@@ ver@@ ing results ?
and the people can hold their heads up high .
they cannot differ@@ enti@@ ate sound quality differences between those two clips .
collabor@@ ates with anima@@ tor andrew park to illu@@ strate den@@ is du@@ tt@@ on &apos;s pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive theory on beauty -- that art , music and other beautiful things , far from being simply &quot; in the eye of the be@@ hol@@ der , &quot; are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary orig@@ ins .
the notion is that it &apos;s going to transp@@ ort you , and the story is not about , you know , the guy in front of you in the air@@ plane , who has this na@@ sty little kid , or the big c@@ ough .
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
don &apos;t bring your measuring stick . &quot;
by inspi@@ ring ourselves we inspi@@ re others .
this real sense of ali@@ en@@ ation from the part of us that made a decision we regret .
and that &apos;s because if you take a brain out of the sk@@ ull and you cut a thin sli@@ ce of it , put it under even a very powerful micros@@ cope , there &apos;s nothing there .
it &apos;s a tar@@ get in the th@@ al@@ am@@ us .
and i knew that there had to be a way to prevent this .
so , a first idea is to use it on c@@ ab@@ in@@ et doors .
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich , they are looking down through the glas@@ s-@@ bottom bo@@ ats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through e@@ ter@@ nity .
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly like a bird .
that &apos;s a real un@@ comfortable feeling , when all the equipment &apos;s come out and a whole son@@ y team , and people are going to be sitting there in the audience .
he can , very innova@@ tively , actually change keys without ris@@ king huge dis@@ son@@ ances .
it did not cor@@ rel@@ ate with the quality of the infrastructure .
actually , i think it &apos;ll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that &apos;s emer@@ ged in the past century .
but that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
the hac@@ ker is absolutely central to many of the political , social and economic issues aff@@ ecting the net .
but are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individuals concer@@ ned or indeed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequence ?
so as you se@@ tt@@ led into rela@@ x@@ ation at the end of a hard day , on the cou@@ ch in our office , the music would mel@@ low with you .
compared to your regular friends , they are bor@@ ing and d@@ ull , right ? because in this new context , the compar@@ is@@ on is very , very different . in fact , you find yourself dis@@ li@@ king them enough almost to quali@@ fy for french citi@@ zen@@ ship .
ar@@ th@@ ur ben@@ jam@@ in : the magic of fibon@@ acc@@ i numbers
we can all watch how a fantastic ath@@ le@@ te or a fantastic perfor@@ mer can today lever@@ age his or her skills across the global economy as never before .
i &apos;ll give you an analo@@ g@@ y .
now this may sound arro@@ gant , or even full of hu@@ br@@ is .
oh my goo@@ dness . i am not that person . i am nice .
so , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?
i was going through a lot of personal problems at the time .
not all of them have happy end@@ ings .
and , to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for part@@ ner@@ ships between nations : cases where nations work together , in effect , de fac@@ to , the way china and britain worked together to build , first a little en@@ c@@ la@@ ve of the market model , and then scale it throughout china .
and i think when you look at the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
why does that matter ?
all of the great dis@@ ney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and re@@ mixed them , or wa@@ ited until they entered the public domain to re@@ mix them , to cele@@ bra@@ te this ad@@ d-@@ on re@@ mix creativity .
and where did that come from ? it came from it@@ al@@ y .
that &apos;s from a whole cat@@ alo@@ g -- it &apos;s 18 pa@@ ges or so -- ran back in the days of the lam@@ po@@ on , where i cut my teeth .
there was cri@@ tic@@ ism too because they said , &quot; pla@@ yers are being bought and sold ?
we took our clu@@ es from mother nature .
so for six days , i lived in front of a web@@ c@@ am .
we &apos;re just pushing the body through the whole ct scan@@ ner , and just in a few seconds we can get a ful@@ l@@ -@@ body data set .
so you imagine , if we &apos;re able to create a self-@@ susta@@ ining arti@@ ficial life form , not only will this tell us about the orig@@ in of life -- that it &apos;s possible that the universe doesn &apos;t need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything -- we can then take &#91; it &#93; one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition .
dur@@ k@@ heim believed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us takes on an air of sac@@ re@@ dness .
s@@ j : no one in the audience ?
and the second thing they said : and we trust you , that no matter where you are or where you go , you will always do the right thing .
so , this is a pretty gri@@ m picture .
and so he took me through the initi@@ ation ritual for a b@@ am@@ ana pri@@ est .
we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem .
and yet , every year at least 25 million children do not get the imm@@ uni@@ zation they should get .
so we scan@@ ned their brains , looking at a photograph of their s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and looking at a neu@@ tra@@ l photograph , with a di@@ stra@@ ction task in between .
a@@ o : who is this ?
or when you over@@ eat because your feel@@ ings are hurt , or whatever .
then the key to the my@@ ster@@ y could lie in the stati@@ st@@ ical properties of the multi@@ verse .
the reason for that is that these charac@@ ters are actually not real charac@@ ters .
so that is a non-@@ zero-@@ sum dynamic .
you think ted is hard to organize . right ?
so i &apos;m going to show you a few of the projects that i &apos;ve been working on over the last couple years that refle@@ ct on our lives and our systems .
so how do we do that ?
in the bab@@ ies of those women who developed po@@ st-@@ trau@@ matic stress syndro@@ me , or p@@ ts@@ d , following their or@@ deal , researchers discovered a biological mar@@ ker of sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to p@@ ts@@ d -- an effect that was most pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced in in@@ fan@@ ts whose mothers experi@@ enced the cat@@ astrop@@ he in their third tri@@ me@@ ster .
reali@@ zing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
j@@ ab@@ bar : we &apos;re here to help you .
these are one of the guys i work with . this is a brown cap@@ u@@ ch@@ in mon@@ key .
en@@ list the children in their own up@@ bringing .
the space between buildings will be well-@@ bal@@ an@@ ced between people and cars .
and i thought , in the beginning -- i studied this bird for a couple of years -- that , well , shouldn &apos;t the brain of this bird be da@@ ma@@ ged ?
they don &apos;t spend time alone .
so they &apos;re working on en@@ han@@ cing everything : touch , sm@@ ell -- everything they can , in order to find the perfect mate .
you don &apos;t know how hard it is to ear@@ n money . your dad works so hard .
and i can &apos;t help but enjoy looking at everything in the world .
we atta@@ ch a trans@@ du@@ cer , in this case , to the brain , but if it will be a different organ , it will be a different trans@@ du@@ cer atta@@ ched to the patient .
and the 16@@ mm black@@ -@@ and-@@ white film gave a different feel to it .
this is what happens when we con@@ f@@ use morality with fru@@ g@@ ality .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
and the reason is that you take it for granted .
the electr@@ on@@ ics behind the one laptop per child are based on am@@ d technology ; it &apos;s a micro@@ process@@ or .
just a wonderful kind of break@@ up of architecture , and the way that the trees form ver@@ tical elements .
it &apos;s not in their taste , really . it &apos;s not in their tex@@ ture .
he looked at the hu@@ t . we went inside .
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field micro@@ biolog@@ ist ?
of course , i had no inten@@ tion of doing that , and i kept speaking out about the environment , and it really was the topic that we now today call sustain@@ ability .
and you can notice they have created a kind of fal@@ se cat@@ ch@@ ment .
in another south indian village , these boys here had assem@@ bled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bu@@ mble be@@ e .
i gave a talk on un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive vie@@ wing and op@@ tical l@@ uring of deep sea squid in which i em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed the importance of using quiet , un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive plat@@ forms for expl@@ or@@ ation .
they were to be his se@@ ed group , his future fore@@ men .
now as we pull away from this world -- we &apos;re going to keep pulling away from the star now .
govern@@ ance , well it &apos;s fun to vote in a little thing , but it &apos;s not a goal .
answer is 26 percent .
they &apos;re kind of like the super@@ heroes of material science .
you were all over the place .
because that &apos;s what they called them .
so you &apos;re probably all wondering : the cave .
to@@ es have become an origami me@@ me , because everyone &apos;s doing it .
and we need a lot of sun@@ light in this trou@@ bled world .
my sister was different .
computer graphi@@ cs tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer paul de@@ be@@ ve@@ c expla@@ ins the scen@@ e-@@ ste@@ aling technology behind digital e@@ mi@@ ly , a digit@@ ally constru@@ cted human face so reali@@ stic it stands up to multiple takes . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facili@@ ties .
so , some people will say , oh , my god , are we playing god ?
there is the color red and the color black , repres@@ enting the const@@ ant change from day to night .
for a kid at that age , this was like infin@@ ite speed , disappe@@ aring , and i was very inspired by that .
there is such a thing as a k@@ ne@@ e org@@ as@@ m in the liter@@ ature .
and these were important lessons to me when i sub@@ sequ@@ ently became a professional art histor@@ ian .
in the case of h@@ are , it &apos;s an ambigu@@ ous sound in english .
they didn &apos;t buy it .
now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to redu@@ ce the negative con@@ sequences of this sort of noise and vari@@ ability .
so we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the student volunte@@ ers with paper tu@@ bes , just a very simple shel@@ ter out of the tube frame and the cur@@ tain .
and when i talk about dar@@ win@@ ian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fit@@ test .
now at the end of my te@@ a with se@@ ba@@ sti@@ an , he told me how , on a bad , ra@@ iny day , when he hasn &apos;t had a custom@@ er in his boo@@ k@@ store , he thinks of all the people around the world who &apos;ve said something wonderful about him , and what that says about him as a person .
our leaders are working ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to try and find ways to save money .
and that poor country runs off that ledge , does that car@@ to@@ on thing and then dro@@ ps .
well , again , what &apos;s interesting here is we &apos;ve lost to the russi@@ ans on the first couple of mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones already .
anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back .
but the prin@@ cess continued whist@@ ling .
this , in fact , is not the ti@@ tle of this piece .
oh my god .
so he would have a ful@@ l@@ ness of sound that those of you in the front few ro@@ ws wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few ro@@ ws wouldn &apos;t experience either .
when eric dis@@ h@@ man was in college , doctors told him he had 2 to 3 years to live . that was a long time ago . now , dis@@ h@@ man puts his experience and his exper@@ ti@@ se as a medical tech speci@@ alist together to suggest a b@@ old idea for rein@@ vent@@ ing health care -- by putting the patient at the center of a treatment team .
and with that entire wealth of england , king henry could not buy any antibio@@ tics , he could not buy re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles .
so , we want to build a 30 meter teles@@ cope .
and then you go a little crazy , and so you do various op@@ tical components or you do micro@@ pris@@ m ar@@ ra@@ ys , like the refle@@ ctive tape that you have on your running shoes .
so he could actually see things in the go@@ g@@ gles .
here &apos;s a great example from history . i &apos;ve heard this at@@ tribu@@ ted to several other k@@ ings , but doing a bit of historical research , it seems to be fre@@ dri@@ ck the great .
he had one look at the soil and said , &quot; forget it . no way .
and it &apos;s sort of a metaph@@ or for me for the virtual world .
as a result of these eff@@ or@@ ts , and the help of many others , it happened .
something else is going on .
this is basically air@@ -@@ hand@@ ling .
she belie@@ ves , &quot; yes , this is it , this is what my dest@@ iny is about . &quot;
so all the ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely deta@@ iled calcul@@ ations we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
and every year i go there and make a map of my study site .
and here is the fl@@ ot@@ sam near california state university long be@@ ach and the dies@@ el plant we vis@@ ited yesterday .
now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in either case it &apos;s real .
but the point is , if it &apos;s a production tool , why do we have to worry about that ?
the collapse in bio@@ diversity , climate change , pande@@ mi@@ cs , financial cris@@ es : these will be the currency that we will think about .
that &apos;s inter@@ ference . communication requ@@ ires sending and recei@@ ving , and i have another whole tedtalk about the importance of conscious listening , but i can send as well as i like , and you can be brilliant conscious listen@@ ers .
no s@@ alt , no pe@@ pp@@ er , no oil , no sp@@ ices .
we don &apos;t know how many planets there are in the universe , but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20 , or 100 billion billion .
and there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action .
we started a childhood o@@ bes@@ ity initiative with the heart associ@@ ation in america .
and in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of in@@ je@@ ctors ever became infe@@ cted with hiv .
you know , you hear , &quot; can organic feed the world ? &quot;
w@@ u ch@@ un@@ ming : &quot; even if i make a lot of money , it won &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ fy me .
so , the thing is , our historical l@@ ore , because of the way we like nar@@ ra@@ tives , are full of vast charac@@ ters such as , you know , ho@@ ward schul@@ tz of star@@ bucks and ray kro@@ c with mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s and as@@ a ch@@ and@@ ler with co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a .
around 18@@ 50 , one of the biggest u.s. industries was wh@@ aling .
you can &apos;t type very much on this .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
in a hospital , this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .
and he &apos;s &#91; unclear &#93; following that van that &apos;s out in front of him .
and the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large docum@@ entation systems over computer networks .
and what i was curious about -- because histor@@ ically , the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wa@@ sted -- and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .
can be worse , can be better .
certainly , in the last 15 years , we &apos;ve seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being con@@ fir@@ med , and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the si@@ z@@ e-@@ class of earth has actually been found .
well , ac@@ knowledge them .
so it was trau@@ ma@@ ti@@ zing , actually .
he was totally sto@@ ic . i couldn &apos;t see a twi@@ tch of his eye@@ bro@@ w .
and they can la@@ ther , rin@@ se , repe@@ at . and before you know it , you have a general sense of where everything is .
work ! ru@@ per@@ t mur@@ doch said to me , &quot; it &apos;s all hard work .
and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
i &apos;m going to tell you about one of the world &apos;s largest problems and how it can be solved .
that &apos;s nothing new : that &apos;s a prop@@ eller clo@@ ck ; that &apos;s the ri@@ ms that you can buy for your car .
and these tend to be some of the most independent , ten@@ aci@@ ous , intui@@ tive , you know , inven@@ tive people you will ever meet .
it begins with the mur@@ der of an inno@@ cent human being , and it &apos;s followed by a tri@@ al where the mur@@ der@@ er is con@@ vi@@ cted and sent to death row , and that death sentence is ultimately u@@ ph@@ el@@ d by the state app@@ ell@@ ate cour@@ t .
so how on earth do we even see ?
and the whole thing just fell together .
the big brain integr@@ ates signals , which come from the running programs of the lower brain , but sub@@ su@@ mption means that the higher brain can inter@@ f@@ ere with the lower .
and our lan@@ der is saf@@ ely tu@@ cked inside what we call an aer@@ os@@ hell .
and in order for the p@@ s@@ a to go down , they had to make pretty big changes .
and so in my life , i &apos;ve discovered that vac@@ ation is the most important skill for any kind of over@@ -@@ achie@@ ver .
so that &apos;s my story . to be continued .
perhaps ben z@@ ander and bill gates could get together and make an opera about aids .
these are -- do you want to hold that actually ?
mal@@ col@@ m glad@@ well : choice , happiness and spa@@ gh@@ ett@@ i sauce
so i didn &apos;t think much about it .
give it another try .
around the same time , i was going through an audi@@ tion -- the first ever open audi@@ tion by national television in china -- with another thousand college girls .
and the same with , for instance , te@@ tr@@ is , original version , the so@@ vi@@ et one .
now , 10@@ 0,000 feet , if you fly cros@@ s-@@ country to los angeles , you fly 3@@ 7@@ ,000 feet .
this is such a new area , and as we say back in brooklyn , you ain &apos;t seen no@@ thin &apos; yet .
so right now the web is parti@@ tion@@ ed into multiple languages .
all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master .
however , not one of you got out of your se@@ ats to think , &quot; right ! how can i c@@ la@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
so in this case , if you look carefully , most of the arro@@ ws flow from right to left .
so if i have a terri@@ fic experience and i t@@ we@@ et it , or i tell five people standing next to me , news tra@@ vels .
this is the only project that we &apos;ve done where the finished thing looked more like a ren@@ der@@ ing than our ren@@ der@@ ings .
so we developed the angel@@ med guar@@ dian system and we have a device inside this patient , called the im@@ planted angel@@ med guar@@ dian .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
and the great thing is there &apos;s no trick like with the glass cei@@ ling .
joseph n@@ ye : global power shif@@ ts
