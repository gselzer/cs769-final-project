and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater , incredible wild@@ life and interesting behavi@@ ors .
in suther@@ land &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
and because of the super-@@ absor@@ ben@@ cy of this kind of cell@@ u@@ lose , it just takes one , and a really short one at that .
for example , this garden spider can make seven different kinds of sil@@ ks .
and , un@@ certain .
they saw this actually solving a problem : this ability to differenti@@ ate compon@@ ents but keep them synthetic .
we have 8@@ 1 units of local government .
there are thousands of me@@ mes that come out of the site .
so in many ways , i think of the cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen con@@ sen@@ sus and the whole discussion of pri@@ orities as a defen@@ se for boring problems .
so , i don &apos;t tell you that to bra@@ g ; i tell you because i &apos;m proud of human beings , because they get excited to contribu@@ te once they &apos;ve had the chance to experience it , not talk about it .
next up is knowledge .
so , to find out that there was no sant@@ a cl@@ aus at all was actually sort of a re@@ lief .
i &apos;ve got to say , one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to , and i want to introduce you to one of those .
we need a new min@@ d@@ set . the world is conver@@ ging , but -- but -- but not the bottom billion .
i s@@ lam@@ med on the bra@@ kes .
so the cam@@ bri@@ an explosion , when all the body plan@@ s of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
you then have to introduce the mosquit@@ oes , and you have to model that and how they come and go .
vote with your wal@@ lets .
this is far too simpli@@ stic .
the water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way up@@ stream .
what are the charac@@ teri@@ stics of this top qu@@ arti@@ le ?
we &apos;re human beings .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
and if you give them drugs that are dop@@ am@@ ine an@@ tag@@ oni@@ sts , they go away .
now i may have used a t@@ one which was more like a d@@ are than a requ@@ est — — but nonetheless , it &apos;s to this man &apos;s cre@@ dit and his courage that he said , &quot; yes , i will . &quot;
so one evening , he said , &quot; look , you are doing all these things , but isn &apos;t it nice , also , to build something within ? &quot;
this takes the water out of the restaurant , r@@ uns it through these stone be@@ ds -- this is going to be min@@ t in there -- and i sort of water the garden with it .
even the pen@@ cil .
you gla@@ ze over with it .
in other words , we have possibly st@@ um@@ bled upon the hol@@ y gra@@ il of modern day planet@@ ary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is poten@@ tially su@@ itable for living organisms .
and so , some@@ time ago , i got this idea for a camera system .
they were ti@@ red of tre@@ a@@ ties .
wake up .
and so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
and the atoms themselves are quite violent , but if you fire las@@ ers that are precisely tun@@ ed to the right frequ@@ ency , an atom will brie@@ fly absor@@ b those phot@@ ons and tend to s@@ low down .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
i work for the new yorker , and i do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and u@@ tter end of the world as we knew it .
and , in a moment , we &apos;re going to see a view of the air@@ flow .
they also learn to follow other people &apos;s ga@@ ze , because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about .
and when they eat the seeds , their fo@@ ie gras turns yellow .
so humans are turning more towards animal consumption .
the digital revolution , yes .
we want kids to think , i &apos;m the hero in waiting , waiting for the right situation to come along , and i will act her@@ o@@ ically .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musi@@ cal score .
and so at the time that we were doing this research , i was car@@ ing for a 2@@ 9 year-old fire@@ figh@@ ter from conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut who was very much at the end of life with this in@@ cur@@ able cancer .
now , from k@@ han acade@@ my , we saw that short 10@@ -@@ minute videos worked much better than trying to record an h@@ our@@ -@@ long le@@ cture and put it on the small@@ -@@ format screen .
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very famous in ic@@ eland , went to ic@@ eland and spoke about this issue .
now , they will also de@@ fe@@ cate in certain areas .
i &apos;ve been a huge f@@ an of enter@@ prise and entrepreneur@@ ship since 1993 .
by the way , the wa@@ ges for libr@@ ari@@ ans went up faster than the wa@@ ges for other jobs in the u.s. over that same time period , because libr@@ ari@@ ans became part@@ ners of computers .
what you have here is an electron@@ ic ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te .
mosquit@@ oes actually live ... their day-@@ to-@@ day nutri@@ tion comes from ne@@ ct@@ ar , from flo@@ wers -- in fact , in the lab , we feed ours rais@@ ins -- but the female needs the blood meal .
my american ro@@ om@@ mate was sho@@ cked by me .
you can see europe is ab@@ la@@ ze with up@@ dat@@ es .
how does that work ? &quot;
but the cool part is the us@@ er inter@@ face .
well , after -- -- that &apos;s the truth .
well , it &apos;s dam@@ n hard doing the calcu@@ lations , that &apos;s the problem .
today , you hear these in@@ fern@@ al machines going night and day .
i began to hallu@@ cin@@ ate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads .
they made bigger g@@ uns to shoot them down with .
i think some people agree with me .
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that caf@@ e@@ teria , man .
what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man &apos;s safety net , the best invest@@ ment , is school feeding .
we bring mothers who have hiv , who &apos;ve been through these p@@ mt@@ ct programs in the very facili@@ ties , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nur@@ ses as part of the health care team .
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand .
david camer@@ on : the next age of government
so , the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself .
because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
we had fantastic friends and we saw the won@@ ders of the world , like ki@@ li@@ man@@ j@@ ar@@ o , seren@@ get@@ i and the ol@@ du@@ va@@ i gor@@ ge .
who &apos;s got the work eth@@ ic now ?
those are cap@@ tured in the char@@ ter .
so that if you sit down on my chair , whether you &apos;re five feet t@@ all or six foot six , it always de@@ als with your weight and trans@@ f@@ ers the amount of force requi@@ red to re@@ c@@ line in a way that you don &apos;t have to look for something to adjust .
and if you look at this photograph car@@ efully , the bottom half of this is rather brown .
that was pac@@ i@@ fic pal@@ isa@@ des ; it probably is still there , back there .
we made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert .
you get gras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots solutions , things that work for people who have no capital or limited access .
i feel that , if we can understand what makes something like coca-cola ubi@@ quit@@ ous , we can apply those lessons then for the public good .
the phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical industry is in deep trouble .
they discovered that ad@@ ult cells , taken from you and me , could be re@@ programm@@ ed back into em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic@@ -@@ like cells , which they ter@@ med i@@ ps cells , or indu@@ ced pl@@ uri@@ po@@ tent stem cells .
they re@@ mind us that we can change the world if we de@@ fy the impossible and we re@@ fu@@ se to fear failure .
and i &apos;d like to thank chris for this opportunity to un@@ v@@ eil our technology with you , and soon the world .
so , what is the social result of this ?
not only has that been we@@ ak@@ . it &apos;s getting we@@ ak@@ er .
there &apos;s also the six emotions and that el@@ u@@ sive x-@@ factor .
it was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for glam@@ ori@@ zing violence , because , look -- sun@@ glas@@ ses and those long co@@ ats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
and also you want something that fre@@ es your eyes .
i don &apos;t know . maybe . who knows ?
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ en@@ cies , but i can &apos;t imagine that every apartment having its own air condi@@ tion@@ er is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering , but sur@@ ely when their minds are stra@@ ying away from something that wasn &apos;t very enjo@@ y@@ able to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us .
thank you .
it &apos;s one we have to ask , and we have to start ans@@ wer@@ ing .
he has a book , &quot; arab@@ ic thought in the liber@@ al age , &quot; and the liber@@ al age , he defin@@ es as 19@@ th century and early 20th century .
bu@@ zz@@ car lets people r@@ ent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors .
we know we &apos;re not always angry , always je@@ al@@ ous , always gener@@ ous .
and you &apos;d have to start a new categ@@ ory , right between cell phones and cho@@ col@@ ate .
every one of these circles is a co@@ g , a st@@ ack of co@@ gs , and this thing is as big as a ste@@ am lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive .
girl : i just take off my ci , and i don &apos;t hear anything .
a@@ g : okay , there &apos;s his fif@@ th hypo@@ thesis .
so instead , we decided to take the colum@@ n , and we decided to build it as a la@@ y@@ ered model , made out of very many sli@@ ces , thin@@ ly stac@@ ked over each other .
all right , so the bottom line is this : because of the increase in speed , and because of the vast amount of hab@@ itable real est@@ ate in the co@@ smo@@ s , i figure we &apos;re going to pick up a sign@@ al within two do@@ zen years .
well , i &apos;ll tell you -- a lot .
so , i &apos;m going to , like , go through some sli@@ des from way back when , and walk through them to give you a sense of how i end up here .
so the next time you type a cap@@ tcha , these words that you &apos;re typ@@ ing are actually words that are coming from books that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed that the computer could not recognize .
thank you .
instead , something about the organization must be changing as the col@@ ony gets older .
for 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of kill@@ ing , of se@@ ct@@ arian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civili@@ zations and art and culture for thousands of years .
he took the treatment , and on the way back , he dro@@ ve the truck by himself .
and somehow these am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds are comb@@ ined , and life begins .
and if we look at the history of law@@ ns , it &apos;s actually rather tra@@ gic .
s@@ k : absolutely . and this is something that i re@@ com@@ mend everyone in this audience to do .
in particular , about 12 years ago we created a prepar@@ ation that we named bra@@ in-@@ machine inter@@ faces .
pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey &apos;s bra@@ in@@ waves , to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey &apos;s arm did .
in my talk today , i &apos;ve told you a little bit about mind-wandering , a vari@@ able that i think turns out to be fair@@ ly important in the equ@@ ation for happiness .
and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as re@@ gar@@ ds this telescope is the mirror .
and it &apos;s a much better way to see .
but to me , &quot; ada@@ pt all the time &quot; means something deep@@ er , too .
rs : that &apos;s exactly right .
if you took the same technology and pil@@ oted it into one of those remote schools , where the score was 30 percent , and , let &apos;s say , took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .
it &apos;s the power of patient networks .
here india can look at what is happening in the west and el@@ se@@ where , and look at what needs to be done .
it &apos;s a home@@ made video , made it myself at three o &apos;@@ clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is . you never see that .
the point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adap@@ tation .
so there &apos;s points , and these points are actually being cros@@ s-@@ refer@@ enced .
but it &apos;s also about collective engagement and about the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented laborat@@ ory for obser@@ ving what makes people ti@@ ck and work and play and engage on a gr@@ and scale in games .
and i &apos;m distur@@ bed by this because i &apos;ve been op@@ en@@ ly gay now for quite some time .
they didn &apos;t want to sell pi@@ rate supp@@ lies .
wal@@ -@@ m@@ art has over 1@@ 25 million u.s. custom@@ ers .
again , another medical example here .
but a few years earlier , while still at school , he &apos;d actually cra@@ cked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .
because there &apos;s no place to put a maker outside , as there was in the ari@@ st@@ ot@@ eli@@ an and the new@@ ton@@ ian universe .
what i &apos;m going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two-@@ dig@@ it numbers faster than they can do on their cal@@ cul@@ ators , even using the shor@@ t@@ cut method .
and it &apos;s a sc@@ ary thing as well . because when we start looking at the collective appe@@ ti@@ te for our lifest@@ y@@ les , and what we &apos;re doing to that landscape -- that , to me , is something that is a very so@@ ber@@ ing moment for me to con@@ temp@@ late .
but you can see , even just intu@@ it , from this map , that the h@@ arb@@ or has dre@@ d@@ ged and fl@@ atten@@ ed , and went from a rich , three-@@ dimensional mo@@ sa@@ ic to flat mu@@ ck in really a matter of years .
he started showing the symptom@@ s about 12 years ago , and he was offici@@ ally diagno@@ sed in 200@@ 5 .
so i wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast , that would be cheap , and that would be open-@@ source , so , because oil sp@@ ills are not only happening in the gulf of mexico , and that would be using ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy .
now , one way to crack the code is to interpre@@ t these signals and figure out what they mean , but it &apos;s a difficult job , and we actually don &apos;t have a ro@@ se@@ tt@@ a stone yet .
so jordan &apos;s main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-@@ equi@@ pped lab at the university and re@@ create it in a gar@@ age in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself .
and mostly i wanted to be the fif@@ th me@@ mber of de@@ pe@@ che mode or dur@@ an dur@@ an .
i posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community .
so a high i@@ .@@ q .
we know that - 1 is a prime number .
you remember to talk all five culture st@@ ages .
back in 199@@ 2 , i started working for a company called inter@@ val research , which was just then being fo@@ unded by david li@@ d@@ ell and paul allen as a for@@ -@@ profit research enter@@ prise in silicon valley .
another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species .
people go one , two , three , four , te@@ ar .
and how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and compu@@ tation problem ?
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
and the number one present@@ ation ti@@ p : never , ever look at the screen .
we heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people .
i don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
one exception is in massa@@ ch@@ usetts .
you only tell your de@@ ar@@ est , closest friend , s@@ wor@@ n to secre@@ cy for life , the first time you had sex .
if it &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ ar , you make a sp@@ her@@ ical lens .
we need to em@@ power people to remember the com@@ passionate e@@ tho@@ s , and to give gui@@ del@@ ines . this char@@ ter would not be a massive docum@@ ent .
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensi@@ ble reform possible until we end this corruption .
some famous ones like the open university , which has 1@@ 10,000 students , the university of the third age , which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people , as well as strange things like di@@ y gar@@ ages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs .
and the &quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; was , what if we could take bra@@ d pit@@ t , and we could put bra@@ d in this device , and use this cont@@ our process , and we could sti@@ pp@@ le on this phosphor@@ es@@ cent ma@@ ke@@ up and put him under the black lights , and we could , in fact , scan him in real time per@@ forming ek@@ man &apos;s fac@@ s poses .
re@@ bec@@ ca onie : what if our healthcare system kept us healthy ?
well , because it gives them good , pa@@ ying jobs , or , in many african countries , un@@ offici@@ al opportunities to profit from corruption .
well , along comes ben@@ j@@ amin franklin , and he comes close to con@@ vul@@ sing himself with a b@@ ol@@ t of electricity off the end of his ki@@ te .
but we do know that the self-@@ organization trend throughout the universe is long , and it began with things like galaxies ; they main@@ ta@@ ined their order for billions of years .
you can do all those fun things .
how do we get those people together to contribu@@ te that work ?
i want to talk about to@@ ys , and the power that i see in@@ her@@ ent in them .
so when a passi@@ ve object like this one seems to be alive , because it is -- wo@@ o@@ sh -- starting to move .
and people who are de@@ liber@@ ating -- &quot; should i return it ?
gets it wrong , you press a butt@@ on on the sho@@ ck box .
this provi@@ des a slightly more stati@@ st@@ ical look at things .
but there &apos;s a ro@@ ad@@ block that you can &apos;t get past .
but what does it take ?
so , my message to you fol@@ ks , from my three minutes , is that i appreci@@ ate the chance to share this with you . i will be back . i love being at ted .
exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .
we &apos;re s@@ elling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
she looks nothing like mar@@ il@@ yn , but by the time we &apos;ve made her up and put wi@@ gs and ma@@ ke@@ up on , she looks exactly like mar@@ il@@ yn , to the ex@@ tent that her hus@@ band couldn &apos;t recognize her -- or recognize this loo@@ k-@@ ali@@ ke -- in these photographs , which i find quite interesting .
and , like all gras@@ ses , at a certain point it puts out seeds .
and they came down on the side of open publi@@ cation , which is the right approach -- we &apos;ve brief@@ ed the white house , we &apos;ve brief@@ ed members of con@@ gress , we &apos;ve tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advan@@ ces .
it &apos;s really amazing that all this stuff is here .
thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist manu@@ al sol@@ a-@@ mor@@ ales who was re@@ designing the wat@@ er@@ front in por@@ to , portu@@ gal .
no matter how good you are , right , you still got@@ ta deal with — so you hit this wall , and when i hit it , the first thing you do is you fall forward , and i &apos;m like , all right , all right .
why are they doing that ? because they expect invest@@ ment to follow .
it &apos;s not like its relation to some abstra@@ ct form .
you can draw ground water from any well .
&quot; moon is one with god .
for power is not just moving lat@@ er@@ ally from nation to nation .
it &apos;s oc@@ tober of 195@@ 7 , and spu@@ t@@ ni@@ k has just launched , and we &apos;re in lau@@ re@@ l mar@@ y@@ land , at the app@@ lied physics lab associated with john@@ s hopkins university .
so over the course of two se@@ me@@ sters , the fall and the spring , the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4@@ ,@@ 500 square foot studio / shop space .
and at that time , it became set in stone : the a@@ qua@@ tic theory should be du@@ mp@@ ed with the u@@ fo@@ s and the ye@@ tis , as part of the lun@@ a@@ tic fr@@ inge of science .
this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy at the m@@ all how much time would it take to inst@@ all .
we often can &apos;t think of a young woman who has heart disease .
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
and so before we could start ima@@ ging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
thank you very much .
i don &apos;t know any tedtalk that con@@ tains this .
nobody had had a gli@@ mp@@ se of the brain &apos;s wir@@ ing .
i am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
i think you guys know it quite well .
they &apos;re not prote@@ cted in ireland .
now if you think back on tin@@ a fe@@ y &apos;s im@@ person@@ ations on satur@@ day night live of the new@@ ly n@@ om@@ in@@ ated vice pres@@ identi@@ al can@@ di@@ date sar@@ ah pal@@ in , they were deva@@ stat@@ ing .
and we hypo@@ thes@@ ize based on the ti@@ ck@@ ling study that when one child h@@ its another , they generate the movement comm@@ and .
as we heard earlier , movement is very important in these kinds of living systems .
there &apos;s a lot of activity in india .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re on the left , on the right , up the middle , wher@@ ever .
it does suggest we &apos;ve still got a bit to learn .
and that led me to this project .
many of you all know about the concept of scan@@ ning for wir@@ eless networks .
&quot; no . it should be go go g@@ ad@@ get ! &quot;
so it an@@ ger@@ ed the chinese ne@@ ti@@ zens .
but in survi@@ ving this last year , i was re@@ minded of a car@@ din@@ al rule -- not a research rule , but a moral imper@@ ative from my up@@ bringing -- you &apos;ve got to dance with the one who br@@ ung ya .
here we are on oc@@ tober the 19@@ th .
the green areas are the areas we use to grow cro@@ ps , like whe@@ at or so@@ y@@ be@@ ans or cor@@ n or rice or whatever .
but deeply tu@@ cked into the fabri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there .
thank you very much .
suddenly , this appeared .
if you follow policy , you probably know that a few years ago the president ple@@ d@@ ged 15 billion dollars to fight the epide@@ mic over five years , and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replic@@ ate uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decre@@ ase the epide@@ mic .
this is my wife du@@ sty , with a mu@@ sh@@ room called f@@ om@@ it@@ op@@ sis offic@@ in@@ al@@ is -- ag@@ ari@@ k@@ on .
it &apos;s called &quot; ari@@ a . &quot;
so i started studying anth@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ y .
the reason is kur@@ dist@@ an .
and then so , one had to constantly inno@@ v@@ ate .
and so we end up with va@@ in decisions and we can &apos;t even afford our mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge .
and it goes like this .
har@@ sh@@ a b@@ ho@@ gle : the rise of cri@@ cket , the rise of india
the hy@@ en@@ a is probably the most perfectly designed sc@@ a@@ v@@ enging animal in the world .
and i said to myself , &quot; lewis , don &apos;t look left , don &apos;t look right .
you could ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct me .
and here &apos;s where the dead people start to help us out , because lots of people have studied the problem of pac@@ king circles .
so this is what nasa did , getting an eight man version that would go to mars .
every day we &apos;re conne@@ cting more and more of our lives to the internet , which means that the internet of things will soon be the internet of things to be ha@@ cked .
we call this gravit@@ ational len@@ sing .
we were once just as certain that the world was flat .
because it &apos;s published on demand and it &apos;s developed from this re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of open materials .
anyone here lucky enough to share , to co@@ hab@@ it with a mouse -- a dom@@ esti@@ c partner@@ ship with mi@@ ce ?
if we set up those same scen@@ ari@@ os in our little monkey market , would they do the same thing as people ?
it recogni@@ zes where the person is , what they &apos;re doing , fil@@ ls out the light when necess@@ ary to full spectrum white light , and sa@@ ves maybe 30 , 40 percent in energy consumption , li@@ gh@@ ting systems .
fort@@ y-@@ five years after gei@@ ger , health leads has to rein@@ v@@ ent the pres@@ cri@@ ption for basic resources .
and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river , part of the river .
now , if i compare that to a c@@ ot@@ ton to@@ we@@ l that i can use a thousand times , i don &apos;t have a whole lot of em@@ bo@@ died energy until i was@@ h that yo@@ gur@@ ty to@@ we@@ l .
and ever since , i &apos;ve been walking the my@@ stic path , trying to pe@@ er beyond what al@@ bert einstein called &quot; the op@@ tical del@@ u@@ sion of everyday consciousness . &quot;
don &apos;t over@@ do it . &quot;
and a lot of the fun@@ ctions in the data that we have as in@@ put systems here are really different than we understand them , because we &apos;re not meas@@ uring them dynam@@ ically .
how can we help improve govern@@ ance and introduce che@@ cks and bal@@ an@@ ces ?
there &apos;s a colle@@ ction of 10 countries , some call them the li@@ ons , who in the last decade have had a com@@ bin@@ ation of 100 percent de@@ bt can@@ cell@@ ation , a tri@@ pling of aid , a ten@@ fold increase in f@@ di -- that &apos;s foreign direct invest@@ ment -- which has un@@ lo@@ cked a quad@@ ru@@ pling of dom@@ esti@@ c resources -- that &apos;s local money -- which , when spent wi@@ sely -- that &apos;s good govern@@ ance -- cut childhood mortality by a third , dou@@ bled education comple@@ tion rates , and they , too , hal@@ ved extreme poverty , and at this rate , these 10 get to zero too .
even more wor@@ r@@ ying for the americans , in dec@@ em@@ ber 2008 the ho@@ li@@ est of ho@@ lies , the it systems of cent@@ com , the central comm@@ and man@@ aging the wars in iraq and afghanistan , may have been in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by hack@@ ers who used these : pla@@ in but infe@@ cted us@@ b keys .
and in my surge@@ on &apos;s 20@@ -@@ year career , he said it was among the most difficult transplan@@ ts that he &apos;s ever per@@ formed .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
it &apos;s still qui@@ cker to do that and more prac@@ tical .
and you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been as@@ le@@ ep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five v@@ ali@@ ums -- you know , they &apos;re all over the place .
if an ant fell into my rice , i couldn &apos;t see that either .
so that sets the stage on which you do this .
if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assum@@ ing that everybody car@@ es about two things on any decision .
journalist anas are@@ me@@ y@@ a@@ w anas has broken do@@ zens of stories of corruption and organi@@ zed crime all over ghana -- without ever reve@@ aling his identity . in this talk anas shows gr@@ is@@ ly foot@@ age from some of his investig@@ ations and demon@@ str@@ ates the importance of facing in@@ justi@@ ce .
you see the ne@@ ther@@ lands is kind of the biggest of the small group .
finally , not that long ago , cra@@ ig v@@ enter created the first artificial cell , where he took a cell , took a dna synthesi@@ zer , which is a machine , created an artificial genome , put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then re@@ produced as the other cell .
i mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to man@@ kind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into , a , trying to come up with alternative fu@@ els and , b , you know , we just launched this prize , which is really a prize in case we don &apos;t get an answer on alternative fu@@ els , in case we don &apos;t actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly , and in case we go through the ti@@ pping point .
if they have a hi@@ p fra@@ cture we go with them and we study their entire dis@@ charge experience .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it &apos;s not as sever@@ e .
so let &apos;s try to look at it from a different perspective .
some say we can &apos;t afford to . i say we can &apos;t afford not to .
they mer@@ ely decided to lead them .
and the u.s. military sp@@ ends 1.@@ 5 billion dollars -- billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars -- developing the nor@@ den bom@@ b@@ sight .
the first sho@@ ck hur@@ ts like hell .
so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wra@@ pping up here , because if you think about it , what i &apos;ve been talking about today is this notion -- very un@@ contro@@ versi@@ al am@@ ong@@ st econom@@ ists -- that most things are very hom@@ e-@@ bi@@ as@@ ed .
natural sele@@ ction also expla@@ ins many basic re@@ vul@@ sions , such as the hor@@ rid sm@@ ell of ro@@ tting meat , or fe@@ ars , such as the fear of sna@@ kes or standing close to the edge of a cli@@ ff .
we shouldn &apos;t be doing it from outside .
so what we &apos;re saying is that sc@@ al@@ ability should not become an enemy of sustain@@ ability .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the pen@@ is thing .
and this was gene showing the un@@ cle where atlan@@ ta was on the map , where he lived .
it &apos;s full of history , and also full of under@@ ground bun@@ kers and ru@@ ins from the war .
but , you know , there are ways out .
it &apos;s like hur@@ ry , build your instru@@ ments .
4@@ 3 percent of the children in need of an inf@@ ant feeding program to prevent mal@@ nutri@@ tion and early death are now getting the food supp@@ le@@ ments they need to stay alive and to grow .
we &apos;re pretty sure that the only people who don &apos;t experience sha@@ me are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy .
we used to think this was a uni@@ qu@@ ely human ability , but we learned that the great ap@@ es , our closest rela@@ tives , also show this ability .
i once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money , something that i did a lot .
let &apos;s sit down and really tell you where the money should be chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed and where this aid should go . &quot;
robots and algorithms are getting good at jobs like building cars , writing artic@@ les , transl@@ ating -- jobs that once requi@@ red a human . so what will we humans do for work ? andrew mc@@ af@@ ee wal@@ ks through recent labor data to say : we a@@ in &apos;t seen nothing yet . but then he ste@@ ps back to look at big history , and comes up with a surprising and even th@@ ri@@ ll@@ ing view of what comes next .
it gets way better .
you can work for a small company , in a boring bran@@ ch .
i asked him whether , consi@@ dering the sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ces he had to make , he ever had any re@@ gre@@ ts .
green .
now the self that experi@@ ences directly can only exist in the moment , but the one that nar@@ rates needs several moments , a whole sequence of them , and that &apos;s why our full sense of self needs both immer@@ sive experience and the flow of time .
and i think i &apos;ve found a few .
and i don &apos;t even have any help . &quot;
but that ability to make progress rema@@ ined almost un@@ used , until the event that revolution@@ i@@ zed the human condition and changed the universe .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the op@@ posite direction , came over into my lan@@ e , ran over the top of my car and his ax@@ le tor@@ e my arm off .
how do i know which r@@ hin@@ o@@ virus i have ?
well , there &apos;s some fantastic examples here to scale up , mostly pil@@ oted within africa , actually .
and with these pictures , i hope that we can create information , a system of information .
there is a sort of mis@@ con@@ ception no@@ wadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adv@@ enture .
this sort of behavior has been going on for three , four , five million years , and we can &apos;t step in and say , &quot; that &apos;s wrong , and that &apos;s right . &quot;
now some people might say email is really distra@@ cting and i@@ .@@ m@@ . is really distra@@ cting , and these other things are really distra@@ cting , but they &apos;re distra@@ cting at a time of your own choice and your own cho@@ o@@ sing .
so i believe this kept me running .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
it was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat .
that &apos;s pretty cool .
an am@@ ar@@ y@@ lli@@ s flo@@ wer looking really three-@@ dimensional .
and i re@@ co@@ iled . they st@@ ank !
it would have the inter@@ discipl@@ in@@ arity of the ted conference .
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience , which will create the new world .
vol@@ can@@ oes er@@ up@@ t .
and then finally , you &apos;re asking for my money , not just because it &apos;s my money , but because it &apos;s me .
chinese had pione@@ ered technologies like steel , printing , g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der .
and we &apos;ve got to get them all right , because if we solve 11 , we fa@@ il to solve the 12@@ th -- we &apos;re in trouble . for example , if we solve our problems of water and soil and population , but don &apos;t solve our problems of tox@@ ics , then we are in trouble .
look at all this stuff that &apos;s here for our cam@@ p@@ fire .
one of the things which my inter@@ n here , pr@@ at@@ es@@ h , built is a mobile app@@ lication , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .
it was amazing to see . and it &apos;s a beautiful game .
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
now i realize for those of you who are color@@ blind , this slide is not very hel@@ p@@ ful , but stick with me nonetheless .
we pose a threat to the order of the government .
on one vancou@@ ver morning , we went out on the campus at university of british columbia and we appro@@ ached people and said , &quot; do you want to be in an experiment ? &quot;
and the answer is : i got them from fli@@ ck@@ r .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
i come back up , not for air .
so when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff whenever they want .
so what you &apos;re sm@@ elling is several hundred molecules flo@@ ating through the air , hit@@ ting your no@@ se .
because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we &apos;re going to treat the environment .
and the men were all gre@@ cian war@@ ri@@ ors fighting with ag@@ am@@ em@@ n@@ on .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa to find these robust self-@@ organi@@ zing algorithms .
they actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like lo@@ w-@@ th@@ res@@ hold peri@@ pher@@ al activi@@ ties that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bon@@ ding social capital that we &apos;re l@@ ac@@ king . and very , very quickly -- i love pu@@ ppe@@ ts . here &apos;s a pu@@ p@@ pet .
and in fact you can program the self-@@ assem@@ bly of things , so he starts cho@@ col@@ at@@ e-@@ di@@ pping ed@@ ges , changing the hy@@ d@@ rop@@ ho@@ bi@@ city and the hydro@@ phy@@ li@@ city .
those re@@ ef@@ s at discovery bay , ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a were the most studied coral re@@ ef@@ s in the world for 20 years .
you almost never hear someone say the office .
n@@ g : those are for you .
these be@@ ars are already showing sig@@ ns of the stress of disappe@@ aring ice .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a poten@@ tially contro@@ versi@@ al statement .
good .
no , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos , right ?
ev@@ an willi@@ ams : the voices of twitter us@@ ers
and thir@@ dly , how does life make things disappe@@ ar into systems ?
what we are interested in is information .
you &apos;ve got black smo@@ kers going all over the place and ch@@ im@@ ne@@ ys that have tube wor@@ ms that might be eight to 10 feet long .
you &apos;ve got to extra@@ ct gener@@ ali@@ zations so you can produce and understand new sent@@ ences .
and we tag@@ ged them very simply , not very hi@@ -@@ tech , with a big , long pole .
and i still believe real leaders are like that .
how many of you are completely comfortable with call@@ ing y@@ ourselves a leader ?
it matters a great deal .
it &apos;s actually already used by the military a little bit , but it &apos;s the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you &apos;re re@@ moved from it physi@@ cally .
sometimes they look like our spo@@ uses , but they are not your parents or spo@@ uses .
wet@@ lands glob@@ ally are one of the most en@@ danger@@ ed eco@@ systems .
we used to bo@@ ast about fast social progress .
and so therefore , because time is short , if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . it &apos;s very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
we can never seem to gras@@ p it in its tot@@ ality .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible a@@ we for us .
chri@@ sti@@ en mein@@ der@@ ts@@ ma , auth@@ or of &quot; pig 0@@ 50@@ 49 &quot; looks at the aston@@ ishing after@@ life of the ordinary pig , parts of which make their way into at least 18@@ 5 non-@@ por@@ k products , from bul@@ lets to artificial he@@ arts .
now , by the time we get out here to , let &apos;s say , ac@@ ute bee paraly@@ sis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you &apos;re a bee --- this virus shares almost no simil@@ arity to co@@ x@@ sa@@ ck@@ ie@@ virus , but i can guaran@@ tee you that the sequences that are most conser@@ ved among these viruses on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand of the screen are in identical regi@@ ons right up here .
as i said , it &apos;s emp@@ ty ; it &apos;s cold ; and it &apos;s dark out there . or is it ?
and the government research bu@@ re@@ au brought represent@@ a@@ tives together and told them that this is something that has to be done .
and i couldn &apos;t choose air@@ planes because they had gotten sort of un@@ roman@@ tic at that point , even though i &apos;d done a lot of airplane work , on the inter@@ i@@ ors .
and that &apos;s because we tend to think of skelet@@ ons as sti@@ ff le@@ ver systems that produce speed or power .
right after september 1@@ 1@@ th , last year , i was thinking about pain and the way that we dis@@ per@@ se it , the way that we exc@@ ise it from our bodies .
i mean , i was a beautiful baby .
or we can monit@@ or the vel@@ o@@ city with which people are moving with their phones on a highway , and the phone company can see , as the vel@@ o@@ city is slo@@ wing down , that there &apos;s a traffic ja@@ m .
and we st@@ ole recently a ship from the united states na@@ vy .
there &apos;s no ice over it .
central manhattan became possible .
most of us are familiar with electr@@ ons .
you &apos;re not totally in control , but you &apos;re changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democra@@ tic spread of voices .
the new thing is that we have the biggest pi@@ le of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging econom@@ ies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-@@ edu@@ cated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; ri@@ cher also &#93; have .
this is just simply asking , again , as if we had arri@@ ved for the first time , what is the relationship of the human project to time and space ?
one of them was the remarkable gh@@ ari@@ al .
g@@ d@@ p has been our ha@@ mmer .
terrible na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , is that one .
thank you very much .
cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are small cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans .
but they are really acting mostly as condu@@ its .
is just an art@@ ful demonstration of de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity .
he said , &quot; my job is to prove dr. ste@@ wart wrong . &quot;
did the images change the world ?
early on , i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but i realized that wasn &apos;t the way to go .
we think in abstra@@ ct terms , we think in movement .
so i called the human@@ e society and i say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
thank you .
even fi@@ del ca@@ str@@ o now says that the only thing worse than being explo@@ ited by mul@@ tin@@ ational cap@@ ital@@ ism is not being explo@@ ited by mul@@ tin@@ ational cap@@ ital@@ ism .
patients ad@@ mitted to a hospital that was destro@@ yed during the genoci@@ de that we have ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated along with four other clinics , complete with solar power gener@@ ators , good lab technology .
ok , i call the sp@@ ca to con@@ fir@@ m this -- they con@@ fir@@ m it .
why is this ? i used medical college girls .
so we came up with a different proto@@ cell model , and this is actually sim@@ pl@@ er than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
so weib@@ o , the 300 million public sphere , became a very good , convenient tool for a political fight .
then i understood this -- adap@@ ting that un@@ hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic method to manage her period days .
well , if we &apos;re talking about the old days of an all@@ -@@ out nuclear attack , you , up here , are as dead as the people here . so it was a mo@@ ot point .
but the one thing that has made a big com@@ e@@ back just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .
we knew that , when mon@@ ol@@ ingu@@ als were tested in ta@@ i@@ pe@@ i and seattle on the m@@ and@@ ar@@ in sounds , they showed the same pattern .
so , this is exactly what i did .
it &apos;s seven c@@ ents a minute , in many cases .
you spend more time with your parents .
hon@@ ey@@ bee robo@@ tics designed the mars dri@@ ll@@ er , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
seven zero .
then there &apos;s the li@@ ger .
so after seeing these sho@@ cking statistics , i thought to myself , &quot; okay , even if i &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that i don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , i at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot;
i think that failure can be an incredibly motiv@@ ating force as well , so i moved to ken@@ ya and worked in uganda , and i met a group of r@@ wand@@ an women , who asked me , in 198@@ 6 , to move to k@@ ig@@ al@@ i to help them start the first micro@@ finance instit@@ ution there .
see , you have a mental model .
t@@ k : that &apos;s c@@ lau@@ dia , and that was the first time she got to feel sen@@ sation through her pro@@ s@@ thetic .
what &apos;s important is that they be about the same .
most of what we do is sub@@ conscious .
we are living on a planet with a lot of activi@@ ties , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
i have occasi@@ onal meetings with scientists .
they &apos;re not a big deal for us .
we &apos;ve up@@ gra@@ ded time and again and again .
rb : no , i think if you &apos;re bringing up kids , you just want to s@@ mother them with love and pra@@ ise and enthusias@@ m .
let us celebrate diversity .
so you can see in a system like this there was enormous sub@@ tle potential of represent@@ ing human emotions .
it re@@ tains its c@@ res@@ cent shape and moves in the direction of the hor@@ ns .
so thanks very much .
and what you find is that the car se@@ ats and the lap@@ -@@ and-@@ shoul@@ der bel@@ ts , when it comes to saving lives , fat@@ alities look exactly identical .
so what &apos;s significant about this isn &apos;t that cro@@ ws are using cars to crack nuts .
i could see vi@@ vi@@ dly , i sup@@ pose , being fil@@ med out of the door of a he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background , and i had a ski pole with a union jack , you know , flying in the wind .
it can be expensive , not fe@@ asi@@ ble , un@@ eth@@ ical , or , fran@@ k@@ ly , just not possible to do such a thing .
well that &apos;s something we &apos;re starting to work on very hard .
in that we &apos;re unique , and each of us holds this critical in@@ put into production as we hold this machine .
isra@@ el@@ i a non@@ violent prot@@ est is not going to stop the &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
we are totally closed .
i know many religi@@ ons are so an@@ xi@@ ous about pres@@ er@@ ving the pu@@ ri@@ ty of their faith among their children that they are in@@ tent on keeping their children ignor@@ ant of other fa@@ i@@ ths .
and it &apos;s very interesting to see that the hig@@ he@@ st-@@ ran@@ king american city , hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , number 2@@ 8 , is followed by kind of the usual suspe@@ cts of seattle and boston and all wal@@ k@@ able cities .
wo@@ ol sticks on vel@@ cr@@ o .
are you ready to make the match ?
and i moved to red@@ lands california .
they see an example , at least , to take some inspiration from .
scot@@ t fr@@ aser : why e@@ ye@@ wit@@ n@@ esses get it wrong
we were ban@@ ned from egyp@@ t , and our cor@@ respon@@ dents , some of them were ar@@ re@@ sted .
what can we do ? it &apos;s not so easy .
non@@ sense . you can &apos;t have it all . you can &apos;t .
you work on the front lines . and you &apos;ve seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another .
i &apos;m about to sna@@ p like a bri@@ ttle twi@@ g , when suddenly someone ta@@ ps me on the shoul@@ der .
back on highway 1 , i en@@ vision@@ ed what a@@ wa@@ ited .
and i started working harder , faster .
so if you &apos;re running nam@@ i@@ bia for coca-cola , and you have a 10@@ 7 const@@ itu@@ en@@ cies , you know where every can versus bottle of spri@@ te , fan@@ ta or co@@ ke was sold , whether it was a corner store , a super@@ market or a pus@@ h@@ c@@ art .
last slide .
this is a new chair which should come on the market in september .
our at@@ titude is , &quot; well , look , if you can get the advertising don@@ ated , you know , at four o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , i &apos;m okay with that .
so this is happening in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
but this technology is very new , but techni@@ cally is very old .
the &quot; graph &apos;@@ g-@@ be@@ am turn on . &quot; this next slide , that &apos;s the -- as far as i know -- the first digital bit@@ map display , 195@@ 4 .
that &apos;s why , two years ago , i created the cy@@ bor@@ g foundation , which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cy@@ bor@@ g , tries to encourage people to ex@@ tend their senses by using technology as part of the body .
so i just recently dro@@ pped out of prin@@ c@@ et@@ on and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
i interview and do portraits .
dh : how about if i try first and then decide ?
so why are people willing to adjust with that mis@@ match ?
but na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in told me , &quot; listen now , we &apos;re here . &quot;
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expan@@ sion of human intelligence through this direct mer@@ ger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
the contr@@ ast in liter@@ acy rates is especially shar@@ p between chinese women and indian women .
there would be no@@ where to turn .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
so i set up a scientific cri@@ teria as to what a sens@@ or would have to look like in order to effectively diagno@@ se pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer .
but it turns out , it doesn &apos;t re@@ mind me of the thing i thought it would ; it re@@ minds me constantly of something else instead .
and so the collective effect of all of that has been this marg@@ in@@ alization of lots and lots of jobs .
but i also like to think a lot about argu@@ ing .
and there are two con@@ sequences of this .
and it &apos;s pretty incredible because i took my iphone there , and he was like , &quot; yeah , do you want an up@@ grade ? &quot;
and my grand@@ father would call me every week , and he would say , &quot; j@@ ar@@ re@@ tt , how &apos;s it going ? do you have a job yet ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t find it as hu@@ mor@@ ous as i did , anyway .
a recent study at pen@@ n state university found that when you s@@ mile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more lik@@ able and cour@@ te@@ ous , but you actually appear to be more compe@@ tent .
perhaps anger .
his name was ni@@ kol@@ a , ni@@ kol@@ a tesla .
in other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neur@@ on in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fir@@ es .
and i &apos;m going to name one more revolution , and this is the revolution in brain sci@@ ences , which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions .
and i remembered -- i used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing bo@@ ats -- i remember fis@@ her@@ men telling me they can always tell when a bas@@ king shark &apos;s been cau@@ ght in the net because it leaves this black sli@@ me behind .
because it &apos;s so hard to ad@@ mit our own fal@@ li@@ bility .
do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but i can have four of these on my finger , so you would not to be able to really see them .
we divided the patients into two groups .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
so , bo@@ b dylan , like all fol@@ k sing@@ ers , he cop@@ i@@ ed melo@@ dies , he trans@@ formed them , he comb@@ ined them with new lyri@@ cs which were frequ@@ ently their own con@@ co@@ ction of pre@@ vi@@ ous stuff .
at ted@@ global 2010 , auth@@ or ma@@ tt rid@@ ley shows how , throughout history , the engine of human progress has been the meeting and ma@@ ting of ideas to make new ideas . it &apos;s not important how clever individuals are , he says ; what really matters is how smart the collective brain is .
it makes a lot of mistakes .
if i make the fla@@ ps s@@ kin@@ ni@@ er , i can use a bit less paper .
okay , so that &apos;s in &apos; 9@@ 6 . here &apos;s in 2010 .
homo ere@@ ctu@@ s made the same tool for 3@@ 0,000 generations .
so my k@@ night in sh@@ ining ar@@ mor , john ma@@ eda , without any pro@@ mp@@ t , came out with this big dec@@ lar@@ ation on why video games bel@@ ong in the mom@@ a .
everyone was very excited about this arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assem@@ ble a single do@@ do skelet@@ on .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves o@@ be@@ y him . &quot;
by young students from stand@@ ford university on an extreme aff@@ or@@ dab@@ ili@@ ty project that they had , basically .
so you move around the content on a display , but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contra@@ cts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty meet@@ ing-@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bie back home .
with stre@@ ams and ri@@ vers dr@@ ying up because of over@@ -@@ u@@ sage , ro@@ b har@@ mon has imple@@ mented an in@@ gen@@ ious market mechan@@ ism to bring back the water . farmers and be@@ er companies find their f@@ ates inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed in the in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old tale of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but what else could i offer her ?
the core institutions that were put in place in 199@@ 8 and their modi@@ fi@@ cations in 200@@ 6 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict par@@ ties to see their core concern@@ s and dem@@ ands addres@@ sed .
they started as just sort of a transport organization that speci@@ alized in s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ing between the u.s .
and when i see all these h@@ ex@@ ag@@ ons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migra@@ ine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like ca@@ ve art or or@@ nam@@ ent@@ al art may have been der@@ i@@ ved from them a bit .
and it works -- look at these head@@ lines .
i mean it is aston@@ ishing for an artist , for an architect , to become actually an ic@@ on and a le@@ gend in their own time .
yeah , i do this . i know where it is , because i pe@@ e@@ ked before and then i do this .
so first , we demo@@ lish it .
john sear@@ le : our shared condition -- consciousness
well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
and , in fact , the equ@@ ations that make neurons into electrical gener@@ ators were discovered by two cambridge no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates .
and you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe , which is , of course , the universe itself .
and two weeks after this drawing was done , we actually had our first project contra@@ ct , at a@@ ero@@ viron@@ ment , on robotic co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ches , which was very fri@@ ghten@@ ing to me .
now , what happens is , when you ou@@ ts@@ our@@ ce the bottom r@@ ung of the la@@ d@@ der to india for innovation and for r &amp; amp ; d work , at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to con@@ front a problem , which is where does the next step of the la@@ d@@ der people come from within your company ?
even building co@@ des actually limit the ability for us to build much t@@ aller than four stories in many places , and that &apos;s true here in the united states .
t@@ ani@@ y@@ ama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
he showed how all of this can be put together .
i did quite a lot of research .
and here &apos;s the building as it opened , with a chan@@ ne@@ l over@@ looking down@@ town , and as seen from down@@ town .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
and it led us to the project , the cour@@ thou@@ se , which is absolutely a part of a negoti@@ ation between tradition and pieces of the traditional cour@@ thou@@ se .
so they get im@@ mun@@ e to sounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
if the connection is weak , the mot@@ ors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course .
it &apos;s letting stuff happen without thinking about it .
usually they sound aw@@ ful . aw@@ ful indeed .
people find these to be more mor@@ ally ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ent if they &apos;ve been re@@ minded to was@@ h their hands .
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so swe@@ et .
all throughout the developing world , people are going directly to cell phones , ski@@ pping the whole land@@ line stage .
our bodies are home to trilli@@ ons of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
so what have we learned ?
but we also start out as a@@ qua@@ tic organisms .
so , i &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really sei@@ ze this as an opportunity to get this into our medical recor@@ ds .
all these schools in texas compe@@ te with one another to achieve these mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones , and there are bon@@ uses and various other tre@@ ats that come if you beat the other schools .
and nature is part of the gener@@ ator , the dri@@ ver for this building .
this will be online in several days , probably next tu@@ es@@ day .
and all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative .
well when the da@@ f-@@ 2 re@@ cep@@ tor is active , then it tri@@ g@@ gers a series of events that prevent fo@@ x@@ o from getting into the nucleus where the dna is .
i will ful@@ fill the wish .
and within a week i had come to believe that the second coming of chr@@ ist had occur@@ red , that it was sun my@@ ung moon , and that i had been speci@@ ally cho@@ sen and prepared by god to be his disci@@ ple .
they don &apos;t get any information , they don &apos;t get any value for what they spend .
she sc@@ ared us with the la@@ va man is coming , then the tsunami is coming , but then finally there were flo@@ wers and trees , and it was very beautiful .
you &apos;ve got maybe 10 seconds -- between 10 and 30 seconds , depen@@ ding on how long the pit@@ ch is -- to get their attention .
and what he did was he wrote down on the board &quot; $ 8@@ 5,000 , &quot; and he said , &quot; that &apos;s her sal@@ ary , &quot; and then he wrote down &quot; $ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
and we c@@ oll@@ u@@ de . we design tests , or at least in britain , so that people pass them . right ?
that iran was once a se@@ cul@@ ar society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
thank you .
we have to convince our audience that what we &apos;re talking about matters .
didn &apos;t get much se@@ xi@@ er than the sp@@ ence at university , let me tell you .
but we have other advan@@ tages from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
you know ? and she gave the best com@@ ment ever , and people turned around and they were like , oh my god , i didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there , you know ?
a distingu@@ ished no@@ se , with no@@ stri@@ ls lin@@ ed to fil@@ ter out sand and du@@ st , and a gro@@ o@@ ve that cat@@ ches mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure .
the dun@@ es here move sou@@ th@@ ward at a p@@ ace of around 600 meters a year .
it &apos;s a free swi@@ mm@@ ing shark with a satellite tag jump@@ ing after sal@@ mon , sen@@ ding home its data .
we make it come alive with equ@@ ations , a lot of mathematics .
they could define the vie@@ wing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual ima@@ gery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this we@@ dding , for example .
and in the mr@@ i and m@@ r spec@@ tro@@ scop@@ y here , the pro@@ state tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it di@@ min@@ ishing after a year .
in western europe , in many parts of asia , in north america , in australi@@ a , wh@@ it@@ e-@@ c@@ oll@@ ar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work .
and the blue former developing countries are mix@@ ing up with the former industri@@ alized western world .
they &apos;re not very well designed , right ?
this is from the cap@@ e last year .
the sun@@ light in jupiter , on the satelli@@ tes of jupiter , is 25 times fa@@ in@@ ter than it is here , since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as au@@ g@@ mented by these sorts of technologies .
and the question is , who would go all the way to 450 vol@@ ts ?
but the new story about oil is the government doesn &apos;t have to force us to do pain@@ ful things to get off oil -- not just incre@@ ment@@ ally , but completely -- quite the contr@@ ary . the united states , for example , can completely elimin@@ ate its use of oil and re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate the economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it &apos;s so much che@@ ap@@ er to save and sub@@ stit@@ ute for the oil than to keep on buying it .
so we actually have some movement forward .
we got@@ ta do better than that !
i should point out at this time -- i &apos;m not a sculp@@ tor ; i &apos;m a har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged model maker .
now talking about e.@@ t@@ . putting us there , or some other life , just pus@@ hes the problem further on .
&quot; do you learn to corre@@ ct your mistakes ? &quot;
he was a philosop@@ her ; he was a drum player ; he was a teacher p@@ ar excell@@ ence .
now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
i came here to speak about ec@@ ology , and i em@@ it@@ ted as much co2 as a fren@@ ch@@ man in one year .
more than cars or the internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tu@@ sh .
double click the word . watch 200 . i go double click .
we had some of them this morning .
and the other one was the chance , a pri@@ or@@ i , that the person had the disease or not .
what &apos;s a word made of ?
so , this is the challenge for this bread .
so , you can find through your je@@ ep , a cam@@ el , and a c@@ art .
how many of you are single ? any single people out there ?
ok , we &apos;ve discovered the particles , but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know , why it &apos;s built the way it is -- really you &apos;ve done stamp colle@@ cting . you haven &apos;t done science .
how do you build a better health care system ?
fri@@ gor@@ is ? this is the moon . people could live there one day .
thank you very much .
and so i went home , and i made a prototyp@@ e of this hat .
in the past , before air condi@@ tioning , we had th@@ ick walls .
and , if even all of the planet@@ ary systems in our galaxy were de@@ vo@@ id of life , there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there , al@@ together 10 ^ 2@@ 2 stars .
problems become puzz@@ les and ob@@ stac@@ les disappe@@ ar .
even , i think , we copy our way to re@@ produce , you know what i mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
so every time you see a con@@ crete jung@@ le like that , what you &apos;ve got to do is find open spac@@ es .
you know , we f@@ ought hard to get at least a small pakistan@@ i cont@@ ing@@ ent to come .
think about the place that artists can play in that -- that is the kind of in@@ cu@@ b@@ ation and adv@@ oc@@ acy that i work towards , in working with young , black artists .
h@@ mm . not .
we have no idea what they do .
you can see colle@@ ctions and con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions of large and small cells in clu@@ sters and various places .
if necess@@ ary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
and all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom .
m@@ o : my bo@@ y@@ sc@@ out tro@@ op would like to re@@ build 12 ma@@ il@@ boxes .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the adv@@ ent of the industrial revolution .
i remember what you said to me .
the notion of eff@@ ic@@ acy basically bo@@ ils down to one -- that if somebody believ@@ es that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation .
he &apos;s about five-@@ foot three and a half on a good day , standing fully up@@ right in co@@ w@@ boy boots .
he wanted me to use words like poly@@ vin@@ y@@ l ch@@ l@@ ori@@ de , which doesn &apos;t really work in voice ballo@@ ons very well .
he got 100 percent in all the important things , like nur@@ ser@@ y rhy@@ mes , for example there .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
we pu@@ mp the flu@@ id through one of these systems , and we press the butt@@ on , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the genom@@ ic character .
so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone .
but some of these photographs are beautiful , and we wonder@@ ed , was it difficult for jo@@ el me@@ y@@ ero@@ witz to make such beauty out of such deva@@ station ?
he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect , the way of life they needed to nur@@ ture .
it &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
it &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
i was in shanghai recently , and i listen@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in china , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as japan did .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
now i disc@@ us@@ sed this with professor simon bar@@ on-@@ co@@ hen who &apos;s the professor of develop@@ mental psychop@@ ath@@ ology at cambridge .
we were looking forward to re@@ building it , but eight months after we moved in , i suff@@ ered a stro@@ ke@@ -@@ like attack caused by a birth de@@ fe@@ ct .
and i always wonder@@ ed what happened under that web .
so going back to 198@@ 9 , i wrote a mem@@ o suggest@@ ing the global hyper@@ text system .
and they opened many new do@@ ors for millions of female doctors and nur@@ ses and artists and auth@@ ors , all of wh@@ om have followed them .
we asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on .
there are many health issues as well .
our good friend chris has about a six percent -- but with a bul@@ let , i might add .
so this is a cat@@ astrop@@ he .
what we find is that the data says that the number of forward c@@ it@@ ations of a patent fil@@ ed out of a u.s. r &amp; amp ; d sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary is identical to the number of forward c@@ it@@ ations of a patent fil@@ ed by an indian sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary of the same company within that company .
and there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station .

&quot; i feel good . &quot;
and he had a big j@@ ar full of plac@@ e@@ b@@ o p@@ ills that he would give them , and he &apos;d say , &quot; come back in a week , if you still feel l@@ ous@@ y . &quot;
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out .
the world &apos;s largest and most deva@@ stat@@ ing environmental and industrial project is situ@@ ated in the heart of the largest and most in@@ t@@ act forest in the world , canada &apos;s bor@@ e@@ al forest .
and every single day since then , 1,@@ 100 americans have died .
what under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed this sha@@ me , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blank enough . i &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , pro@@ mot@@ ed enough . &quot;
so in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ and@@ ing .
and she cros@@ sed in mar@@ ch , and there &apos;s a lot of snow at 18@@ ,@@ 500 feet in mar@@ ch .
i &apos;m now going to ask you to do the task , but now with a little more challenging task . there are going to be three of them that are blue . don &apos;t move your eyes .
he knew that dar@@ k@@ ly p@@ ig@@ mented peop@@ les were found close to the equ@@ ator ; li@@ ghtly p@@ ig@@ mented peop@@ les , like himself , were found closer to the po@@ les .
south africa is playing a role .
thank you .
this is one that isn &apos;t a game yet , but really should be .
and , appro@@ aching a building from a distance , you don &apos;t see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arri@@ ve at a nice little com@@ position that might re@@ mind you of a mon@@ dri@@ an or a di@@ eben@@ kor@@ n or something .
this is the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
i went there without knowing him . he was 35 . i was 2@@ 3 .
that &apos;s what he was doing , pro@@ pping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
so you think about loy@@ al@@ ty .
on the left is water coming through the sh@@ ore , taken from a nasa satellite .
but it brings me back .
here it is in relation to that same measure of in@@ equality .
you know what you &apos;re going to say ?
in about four months of rele@@ ase , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquit@@ os — in most cases we &apos;re de@@ aling with villa@@ ges here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
this was the first show that allowed vie@@ wers to say , &quot; my god , i can com@@ ment on how i feel about the viet@@ na@@ m war , about the pres@@ iden@@ cy , through television ? &quot;
what i &apos;ve been talking to you about so far is mental dis@@ or@@ ders , diseases of the mind .
when you put it in pla@@ in english , you almost force the instit@@ ution to give the people a way , a de@@ fau@@ lt out of that , and not put themselves at risk .
unless you &apos;re like me and you leave the hand@@ le in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy .
fal@@ se .
it &apos;s so weird how life just goes on .
every other animal is stronger than we are -- they have fan@@ gs , they have cla@@ ws , they have nim@@ bl@@ eness , they have speed .
the most dra@@ matic changes will be the sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per type of new py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds that will take place in china and in many other countries .
religi@@ ous icon@@ ograph@@ y .
it says a lot about the culture that &apos;s forming on campus .
but one has to wonder , now that we &apos;ve had this financial se@@ ctor collap@@ se upon us in ic@@ eland -- and by the way , europe looks pretty bad right now , and many would say that you in america are head@@ ing for some more trouble as well .
the mirror allows that , but the mirror is not ta@@ in@@ ted , is not modi@@ fied , is not alter@@ ed by those images .
yes , sun@@ light is the major alter@@ able risk factor for skin cancer , but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer .
here &apos;s another example from technology : agriculture . we think there &apos;s a food problem , so we create new seeds .
and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s from the guys and the co@@ a@@ ches and the da@@ ds , because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else . &quot;
i worked at phili@@ ps electron@@ ics in the far@@ -@@ future design research lab , looking 20 years into the future .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
if the cri@@ tic was among the op@@ tically activ@@ ated cells , the result of this inter@@ vention should be a change in policy .
on our shel@@ ves at home , we have a box set of the dv@@ d series &quot; 24 , &quot; season six to be prec@@ ise .
and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . they will provide the fun@@ ds .
i hadn &apos;t de@@ alt with this kind of problem or fran@@ k@@ ly , this whole seg@@ ment of the medical world .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mou@@ th -- that impossible connection .
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
and business creates them when it &apos;s able to meet a need at a profit .
who would have thought ? oh my go@@ sh .
people are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
and this inspired in my mind a shift from transplan@@ ting whole organs to perhaps transplan@@ ting cells .
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
it continued to evol@@ ve and oper@@ ated in one form or another on more and more sophi@@ st@@ icated computers , until only five years ago .
now , they are very efficient , but they are also very innovative .
here &apos;s a real simple example .
most are ne@@ oc@@ las@@ si@@ cal , hea@@ vy and op@@ a@@ que , made of stone or con@@ crete .
how interesting .
there it is : the strong form of the sho@@ e k@@ not .
but here &apos;s the bad news .
the seven yellow ti@@ les on the right are also gra@@ y .
then comes my favorite part of the question .
this is the picture taken at eight kilome@@ ters , ok ? again , the shor@@ eline .
for 11 years , i was ma@@ yo@@ r of ti@@ ran@@ a , our capital .
it &apos;s actually the most used fe@@ ature on the website .
if you &apos;re a smart re@@ tail@@ er , then , you will put a very expensive it@@ em that nobody will ever buy on the shel@@ f , because suddenly the $ 3@@ 3 wine doesn &apos;t look as expensive in compar@@ ison .
here in los angeles , in the bay area in san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co , it became ta@@ x de@@ du@@ cti@@ ble in the united states .
we went to a movie , we left early , and then went back to her room for ... &quot; only ca@@ ke -- just a piece of ca@@ ke .
we tried it out , first in lu@@ ton -- famous for its air@@ port and not much else , i fear -- and in bl@@ ack@@ pool -- famous for its be@@ a@@ ches and lei@@ sure .
did i ever say they were art ? i was talking about interaction design . ex@@ cu@@ se me .
they are on the money side all the time .
do you know about this ?
it &apos;s not about the shapes , it &apos;s how the shapes refle@@ ct light .
the pur@@ pose of influ@@ ence is not to build your ego , or your net worth .
and this was even more important . in fact , cam@@ p@@ bell &apos;s soup is where howard made his re@@ pu@@ tation .
i mean , we need a whole conference just de@@ v@@ oted to telling the good stories about the continent .
in one day , 18@@ ,000 times , she had to do this win@@ ding to generate two s@@ are@@ es .
so , the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
i will not run , but it &apos;s very important for me who is going to succeed me .
but they &apos;ll also go inside our brain , interact with our biological neurons .
and the gra@@ y dots are sites that are also tracking me , but i have no idea who they are .
frei ot@@ to was starting to use fo@@ am bubble diagra@@ ms and fo@@ am bubble models to generate his mann@@ heim conc@@ ert hall .
we &apos;re the only ones with je@@ wel@@ ry and democracy .
now , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to re@@ view those two scen@@ es .
so one of the things is that it really takes over .
that &apos;s what it would really mean to be con@@ servative .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mi@@ mi@@ cry and cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage .
today , al@@ ams -- as we call him for short -- is in ja@@ il .
it was made out of res@@ in , which wasn &apos;t a common material for movie pro@@ ps about the time the movie was made .
it feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment , from the over@@ lo@@ ad and the sat@@ u@@ ration to the break@@ down of trust and reli@@ ability and run@@ away s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ ism and lack of transpar@@ ency , or even just interest@@ ing@@ ness .
it &apos;s sha@@ ping a new way of being .
but as virtual and real world experi@@ ences increasingly over@@ la@@ p there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do .
third rule is that when i get back that information it &apos;s not just got somebody &apos;s hei@@ ght and weight and when they were born , it &apos;s got relationships .
but the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 2@@ 6@@ -@@ ep@@ is@@ o@@ de anima@@ ted series , which is done for global au@@ dien@@ ces : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the u.s. and tur@@ key , we know .
we come up with another idea .
i love doing this work , because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn &apos;t have before , and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet , but that happiness is not -- we &apos;re talking about the pur@@ suit of happiness , but when you really look at all the spiritual tradi@@ tions , what al@@ dous hu@@ x@@ ley called the &quot; per@@ en@@ ni@@ al wisdom , &quot; when you get past the named and forms and ritu@@ als that really divi@@ de people , it &apos;s really about -- our nature is to be happy ; our nature is to be peac@@ eful , our nature is to be healthy .
you could do the same with a space spray .
so , one after@@ no@@ on , she &apos;d heard about the safe house , jac@@ l@@ yn left her father &apos;s house and she walked for two days , two days through ma@@ sa@@ i land .
it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er for that person to don@@ ate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger char@@ ity , save 50,000 dollars on their ta@@ xes , so still be rough@@ ly 2@@ 7@@ 0,000 dollars a year ahead of the game , now be called a phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ ist because they don@@ ated 100,000 dollars to char@@ ity , probably sit on the board of the hunger char@@ ity , indeed , probably super@@ vis@@ e the poor so@@ b who decided to become the ce@@ o of the hunger char@@ ity , and have a life@@ time of this kind of power and influ@@ ence and popular pra@@ ise still ahead of them .
and in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
i was a failure .
&quot; &#91; im@@ it@@ ating arab@@ ic &#93; -- rain@@ bo@@ w ! &quot;
through the nu@@ mer@@ ous ways that we can apply cy@@ ma@@ tics , we can actually start to un@@ v@@ eil the sub@@ stance of things not seen .
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
it &apos;s like the air .
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
beauty pa@@ ge@@ ant .
well , he asked me if i could find some technological way to un@@ fold a five-@@ cent@@ u@@ ries@@ -@@ old myster@@ y related to a lost ma@@ ster@@ piece by leon@@ ardo da vin@@ ci , the &quot; battle of ang@@ hi@@ ar@@ i , &quot; which is supposed to be located in the hall of the 500 in pal@@ a@@ zz@@ o ve@@ c@@ chi@@ o , in fl@@ or@@ ence .
well , that &apos;s a whole other le@@ cture .
and our little life is ro@@ unded with a sleep .
and four@@ th and most important , the mammo@@ graphy debate will rage on , but i do believe that all women 40 and older should have an an@@ nu@@ al mammo@@ gra@@ m .
but as i left that night , i was certain that somehow i &apos;d tra@@ ded the life of my ever@@ la@@ sting sou@@ l for this one night with ro@@ y cam@@ pan@@ ell@@ a .
the sa@@ dd@@ le-@@ shaped structure is also known as a &quot; hyper@@ bo@@ lic par@@ ab@@ olo@@ id surface , &quot; or an &quot; an@@ tic@@ la@@ stic surface . &quot;
and of course we live in a society that &apos;s all about con@@ tradi@@ cting other peop@@ les &apos; reality .
and so what they &apos;re doing -- each of these artists on a nin@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch card , which they sell for 10 bucks , they dre@@ w original works of art .
thank you .
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
the cool@@ est thing would be is if you could diagno@@ se the disease early , and prevent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state .
sw : or maybe si@@ ren@@ a hu@@ ang would like to learn some ari@@ as on her vio@@ lin , and einstein can sing along with some oper@@ a ?
larger pac@@ ks at the beginning of the month , smaller pack@@ aging at the end of the month .
and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built .
and some people fall s@@ ma@@ ck in the middle of the intro@@ ver@@ t / ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ t spectrum , and we call these people ambi@@ ver@@ ts .
now let me show you how this works .
i had no prac@@ tical skills .
so if i take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion , your brain &apos;s circu@@ it@@ ry would understand inst@@ antly what &apos;s going on .
th : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and appropri@@ ate for me to be here at ted@@ women is that , well , i think it was su@@ mm@@ ed up best last night at dinner when someone said , &quot; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &apos; when the revolution starts , we &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with ra@@ ch@@ el car@@ son &apos;s &quot; sil@@ ent spring &quot; to the@@ o col@@ born &apos;s &quot; our stolen future &quot; to sand@@ ra stein@@ gr@@ aber &apos;s books &quot; living down@@ stream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot;
the first story is i didn &apos;t have any money -- that &apos;s a sign i used a lot .
i would re@@ com@@ mend it .
and like most par@@ as@@ it@@ es , it can begin dangerous , but then it co@@ evol@@ ves and adap@@ ts , and we end up with a sym@@ bio@@ tic relationship with this new par@@ asi@@ te .
je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os kin@@ dly , yesterday , said he &apos;ll put this video up on the amazon site -- some little cli@@ p of it .
i said , &quot; chris , that would take a mi@@ ra@@ cle . &quot;
kb : second sight is wh@@ ere@@ by a mind-@@ control exper@@ t can see through somebody else &apos;s eyes .
and you &apos;re all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that .
so it seems that the only tra@@ it that survi@@ ves de@@ cap@@ itation is van@@ ity .
conne@@ cting them together through con@@ fer@@ ences -- like a ted -- brings so many powerful conne@@ ctions , or through the world forum on social entrepreneur@@ ship that my foundation does at ox@@ ford every year .
it turns out it &apos;s because the no@@ vel@@ ty standard is too low .
this is all behavi@@ oral autonom@@ y here that &apos;s being condu@@ cted by the robot on its own .
the friend@@ ly support , the qu@@ ie@@ t confidence , con@@ gen@@ ial hospit@@ ality shown by our ha@@ wa@@ i@@ ian and military ho@@ sts -- this is starting -- made the experience enjo@@ y@@ able and un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and here is the story .
the next show that i &apos;m going to work on -- and i &apos;ve been bu@@ g@@ ging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science .
and then we need to consu@@ me less .
ch@@ or@@ us : da@@ is@@ y , da@@ is@@ y give me your answer do i &apos;m half crazy all for the love of you it can &apos;t be a sty@@ lish marriage i can &apos;t afford a car@@ riage but you &apos;d look swe@@ et upon the seat of a bicycle built for two ak : so ste@@ pping back for a quick second , when i was at ucla going to grad school , i was also working at a place called the center for em@@ bed@@ ded network sen@@ sing .
but i didn &apos;t want you to mis@@ s out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; por@@ tion@@ -@@ controll@@ ed meat cu@@ ts . &quot;
so , what i want you to think about for a few minutes is : how would you con@@ v@@ ey safety of the b@@ m@@ w ? okay ?
and she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom , but also fear , because we had just come out of cam@@ bo@@ dia .
he said , &quot; well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot;
dna accu@@ mul@@ ates information through ran@@ dom er@@ r@@ ors , some of which just happen to work .
and this was mau@@ rice wilkins . he was trained as a physi@@ c@@ ist , and after the war he wanted to do bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cs , and he picked dna because dna had been determin@@ ed at the rock@@ ef@@ eller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosom@@ es .
and similar topo@@ graphy .
you know , the fol@@ k tal@@ es of ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata and ra@@ may@@ ana , the two hol@@ y books , the ep@@ ics that everything comes out of in india , they say . after seeing that j@@ at@@ ra , the fol@@ k theater , i knew i wanted to get on , you know , and per@@ form .
you &apos;ll hear about talks like , can a video game make you cry ?
this is not science , but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can tra@@ ce our line .
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mi@@ xes to get this right , to hit our targets .
at ted@@ med , eric dis@@ h@@ man makes a b@@ old argument : the us health care system is like computing circa 195@@ 9 , te@@ ther@@ ed to big , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy central systems : hospit@@ als , doctors , nur@@ sing homes . as our aging population bo@@ oms , it &apos;s imper@@ ative , he says , to create personal , net@@ worked , hom@@ e-@@ based health care for all .
friend@@ ship , al@@ tru@@ ism , compassion , service – all the per@@ en@@ ni@@ al tru@@ ths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures -- once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-@@ interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
it &apos;s a 2@@ 65 million dollar industry and it &apos;s increas@@ ing rapi@@ dly .
your father , is he alive ?
this is where the last little nug@@ get of totally unknown terri@@ tory rema@@ ins on this planet .
if there &apos;s 3.@@ 5 billion now , it &apos;s going to be six billion then it &apos;s going to be 10 billion .
people built one bi@@ on@@ ic@@ le after another .
what war@@ ho@@ l said about co@@ ke is , he said , &quot; what i really like about coca-cola is the president of the united states can &apos;t get a better co@@ ke than the bu@@ m on the corner of the street . &quot;
this is a map of eight million phone us@@ ers in a european country .
this is a fl@@ oral theme calendar in 199@@ 7 , and this is a fire@@ work calendar . so , you laun@@ ch the number into space , because the japanese believe that when you see fire@@ works , you &apos;re cool@@ er for some reason .
i sup@@ pose what you mean is : what happens to the boat while i &apos;m sle@@ eping ?
and he wa@@ d@@ ded up the cla@@ y hor@@ se and he thre@@ w it back in the bin .
because i was from the united k@@ ing@@ dom , they thought the word nin@@ ja was a little too mean for children , so they decided to call it hero instead .
as a result , our comp@@ li@@ cations are significantly lower than what has been repor@@ ted in the united k@@ ing@@ dom , and you don &apos;t see those kind of numbers very often .
now , you &apos;re not going to hear a thing unless it h@@ its you .
now i &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
which , i guess , you know , communic@@ ates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the price .
the first i knew about this was when the coast gu@@ ard plane turned up over@@ head .
today we face the sc@@ our@@ ge of terrorism .
it had no limits . it was inv@@ inci@@ ble .
and when the vac@@ cine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who re@@ f@@ used to get it -- as a nice example of how people &apos;s fe@@ el@@ ings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wil@@ dly with no new information , with no new in@@ put .
who knows , maybe one day we &apos;ll even have our own james bond , right .
this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the net .
jan@@ ine she@@ pher@@ d : a broken body isn &apos;t a broken person
when we talk about power transition , we often talk about the rise of asia .
they &apos;re se@@ arch@@ ing for bush meat ; forest animals they can kill to feed their families .
coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal .
and last year , our population grew by 80 million .
now what &apos;s the right response to that ? &quot; yeah , right ! &quot;
and now , every cro@@ w within five kilome@@ ters is standing by a si@@ de@@ walk , waiting to collect its lunch .
it doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot;
a third interview was condu@@ cted with someone about the north pole .
i started experiment@@ ing , making models , talking to exper@@ ts in the field , taking their feedback , and refin@@ ing , and i kept on refin@@ ing and refin@@ ing for ni@@ ghts and wee@@ ken@@ ds for over five years .
there is something that made it that way .
but just go to the web , youtube , pull it down , &quot; folding t-@@ shir@@ t . &quot;
lyn@@ n made it to the top in a perfect pa@@ ir@@ ing of hollywood and science .
so think about that .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shir@@ t or a black shir@@ t .
and as teachers , after you get all the answers , you like to give them the corre@@ ct answer .
okay , we &apos;re going to start that verse again .
and it has a bin@@ ary comp@@ ani@@ on that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas .
this is really , really difficult .
so as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; man , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot;
or maybe there &apos;s some an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al evidence .
we &apos;ve done a lot of ou@@ tra@@ geous things in our lives , and we said , okay , local , what does &quot; local &quot; mean ?
so , jobs , basic services , finally , clean government .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could re@@ generate ?
except maybe french people .
and so you can start reading on your i@@ pa@@ d in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iphone .
and as we sit , ex@@ changing free ideas with each other , there are still people min@@ ing coal in order to power the ser@@ vers , extra@@ cting the min@@ er@@ als to make all of those things .
so , we have our gan@@ ges and y@@ am@@ un@@ a cle@@ an@@ up project .
so we ex@@ changed business car@@ ds , and we kept call@@ ing each other and decided to start this organization , friends of the high line .
and the ri@@ bo@@ some here is another little computer that hel@@ ps in the trans@@ lation of the proteins .
i would feel very isol@@ ated during these disc@@ us@@ sions .
yes , you te@@ ar up the &quot; el@@ event@@ h comm@@ and@@ ment &quot; -- national so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty .
now , the advan@@ tage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away .
so the very same pur@@ ch@@ ase , just tar@@ ge@@ ted toward yourself or tar@@ ge@@ ted toward somebody else .
we can use it to crack each other up , and we &apos;re going to do that .
and rele@@ as@@ ing this caused wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ trage .
ue : thank you very much .
we try and do more and more with less and less time .
it &apos;s all those things , and all those gut re@@ actions you have .
i knew that the dep@@ th of field was 18 in@@ ches or less .
it contro@@ ls all foreign media and image production outside of china from foreign media working within china .
it &apos;s one of those things .
and when i tell people about this , they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 .
when we &apos;re at our best , we reach out to people who are not like us , because when we do that , we learn from people who are not like us .
by actually taking the opportunity that new technologies , new interactive technologies , present to re-@@ scri@@ pt our interactions , to scri@@ pt them , not just as isol@@ ated , individu@@ ated interactions , but as collective ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating actions that can amount to something , we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges .
and i was in a dark place for a long time , un@@ able to create .
i used to think that reason and lo@@ gic and rel@@ ent@@ less drive were the only ways to make things happen .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful lou@@ is v@@ u@@ it@@ ton c@@ up tro@@ ph@@ y .
and the great innovation of chicken mc@@ nug@@ gets was not nug@@ get@@ fying them , because that &apos;s kind of an easy concept , but the trick behind chicken mc@@ nug@@ gets was , they were able to re@@ move the chicken from the bone in a co@@ st-@@ effective man@@ ner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy them .
okay . these are flat structures that we see here , the mus@@ cle .
it was to work with 3,000 offen@@ ders spli@@ t into three co@@ hor@@ ts of 1,000 each .
and we have this kind of -- as vot@@ ers , we have kind of a &quot; eu@@ re@@ ka ! &quot; moment .
and one of those dots is the same in the two pan@@ els . okay ?
it was bo@@ b met@@ cal@@ fe invent@@ ing the e@@ ther@@ net and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything .
so he built me the first bar@@ e@@ foot training center in sierra leone .
i would say , at least do this -- 10 years is enough to follow the trend .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 6@@ 5,000 feet into the atmosphere .
if that guy &apos;s going down to zero , i &apos;ll know .
and from a distance it appears that it &apos;s a single group .
and as we got closer , its signific@@ ance became appar@@ ent .
either they &apos;re the same , or this one &apos;s bigger than this one , or this one &apos;s bigger than that one .
they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world .
and last is that we &apos;re more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you &apos;re sitting next to someone .
what is the future of truly sustainable , car@@ bon@@ -@@ free energy ?
you want to have a hand@@ out that gives a lot more information , because the hand@@ out has to stand without you over here .
but i try to walk through life like this .
no , we just said all surge@@ ons .
&quot; he ate out , he saw shows , &quot; right ?
we think we &apos;re now at 95 percent accu@@ ra@@ cy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ kes .
well , the king co@@ bra is literally a ke@@ y@@ stone species in these rain@@ forests .
peter ward : yeah , every single cell in us can produce minute quanti@@ ties of hydro@@ gen sul@@ fi@@ de in great cris@@ es .
this is a $ 1 web ser@@ ver , and the possibility of making a web ser@@ ver for a dollar grew into what became known as the internet of things , which is literally an industry now with tremendous impli@@ cations for health care , energy efficiency .
a lot of times it &apos;s because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also .
and despite their fer@@ o@@ cious appe@@ ar@@ ance , tasman@@ ian de@@ vil@@ s are actually quite ad@@ or@@ able little animals .
and just to kind of put us in perspective , this is a picture of saturn taken with a space@@ craft from behind saturn , looking towards the sun .
so that &apos;s it for now .
no@@ wadays , particularly in the united states , if you meet someone at the bottom of society , they may un@@ kin@@ dly be described as a &quot; lo@@ ser . &quot;
and we found through this whole process , we found this great little manufactur@@ er in virginia , and if his body language is any indi@@ cation , that &apos;s the ow@@ ner — — of what it &apos;s like for a manufactur@@ er to work directly with a designer , you &apos;ve got to see what happens here .
suddenly , they started fighting .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary ven@@ ues for music .
or maybe it &apos;s chemicals .
and at that moment , the dog trans@@ formed into the buddha of love and kin@@ dness .
i know that i &apos;m not my body , and i also know that you &apos;re not yours .
they would always stop by to visit these huge win@@ ged bu@@ ll@@ s that used to gu@@ ard the gates of that ancient me@@ tro@@ poli@@ s , and the boy used to be sc@@ ared of these win@@ ged bu@@ ll@@ s , but at the same time they excited him .
not their fau@@ lt , hon@@ est@@ ly .
it needs months and years .
they were spi@@ ri@@ ted to safety . they were re@@ classi@@ fied as y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ v citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pur@@ su@@ ers for the du@@ ration of the war , survi@@ ving bur@@ n@@ ings and bom@@ b@@ ings and , at the end of the war , ar@@ rest by the so@@ vie@@ ts .
and that is , to no surprise , in shakespe@@ are , and in his play , ham@@ let .
including taking a small piece ad@@ jac@@ ent to the site and inv@@ iting 10 archite@@ cts who currently don &apos;t have a voice in new york to do artist hou@@ sing .
so clu@@ sters of galaxies will tend to form , because of all this gravit@@ ational attra@@ ction .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their prac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from successful emerging econom@@ ies in the south .
he told me to go in his room .
why are we setting up our schools this way and our work@@ places ?
all the peop@@ les that the baby@@ lon@@ i@@ ans had repres@@ sed and re@@ moved will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their go@@ ds .
the world &apos;s ambi@@ tious inno@@ v@@ ators and influ@@ en@@ cers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spo@@ ken word pretty much with@@ ered on the v@@ ine .
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don &apos;t seem to know this news .
i didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
how could one practice such a faith ?
once i prime the brain -- it &apos;s called cognitive pri@@ ming -- once i prime the brain to see it , it po@@ ps back out again even without the pattern that i &apos;ve im@@ posed on it .
many businesses now , fortunately , have co@@ des of condu@@ ct and au@@ dit their supply cha@@ ins , but not every business . far from it .
she ris@@ ks a lot and she &apos;s terri@@ fied .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flo@@ wers in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t .
i think there is something very pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly right in what these women are doing .
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very co@@ oper@@ ative animal .
any gu@@ esses ?
he had to get on the phone . this guy was always on the phone .
you can see , even if you don &apos;t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symme@@ try .
does anybody remember that ? &quot;
art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than dra@@ ma and dance . there isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that tea@@ ches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics . why ?
because i figured if i made it funny , you wouldn &apos;t be as thre@@ at@@ ened .
there are very , very few people who don &apos;t know now about what is happening in the ar@@ c@@ tic .
and so it was simply aston@@ ishing to me to find an organization that actually appreci@@ ated both those si@@ des .
this made it un@@ prof@@ itable for some farmers to even harv@@ est the gra@@ in from the fields .
the biggest langu@@ ages are ger@@ man , japanese , french -- all the western european langu@@ ages are quite big .
so at@@ titude : look , we &apos;re all going to get l@@ um@@ ps , and we &apos;re all going to get bu@@ mp@@ s .
some teams , we give people on the team some money for themselves and say , &quot; spend it however you want on yourself , &quot; just like we did with the under@@ gra@@ ds in canada .
you know , i was wonder@@ ing about freu@@ di@@ an determin@@ ants .
thank you .
and that is what this cy@@ lin@@ der is , the dec@@ lar@@ ation made by the rul@@ er gui@@ ded by god who had top@@ pl@@ ed the ira@@ q@@ i des@@ po@@ t and was going to bring freedom to the people .
so i always want to tell the story , like , one hand it is that , the other hand is that .
al@@ ong@@ side that is &quot; don &apos;t think twice , it &apos;s all right . &quot;
but first , i need to talk to you about a story , which is my story , about the story of this country that you &apos;re all here in today .
it &apos;s a mo@@ ose trying to cop@@ u@@ late with a bron@@ ze statue of a bis@@ on .
in this context i &apos;ll just show you a few .
there &apos;s what we call at@@ a@@ vis@@ m activ@@ ation .
so you see , this is not about doing good , this is about global growth and global emplo@@ y@@ ment .
he also explained to me that i had a bro@@ ther , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
what does the brand stand for in your head ?
and traffic plan@@ ners all around the world have tried lots of different meas@@ ures : den@@ se cities or dis@@ per@@ sed cities , lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bi@@ ke lan@@ es or more information , or lots of different things , but nothing seems to work .
and also , as a child , i was the fat@@ test kid in class , so i used to love chee@@ tos . oh , i love chee@@ tos , y@@ um@@ my .
but it &apos;s an in@@ her@@ ent part of our energy policy , which is we don &apos;t talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use .
it &apos;s more likely too much gl@@ u@@ co@@ se : blood sugar .
the classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been condu@@ cted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in the acade@@ mic liter@@ ature . so this took all of the tri@@ als that had ever been condu@@ cted on anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 15@@ -@@ year period by the f@@ da .
and then there &apos;s mon@@ arch@@ y and that &apos;s my role on the community , so ...
but the good news is they are out there .
and his gir@@ l@@ friend is probably not very happy about him either .
and here is full scale -- it &apos;s a tiny bone .
lau@@ rie san@@ tos looks for the ro@@ ots of human ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ ality by watching the way our pri@@ mate rela@@ tives make decisions . a clever series of experiments in &quot; mon@@ ke@@ yn@@ om@@ ics &quot; shows that some of the sil@@ ly choices we make , mon@@ keys make too .
and i &apos;m not that nai@@ ve , because a lot of the time i &apos;ve been asked , many times i &apos;ve been asked , &quot; yeah , but , this is really nai@@ ve , sen@@ ding flo@@ wers over , i mean — &quot; i was in the ar@@ my . i was in the par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers for three years , and i know how it looks from the ground .
but my jo@@ y@@ ful period was mar@@ red by so@@ le@@ m@@ n and mor@@ bi@@ d thou@@ ghts -- thou@@ ghts of walking through the pris@@ on &apos;s high-@@ security death row , as this was the only route to take me to the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft oper@@ ating room .
in fact , on a good day , we might have four or five human beings at the average dep@@ th of the earth -- maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we &apos;ve got going .
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
the next thing is : what about the footprint ? ste@@ wart men@@ tioned the footprint .
but lots of people now live to 90 or 100 , unless they shake hands too much or something like that .
it is time for us to a@@ im higher when it comes to women , to inv@@ est more and to de@@ plo@@ y our dollars to benef@@ it women all around the world .
now , we can &apos;t actually take a movie of this process , but sha@@ wn dou@@ glas at harvard has made a nice visu@@ alization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .
but there was a third advan@@ tage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
i &apos;d also like to point out that sound doesn &apos;t o@@ be@@ y bo@@ un@@ dar@@ ies .
the world was never told there was a day of global c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire and non@@ violence .
we have no ex@@ cu@@ se in this country . i &apos;m sorry .
so the er@@ a of big infrastructure is over .
it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that i described .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re per@@ cei@@ ved as fa@@ ke , as a ph@@ ony company -- adverti@@ zing things that you &apos;re not .
to find the path to long life and health , dan bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner and team study the world &apos;s &quot; blue zones , &quot; communities whose el@@ ders live with vi@@ m and vig@@ or to recor@@ d-@@ setting age . in his talk , he shares the 9 common diet and lifest@@ yle hab@@ its that keep them sp@@ ry past age 100 . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and it &apos;s one of the difficult things is that when people have pre@@ concep@@ tions of how it all works , it &apos;s quite difficult to shift those .
and we also found bacteria that normally in@@ hab@@ it the gut .
sar@@ ah kam@@ in@@ sky : my father the for@@ ger
they said , &quot; well , it kind of looks like a tail . &quot;
while still in a research phase , stem cells may one day her@@ ald a quantum lea@@ p in the field of car@@ di@@ ology .
i was 1@@ 9 years old at the time .
so what do you do when the information is all around you ?
dh : all right , let &apos;s show them something special .
games on the surface seem simple enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment , but for those that like to look a little deep@@ er , the new paradigm of video games could open enti@@ rely new fron@@ ti@@ ers to creative minds that like to think big .
there &apos;s a world bank , arms de@@ al@@ ers and a united nations .
all of a sudden your gps read@@ out goes blank , and now it &apos;s just you and the fo@@ g and whatever you can pull off the rad@@ ar system if you remember how to work it .
but then , the people from ir@@ dn@@ c proposed to jo@@ shu@@ a : what if we pay people that you trust to look after wild@@ life ?
he even taught me the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theor@@ em .
and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a nap@@ k@@ in . i grab@@ bed a piece of graph paper -- i &apos;m a physi@@ c@@ ist .
we can start to figure that out .
so we decided that we needed a set of rules , and we came up with a number .
two different myth@@ ologi@@ es , two different ways of looking at the world .
so there is now an al qaeda in the islam@@ ic ma@@ gh@@ re@@ b , there &apos;s an al qaeda in the arab@@ ian pen@@ insu@@ la , there is an al qaeda in mes@@ o@@ po@@ tam@@ ia .
you have to have low cost , but you also have to have a function .
&quot; something &apos;s wrong with the air condi@@ tion@@ er -- sm@@ ell of bur@@ ning v-@@ bel@@ ts in the air . &quot;
so information is beautiful . data is beautiful .
and this is what she said .
and so to give you an idea of an an@@ al@@ og@@ y of what i mean by thinking of can@@ cer@@ ing as a ver@@ b , imagine we didn &apos;t know anything about pl@@ um@@ bing , and the way that we talked about it , we &apos;d come home and we &apos;d find a lea@@ k in our kitchen and we &apos;d say , &quot; oh , my house has water . &quot;
no bill ever disappe@@ ared .
it leaves 25 or 30 percent for oil , gas , coal , nuclear , or whatever .
this theory and others like it are long sh@@ ots .
we can &apos;t see them directly .
chee@@ to paint is a very simple way to paint with chee@@ tos .
at the moment , the story that we colle@@ ctively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff , that we need oil .
then we &apos;ve got the model s , which starts at around 50,000 dollars .
and they were going to spend the rest of their lives , usually , in this ir@@ on lung to brea@@ the for them .
i &apos;m looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 3@@ 6 , which was only four percent of the population , so now i &apos;m de@@ aling with the possibility of 3@@ 0,000 men .
that little ge@@ ar there swit@@ ches back and forth to change direction .
what can governments learn from the open-@@ data revolution ? in this stir@@ ring talk , be@@ th no@@ ve@@ ck , the former de@@ pu@@ ty c@@ to at the white house , shares a vision of prac@@ tical op@@ en@@ ness -- conne@@ cting bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cies to citizens , sharing data , creating a truly partici@@ pat@@ ory democracy . imagine the &quot; wri@@ table society &quot; ...
do you have that love ?
that &apos;s not sustainable either .
pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors were perfectly trained .
anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future .
so there &apos;s a network of computers that are challen@@ ged to solve a very complex mathematical problem and the person that man@@ ages to solve it first gets the bit@@ co@@ ins .
in the future they will look like that , because we need to move away from those type of poly@@ mers and use that for medical equi@@ p@@ ment and more important things , perhaps , in life .
bon@@ uses , com@@ mis@@ sions , their own reality show .
and one of our biggest success@@ es is we get mail from teen@@ age girls in the middle of i@@ o@@ wa who say , &quot; i googl@@ ed j@@ essi@@ ca simp@@ son and st@@ um@@ bled on your site .
so i f@@ ought for about five years doing this , and it was one of many hundreds of requ@@ ests that i made , not -- i didn &apos;t -- hey , look , i didn &apos;t set out , hon@@ est@@ ly , to revolutionize the british parliament .
but i think , above all , i &apos;m in a@@ we at their power to motiv@@ ate , to com@@ pel us , to trans@@ fix us , like really nothing else we &apos;ve ever invented has quite done before .
australi@@ ans have about a third less heart disease than we do -- less deaths from heart attacks , heart failure , less stro@@ kes -- they &apos;re generally a health@@ ier bunch .
then mon@@ arch@@ y had seen off its big challen@@ ger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but do@@ om@@ ed experiment , just as cap@@ ital@@ ism has seen off soci@@ al@@ ism .
the bill gates song !
what you &apos;ll see is that the rhyth@@ ms of growth , of ve@@ ge@@ tation -- a sub@@ set of which is food on the contin@@ ents -- is directly ti@@ ed to the rhyth@@ ms of the sea surface temper@@ atures .
because pi@@ cking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren &apos;t doing equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um analysis as well .
this is what our planet looks like from ou@@ ter space at ni@@ ght@@ time , if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet . and the thing you would notice first , of course , is how domin@@ ant the human presence on our planet is .
in africa , small farmers bear the br@@ unt of this risk .
these people inspi@@ re me , and they inspi@@ re me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world , change the way you look at your place in the world .
god no , it was therapy .
some food waste , as i said at the beginning , will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably ar@@ ise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
if you ask anyone , &quot; what is mor@@ ality based on ? &quot;
that means there &apos;s literally thousands of new ideas .
whenever you work on that level , things be@@ have different .
in the 17@@ th century , a woman named gi@@ u@@ lia to@@ fan@@ a had a very successful per@@ fu@@ me business .
this is the tar@@ get site , the world &apos;s deep@@ est hydro@@ ther@@ mal spring at cen@@ ote z@@ ac@@ at@@ on in northern mexico .
it spread almost enti@@ rely through word of mou@@ th , vir@@ ally , across teachers , parents , people involved in education .
and the conclusion of that is that psych@@ ology and psych@@ i@@ at@@ ry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miser@@ able people less miser@@ able .
these adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
plan@@ s have already been announ@@ ced for a lot of those garden a@@ part@@ ments above the m@@ all to be re@@ developed .
she has been in exi@@ le you ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exi@@ le ?
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a sub@@ urban las v@@ eg@@ as neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
we need , you know , 30 days on 1,000 process@@ ors to do the kind of simulation that i showed you before .
of course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surprising .
half of e.@@ r. ad@@ mis@@ sions from adoles@@ c@@ ents are for conc@@ us@@ sions .
can we maybe be much more sele@@ ctive and create better environ@@ ments that also benef@@ it from dar@@ k@@ ness ?
we take our money and we give it away .
and she put her head back and she said , &quot; it feels like le@@ ap@@ ing into hea@@ ven . &quot;
they were quite proud of the fact that you know , before the du@@ st cle@@ ars , if some soldi@@ er has been hurt they will have colle@@ cted him or her , they will have brought him back , they will be getting worl@@ d-@@ class tri@@ age emer@@ gen@@ cy care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states .
we had the bur@@ sting of the tech bubble .
in some states , sen@@ ior water rights hol@@ ders can leave their water in-@@ stream while leg@@ ally prote@@ cting it from others and main@@ ta@@ ining their water right .
i &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are dis@@ associated from trees in their lives .
and if we are to be ste@@ wards of our planet earth and its bio@@ sphere , we &apos;d better understand the cosmic signific@@ ance and do something about it .
only one in a thousand lea@@ ther@@ back hat@@ ch@@ l@@ ings will reach ma@@ turi@@ ty .
there &apos;s no closed cap@@ tioning for the ted theme song , and we &apos;re missing it , but if you &apos;ve watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind &apos;s e@@ ar , and then appl@@ ause starts .
the solution is not going to be more cars , more roads or a new ra@@ il system ; it can only be found , i believe , in a global network of inter@@ connected solutions .
and it &apos;s not just cat@@ er@@ ers , it &apos;s hot@@ eli@@ ers , it &apos;s re@@ tail@@ ers , it &apos;s anyone who provi@@ des services to the public or businesses .
and the wa@@ it@@ er can come by and say , &quot; would you like more water ? &quot;
he was very frustrated with how software got designed .
we are here on top .
but if you &apos;re the leader on it , at the har@@ dest move , you &apos;re looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle s@@ labs .
the other ti@@ tle that we launched is called &quot; secret pa@@ ths in the forest , &quot; which addres@@ ses the more fan@@ tas@@ y-@@ ori@@ ented , inner lives of girls .
and then i said , &quot; oh , my god . what did i say ?
the most important point i want to make to you about this is the sa@@ cre@@ d and somewhat over@@ -@@ roman@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed do@@ ct@@ or@@ -@@ patient one-@@ on-@@ one is a reli@@ c of the past .
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a pris@@ on@@ er .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
all right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
i was in bei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ dding for the olymp@@ ic games .
why not ask all of the states to do that instead ?
o@@ op@@ s , i &apos;m sorry . what was going on ?
it also exists in more conventional game forms .
we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among weal@@ thy countries .
and demand that the people who teach you ac@@ knowledge them and celebrate them too .
ok , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
there &apos;s nobody i &apos;ll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years , so we thought that &apos;s a perfect place where we should situ@@ ate our plan and let our imagination take flight .
because obviously , if being in the gang were such a wonderful , lu@@ cra@@ tive job , why in the world would these guys mo@@ on@@ light at mcdonald &apos;s ?
now , we have many ways to study natural vari@@ ability .
this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the mel@@ ting of the gl@@ ac@@ ier .
you can &apos;t really -- well , you can &apos;t see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of pa@@ yo@@ ff , in a sense .
we treat biot@@ echn@@ ology with the same sc@@ ru@@ tiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
now , am i saying that in every department of motor vehi@@ cles across the land , you find a stage two culture ?
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike ali@@ ens and dinosau@@ rs , we look at human faces every day .
and this happens constantly in the writing .
why him ?
h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the marsh@@ mal@@ low ; one out of three did not .
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adv@@ ent@@ ures human beings have em@@ bar@@ ked upon , which is the qu@@ est to understand the universe and our place in it .
and then four lights , with swit@@ ches , and even a circu@@ it break@@ er , mod@@ el@@ ed after an electric bell .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provi@@ des a lot of company .
instead , i think we should look a little bit larger .
thank you very much indeed .
you have your molecular comp@@ il@@ er , you can do whatever you want .
so , what i &apos;m going to tell you today , is a little bit of why i think that &apos;s the case , and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where i think it &apos;s going , where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer .
we &apos;re watching the ris@@ ing of the stars and the shi@@ f@@ ting of the ti@@ des .
and it &apos;s called aff@@ or@@ dab@@ ili@@ ty .
here &apos;s a little picture of der@@ ek going up now , when you were with your nan@@ ny .
and so i asked ja@@ wa@@ d , &quot; how do you guys na@@ vig@@ ate ? this is a really di@@ verse community .
if you take a look at these sc@@ ans that we have of emi@@ ly , you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different fac@@ ial expres@@ sions .
and this , this is the im@@ plan@@ table generation .
it &apos;s what my friend vern@@ a said : wake up and take control of your health .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expan@@ sive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
this is a slightly different angle , and again a s@@ low motion version of this .
in ad 9@@ 8@@ 4 vi@@ k@@ ings went out to green@@ land , se@@ tt@@ led green@@ land , and around 14@@ 50 they died out -- the society collap@@ sed , and every one of them ended up dead .
they know nothing at all , whatsoever , about you .
i still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
while we try to manage dec@@ lin@@ ing marine popu@@ lations , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding increas@@ ed consumption of se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
but later , i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pi@@ x@@ els , also .
and they basically said , &quot; this is un@@ accep@@ table , &quot; and then the pun@@ ch@@ line : &quot; so , de@@ an , we &apos;re here because you make medical stuff .
what we don &apos;t look for is value for many , while we are gener@@ ating value for money .
there &apos;s an in@@ fr@@ ared be@@ am that &apos;s going across , and he has ste@@ pped into the be@@ am and taken his photograph .
but it was really bru@@ tal .
all these small health ga@@ ins and small pieces of the puzz@@ le make a big difference .
and it turns out , that there was one telephone in b@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h for every 500 people .
they want to visit us , see what &apos;s happening on the ground and make a decision .
but of course , they are har@@ d-@@ wired but we use them still in a sophi@@ st@@ icated way .
this is the &quot; double rain@@ drop . &quot;
now appe@@ aran@@ ces , of course , can be de@@ cep@@ tive , and to an ex@@ tent , this fei@@ sty , ener@@ ge@@ tic person@@ a of le@@ ctu@@ re-@@ going and traffic c@@ one ste@@ aling was a ven@@ e@@ er , al@@ b@@ eit a very well-@@ cra@@ fted and convin@@ cing one .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major am@@ pul@@ late silk .
and the first surgery of the day happened to be an ob@@ st@@ et@@ ri@@ cal case .
the first step was to ask a question .
it &apos;s kind of a forward o@@ smo@@ sis .
case in point , einstein .
tor@@ sten rei@@ l talks about how the study of biology can help make natur@@ al-@@ looking anima@@ ted people -- by building a human from the inside out , with b@@ ones , mus@@ cles and a ner@@ v@@ ous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in g@@ ta@@ 4 .
we will be an over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly urban species .
the baby bottle scen@@ ari@@ o pro@@ ves that we can prevent un@@ necess@@ ary ex@@ pos@@ ure .
it &apos;s a story passed on generation after generation .
well , that &apos;s exactly what i want to talk about today , is how we can use these natural forces to re@@ medi@@ ate these man@@ -@@ made problems .
i would not have my new hi@@ p for ted@@ 2008 .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the head@@ lights on your lam@@ bor@@ gh@@ in@@ i .
we tried it against flu a viruses -- h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 , h@@ 3@@ n@@ 2 -- as well as flu b viruses .
it &apos;s a win@@ -@@ win trade : i give you phosphor@@ us , and you feed me .
but we have no idea what we &apos;re going find when we go out there with our technology .
and it &apos;s going to change as i go through it .
i really think that &apos;s there &apos;s this inner desire .
in certain countries , mosqu@@ e min@@ are@@ ts are being ban@@ ned .
so , to conclu@@ de , intelligent power can , glob@@ ally , save thousands of lives , prevent tens of thousands of in@@ ju@@ ries , and elimin@@ ate tens of billions of dollars in proper@@ ty damage every single year , while significantly reducing global energy consumption .
and i said , &quot; but here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood sh@@ it . &quot;
thank you .
le@@ opar@@ ds have pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted from 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 down to a m@@ ere 50,000 .
i wanted to test the limits of the system .
and now a card with a contr@@ ast of five of clu@@ bs .
let me show you that idea visu@@ ally .
i &apos;d -- there &apos;s one story i &apos;d just like to men@@ tion .
and it &apos;s these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimul@@ ated it .
and this is an ex@@ cer@@ pt from my first edi@@ tor &apos;s le@@ tter , where i say that ro@@ okie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still fig@@ uring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspi@@ re them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and ro@@ okie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
and i learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
you return to where you started .
we had stories like &quot; the se@@ ven@@ -@@ leagu@@ e boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stri@@ de you could cover seven leagu@@ es , or 2@@ 1 miles , a kind of travel completely uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to people without that kind of energy at their dis@@ pos@@ al .
here is thomas mann talking about symme@@ try in &quot; the magic moun@@ tain . &quot;
so , instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which cri@@ mes are com@@ mitted where , and we have to emplo@@ y people in government to try and hold the police to account , suddenly , we &apos;ve got this vast opportunity for people power , where we , as citizens , can see what cri@@ mes are being com@@ mitted -- where , when and by wh@@ om -- and we can hold the police to account .
and if i go down and look at ni@@ ger , where there was such a terrible fam@@ ine , la@@ stly , it &apos;s like this . the 20 percent po@@ or@@ est of ni@@ ger is out here , and the 20 percent rich@@ est of south africa is there , and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa .
so t , e , d is the same as f , e , d .
angel@@ ine came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any cri@@ teria that we had .
so , what was the impact of that ?
and in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away .
but , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
so those are the questions that my colleagues and i at d-@@ re@@ v ask ourselves .
and here &apos;s the third factor , which is totally different .
and let me show you what &apos;s behind it .
the electricity power@@ ing the lights in this theater was gener@@ ated just moments ago .
so , mars is a pretty big place even though it &apos;s half the size .
some la@@ sted 14@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half minutes .

the teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mou@@ th of the fish , it would actually imp@@ ale its own brain .
sometimes they just explo@@ de before your eyes or come down super@@ son@@ ic .
if you &apos;re watching this now , i hope you can for@@ give me .
the present port@@ able device is far from opti@@ m@@ ally designed , both as to human fac@@ tors as appe@@ ar@@ ance .
we have no consi@@ st@@ ent testing .
stephen bra@@ d@@ ley : i thought i saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appe@@ aring to say to me , &quot; come . &quot;
education scientist sug@@ ata mit@@ ra tac@@ kl@@ es one of the greatest problems of education -- the best teachers and schools don &apos;t exist where they &apos;re needed most . in a series of re@@ al-@@ life experiments from new del@@ hi to south africa to ital@@ y , he gave kids self-@@ super@@ vis@@ ed access to the web and saw results that could revolutionize how we think about teaching .
that &apos;s our value pro@@ position in a prize .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
here is a map . all they have is a cas@@ in@@ o on it .
martin lu@@ ther called the printing press &quot; god &apos;s highest act of gra@@ ce . &quot;
until i got to the true young global leader , shi@@ mon per@@ es , president of isra@@ el , and he ran a beautiful manipu@@ lation on me .
j@@ s : now , there &apos;s now a real fan@@ cy in@@ vention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it ki@@ cks it out .
again , opportunity to t@@ ack@@ le markets to get that higher price .
psychop@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers are the basis for some mu@@ st-@@ watch tv , but what really makes them ti@@ ck ? neuro@@ scientist j@@ im fall@@ on talks about brain sc@@ ans and genetic analysis that may un@@ cover the ro@@ tten wir@@ ing in the nature of mur@@ der@@ ers . in a to@@ o-@@ str@@ ange@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ fi@@ ction twi@@ st , he shares a fascinating family history that makes his work chil@@ l@@ ingly personal .
and that &apos;s why i suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it .
now lo@@ l , we generally think of as meaning &quot; lau@@ gh@@ ing out loud . &quot;
but whenever you &apos;ve got really new technology , it generally takes about three major versi@@ ons in order to make it a comp@@ elling mas@@ s-@@ market product .
i must tell you i am like that , not very comfortable , because usually , in life , i think my job is absolutely u@@ sel@@ ess .
it is the magic of science .
so democracy has become mer@@ ely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies .
i &apos;m th@@ ri@@ ll@@ ed to be here .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .

why is it that women are , on the one hand , vi@@ ci@@ ously op@@ pres@@ sed by cultural practic@@ es , and yet at the same time , are the pres@@ er@@ vers of cultures in most societies ?

next . and this is something deep@@ er , and this is where i &apos;m — i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the feynman bi@@ ographi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private proper@@ ty rights .
5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied 200 houses for me in afghanistan .
suddenly , in the mi@@ d-@@ 4@@ 0s , there started to be a bu@@ zz .
recent events have high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted , under@@ lin@@ ed and b@@ ol@@ ded the fact that the united states is per@@ forming b@@ lan@@ k@@ et sur@@ v@@ ei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce on any foreig@@ ner whose data pas@@ ses through an american enti@@ ty -- whether they are suspe@@ cted of wr@@ ong@@ doing or not . this means that , essentially , every international us@@ er of the internet is being watched , says mi@@ k@@ ko h@@ yp@@ po@@ nen . an important rant , wra@@ pped with a ple@@ a : to find alternative solutions to using american companies for the world &apos;s information needs .
but he could memor@@ ize all the needs of all the beings that he is , he will , he did .
the wind map , by wat@@ ten@@ berg and fern@@ and@@ a vi@@ é@@ gas , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever seen it -- it &apos;s really fantastic .
so we sent an under@@ cover investig@@ ator in to secre@@ tly film meetings with members of the rul@@ ing eli@@ te , and the resul@@ ting foot@@ age , well , it made some people very angry , and you can see that on youtube , but it pro@@ ved what we had long suspe@@ cted , because it showed how the state &apos;s ch@@ ie@@ f minister , despite his later den@@ i@@ als , used his control over land and forest licen@@ ses to en@@ rich himself and his family .
now the last option was the lon@@ gest , and the most difficult : to sa@@ il 1,500 miles du@@ e south in hop@@ es of re@@ aching a certain band of win@@ ds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
and in ger@@ many , if you would like to don@@ ate your organs -- god for@@ bi@@ d something really bad happens to you -- when you get your driving licen@@ se or an i@@ .@@ d@@ . , you check the box saying , &quot; i would like to don@@ ate my organs . &quot;
at the time , there was a micro@@ len@@ ding group in the village that gave her a 6@@ 5@@ -@@ dollar lo@@ an .

i mean , somebody pa@@ ys you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h and all that stuff .
thank you .
i bel@@ ong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 20@@ 4 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
for example , i get people to dres@@ s up their vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers .
we have gps &apos;s in all of our tru@@ cks .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simpli@@ city .
the history of our world is these decisions .
so once those pictures are ac@@ qui@@ red and the physi@@ cian has dra@@ wn all the necess@@ ary safety limits and so on , he sele@@ cts basically a point -- you see the ro@@ und point in the middle where the cur@@ s@@ or is -- and he pres@@ ses this blue butt@@ on called &quot; son@@ ic@@ ate . &quot;
the bad news is , this drug doesn &apos;t actually treat all cases of cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis , and it won &apos;t work for dan@@ ny , and we &apos;re still waiting for that next generation to help him .
and when it comes to sensory re@@ stor@@ ation , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
do we care about the planet for our children ?
and this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the m &amp; amp ; ms .
ok , now , imagine the connection , ok .
all across the developing world there are millions of parents -- tens , hundreds of millions -- who for the first time are with children doing home@@ work and exam@@ s .
so being an american , i decided to set up a cau@@ cus .
so the presence of the power and the band@@ wid@@ th in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to conver@@ ge in a man@@ ner that is just un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented .
and for the ve@@ ter@@ ans in particular , the v@@ .@@ a@@ . said there &apos;s a six-@@ fold increase in mental health phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als by ve@@ ts since 2003 .
we are doing the sequ@@ est@@ ration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees .
and that leads to a very powerful tool .
i know that we have syste@@ matically an@@ ni@@ hil@@ ated the girl cell .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
i have visions of people going down alle@@ y@@ ways y@@ elling out for her@@ cles , and you get char@@ ged by this thing and you go , oh , please be her@@ cles ; please be the friend@@ ly one .
it turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instin@@ ctively mir@@ r@@ or@@ ing , mi@@ mi@@ cking their op@@ ini@@ ons .
now that ti@@ tle , that phrase , comes from a cri@@ tic , an early cri@@ tic , and this is a passage that i just love , and would like to read for you .
so it &apos;s enough to bur@@ y any industry .
and maybe they succe@@ e@@ ded . maybe they succe@@ e@@ ded .
and i wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed the good news through my broken ja@@ w , which was wired shu@@ t , to my night nur@@ se .
as the sound starts to pulse and contra@@ ct , our physi@@ ci@@ sts can tell when a phot@@ on is going to be em@@ it@@ ted .

do you have an american express in your wal@@ let ?
i wi@@ shed to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us , but how we respond to what happens to us .
just so you know , i am not dr. stran@@ gel@@ o@@ ve .
the bottom board of this three-@@ dimensional , the board of trans@@ national relations , things that cross bor@@ ders outside the control of governments , things like climate change , drug trade , financial flo@@ ws , pande@@ mi@@ cs , all these things that cross bor@@ ders outside the control of governments , there nobody &apos;s in charge .
and what about , oh , i can &apos;t see any interesting me@@ mes here .
they will completely lose .
then we did what i consider to be the heart of the work : intervie@@ wed 1,@@ 100 children , bo@@ ys and girls , ages seven to 12 , all over the united states -- except for silicon valley , boston and au@@ stin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn &apos;t be a represent@@ ative sa@@ mp@@ le .
thank you very much .
they have needs which have to be met effici@@ ently in terms of energy , in terms of cost , in terms of quality .
mark sha@@ w demo@@ s ultra@@ -@@ ever dr@@ y , a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ rep@@ ell@@ ent co@@ ating that acts as an aston@@ is@@ h@@ ingly powerful shi@@ eld against water and wat@@ er-@@ based materials . at the nan@@ o level , the spray covers a surface with an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a of air so that water bo@@ un@@ ces right off . watch for an exciting two-@@ minute ki@@ cker .
so if i &apos;d have done this in 199@@ 4 , i could have predi@@ cted what wal@@ m@@ art would be now .
if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth , and i held up another square that was the root two square -- so it &apos;s 1.@@ 5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans ; and i said , what is the rela@@ tive value of these two things ?
you ought to be able to go to a psych@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist or a psych@@ ologist , and put down your 10@@ -@@ dollar cop@@ a@@ y , and get treated , just like you do when you got a cut on your arm . it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s interpretation of the impli@@ cations of your work , kind of like the mo@@ z@@ art metaph@@ or , where , &quot; oh , m@@ ris show that play en@@ han@@ ces your intelligence .
and i think that is an expan@@ sion of your moral comp@@ ass when you manage to do that .
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
this is why they did not ac@@ cept .
so for instance , if you &apos;re afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a nee@@ d@@ le , we do mi@@ cr@@ one@@ ed@@ le ar@@ rays .
blin@@ ker@@ ed vision ten@@ ds to produce , i think , blin@@ ker@@ ed solutions .
so if you were a little tiny bu@@ g living in a flo@@ wer , what would that flo@@ wer look like , if the flo@@ wer was this big ?
thank you . thank you .
the m@@ c would impro@@ vis@@ e lyri@@ cs in the same way that the jazz pla@@ yers would impro@@ vis@@ e melo@@ dies .
though he was no law@@ yer , he argu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t himself the next day . he won the rul@@ ing , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
if you think about the phone -- and in@@ tel has tested a lot of the things i &apos;m going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 el@@ derly hou@@ se@@ holds -- 300 in ireland , and 300 in port@@ land -- trying to understand : how do we measure and monit@@ or behavior in a medi@@ cally meaningful way ?
this kind of cor@@ nu@@ cop@@ ia of stuff just coming and never en@@ ding is amazing , and we &apos;re not ama@@ zed .
by now i know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
but more progress has been made , i think , in the last few weeks than had been made for some years .
it &apos;s a c@@ d , it &apos;s a little bit more comp@@ res@@ sed image .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab al@@ lies , including tun@@ isi@@ a , to stamp out extre@@ mis@@ m in their societies , and this ima@@ m found himself suddenly in the cros@@ sha@@ irs of the tun@@ isi@@ an intelligence service .
you &apos;re born , you pe@@ ak at mi@@ d@@ life and dec@@ line into decre@@ pit@@ u@@ de .
everybody wanted one of these electric was@@ hing machines .
some of you are old enough to remember : he was the cha@@ ir@@ man of the house of represent@@ a@@ tives and he res@@ ig@@ ned in dis@@ gra@@ ce when this young republi@@ can named new@@ t g@@ in@@ gr@@ ich found out about a sha@@ dy book deal he had done .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the ou@@ ter world is limited , temporary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
it &apos;s a beautiful building . we decided we would re@@ fur@@ bis@@ h it and then put out the word : we &apos;re going to start the best math institute in africa in this hotel .
she wanted a dom@@ e somewhere in the house .
and all this past year in training , i had that ted@@ dy roo@@ sev@@ elt quote to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase it , flo@@ ating around in my brain , and it says , &quot; you go ahead , you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the cri@@ tic , you be the obser@@ ver , while the bra@@ ve one gets in the ring and eng@@ ages and gets b@@ loo@@ dy and gets dirty and fa@@ ils over and over and over again , but yet isn &apos;t afraid and isn &apos;t ti@@ mi@@ d and lives life in a b@@ old way . &quot;
it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to man@@ date , if you &apos;re going to have the privilege of ac@@ cess@@ ing our high se@@ as resources , we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you &apos;re doing .
now , i remember when i was about 15 , i read a copy of life magazine , which deta@@ iled a story about a 7@@ 5@@ -year-old blind rus@@ si@@ an woman who could sense prin@@ ted letters -- there &apos;s still people trying to do it here -- -- who could sense prin@@ ted letters and even sense colors , just by touch .
she saw some simil@@ ari@@ ties in one of the photographs , but couldn &apos;t quite make a positive identifi@@ cation .
and here are the du@@ cks again .
tho@@ m may@@ ne : how architecture can connect us
they ti@@ ed the re@@ bar right , they po@@ u@@ red the colum@@ ns right , and that building will be safe .
the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room .
it &apos;s e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally sound ; it stop@@ s the population explosion of fo@@ xes . &quot;
and we &apos;re working in an area called sou@@ thern ka@@ yon@@ za , which is one of the po@@ or@@ est areas in r@@ wand@@ a , with a group that origin@@ ally inclu@@ des about 40@@ 0,000 people .
so -- where do you go putting all of these dis@@ par@@ ate pieces together ?
it &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get fi@@ j@@ ian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in fi@@ j@@ i .
i &apos;m doing it so we can identify what we &apos;re up against .
the essen@@ ce of what he said was this : the people most affected by the deva@@ station and loss of life do not want intelle@@ ctu@@ al theor@@ ies about how god let this happen .
b@@ ma has exp@@ and@@ ed .
anth@@ ony at@@ al@@ a : printing a human ki@@ dney
and this is my son working with me on a small fa@@ st-@@ food thing .
but they a@@ in &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ gely created , and i can agree on that .
this is the hard one , the one that isn &apos;t obvious . that &apos;s why i leave it to the end .
i can measure my ste@@ ps , my cal@@ or@@ ic out@@ take .
and so , if you &apos;ll put up with this , i would like to en@@ list your help with a first experiment today . the experiment is -- and i notice , by the way , that when you appl@@ au@@ ded , that you did it in a typical north american way , that is , you were rau@@ c@@ ous and in@@ co@@ her@@ ent .
and as we did that , the number of repor@@ ted cases in the world dro@@ pped to zero , and in 19@@ 80 we dec@@ lar@@ ed the glo@@ be free of small@@ po@@ x .
there was a period in which people talked about an act of creation , because these institutions were so new .
and if i were to write a volu@@ me , it would be called , &quot; artists who have led my exhibi@@ tions &quot; because my work , in understanding art and in understanding culture , has come by follo@@ wing artists , by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .
dh : one more , one more .
in 1993 they dec@@ lar@@ ed the end of the ar@@ med struggle .
he has given ey@@ es@@ ight to two million people for free .
now this became my new secret identity , and the first thing i did as a s@@ layer was call my twin sister -- i have an identical twin sister named kel@@ ly -- and tell her , i &apos;m playing a game to he@@ al my brain , and i want you to play with me .
and you can always walk .
when he recei@@ ved his a@@ ward , he said these lo@@ vely words : &quot; the children can lead africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot;
this is what goes on in my studio everyday . i walk -- i &apos;m travel@@ ing . i come back .
and here &apos;s a little image of that .
if the end game is global warming , they &apos;re doing great .
that &apos;s a mista@@ ke that could literally cost us our future .
he begins by expla@@ ining how science works through the testing of hypo@@ thes@@ es that are fra@@ med to be vulnerable to dis@@ proof , and then he goes on .
un@@ cle gets dr@@ unk , doesn &apos;t use con@@ dom . come back , start again . &quot;
and so the ment@@ or mother went along with .
they lack nutri@@ ents , and di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates them .
now , what we were care@@ ful to do was , vitamin d is made by ultravio@@ let b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin d story .
well within a few days i &apos;m able to do one cros@@ sing .
now , there was a big effort to solve this problem , and there was actually a big solution .
i can be in the sou@@ th@@ west mon@@ soon .
it &apos;s not just a question of cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
and , for example , wol@@ fra@@ m alpha and mathema@@ tica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by se@@ arch@@ ing the compu@@ ta@@ tional universe .
same thing in the clin@@ ic waiting room .
that &apos;s what i really want to focus on .
we got inv@@ ited to do the whole thing in new york , and in london , and in los angeles .
this slide was shown before . this is the famous j@@ ur@@ assi@@ c bird arch@@ a@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x .
so , what i &apos;d like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um .
it &apos;s a little different than the way we think about brain dis@@ or@@ ders like hun@@ t@@ ington &apos;s or par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s or al@@ z@@ hei@@ mer &apos;s disease where you have a bom@@ bed@@ -@@ out part of your cortex .
you see , a lot of the people that i most ad@@ mi@@ re , they &apos;re great artists , great designers , great thin@@ kers , they &apos;re le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand@@ ed .
in fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in paki@@ stan .
but wood is the material that i love the most , and i &apos;m going to tell you the story about wood .
thank you very much .
here &apos;s a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and compar@@ ing that to hiv , a much wil@@ der tar@@ get .
i don &apos;t think that cham@@ ber has evolved because of me and my back@@ ho@@ e and my cre@@ w of students with pi@@ ck@@ ax@@ es , but instead because when there &apos;s f@@ loo@@ ding , occasi@@ on@@ ally the col@@ ony has to go down deep .
and she decided , despite the ad@@ vice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be viet@@ nam@@ ese so that we could have a chance to survive , because at this point they &apos;re for@@ cing everybody to work .
and co@@ al-@@ bur@@ ning fur@@ n@@ ac@@ es are going in there for hydro@@ electric power literally wee@@ k@@ ly .
and that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
what makes something wor@@ th@@ while for me is the people i work for or with , the conditions i work under and the audience that i &apos;m able to reach .
we live in a galaxy , the mil@@ ky way galaxy .
take it out of an american hospital , send it over@@ se@@ as to a crow@@ ded facili@@ ty in asia , here &apos;s how it &apos;s actually used .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only pa@@ d@@ dy fields , and since we inv@@ ited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
thanks .
in some , they wear mas@@ ks .
she repli@@ ed immediately , &quot; i know about nap@@ kins , but if i start using nap@@ kins , then we have to cut our family mil@@ k budget . &quot;
so if you look at the little scri@@ pt here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
then , suddenly , a thought occur@@ red that kind of put a ble@@ mis@@ h on my amazing plan here .
we call this cru@@ st@@ al magne@@ tis@@ m .
well we have two obje@@ ctive meas@@ ures .
it &apos;s a 50 / 50 shot of a thousand or 2,000 , or just 1,500 dollars with certain@@ ty .
so if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
we extra@@ po@@ late back@@ wards and say the galaxy is up here .
he wa@@ des in to above his wa@@ ist .
i love the appar@@ ent truth of theater .
the first thing is , we &apos;re very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advan@@ ced than when other countries had the development .
you should just nu@@ dge them in the right direction .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the ur@@ chin@@ s , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again .
what the ni@@ geri@@ an writer chin@@ u@@ a a@@ che@@ be calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
so we saw the prote@@ stant re@@ formation .
so no wil@@ der@@ ness , no re@@ vel@@ ations .
i wish that sexual ab@@ use and explo@@ itation in schools would stop . &quot;
we do not follow instru@@ ctions . and so on .
it &apos;s a computer where the people are the parts .
you have no idea what someone &apos;s going to c@@ ough into a c@@ up , and it &apos;s probably really complex , right ?
and the good news , this one &apos;s a mon@@ ster .
they &apos;re not ideas , they &apos;re instin@@ cts .
so now i &apos;m going to get to my ted business .
i worked in the schools . i found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area , from the jun@@ k , onto the fres@@ h food : six-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half gr@@ and per school .
i just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
and super@@ markets , i find this is very sho@@ cking , it &apos;s very , very attra@@ ctive to walk along a super@@ market .
so , we &apos;re going to start off looking at the white ball -- and i &apos;m going to tell you which color , and i &apos;m also going to tell you to go with your fing@@ ers . ok ?
and great art would have &quot; head &quot; : it would have interesting intelle@@ ctu@@ al ideas and concep@@ ts .
there is the position of the sun , moon and planets on the mov@@ able re@@ te .
a 4@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction .
it &apos;s not a sin . &quot;
what we see , however , are two over@@ la@@ pping tri@@ angl@@ es .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fa@@ te of these bear families , and indeed that of all be@@ ars around the north pac@@ i@@ fic , depen@@ ds on the sal@@ mon .
that was &#91; un@@ clear &#93; also -- you know , because we were wor@@ ried about the risk of it , but it worked pretty well .
when i was in high school , i got my first phili@@ ps re@@ el@@ -@@ to-@@ re@@ el tape recor@@ der , and tape recor@@ ders became my sort of pre@@ -@@ computer medium of learning .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
sw : and a pig ?
they want us to fit in even better .
but one day of coal ad@@ ds up to one hell of a lot of carbon di@@ oxide in a normal one-@@ gi@@ ga@@ watt co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red plant .
sup@@ pose mar@@ ti@@ an scientists came to earth .
what howard mo@@ sko@@ witz was doing was saying , this same revolution needs to happen in the world of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce .
you see him all the time .
but by and large , this is a feedback loo@@ p that &apos;s so ni@@ f@@ ty and too rare .
i call it my z@@ .@@ e.@@ n@@ . clu@@ ster .
p@@ m : i don &apos;t think so .
when we are in medical school , we learn our an@@ atom@@ y from illu@@ stra@@ tions such as this where everything &apos;s color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
the off switch is in there somewhere .
i would wake him up at , like , 6 : 30 in the morning to ask him who &apos;s the best po@@ et .
here &apos;s a simple game to get us started .
em : i mean , you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reas@@ on@@ able number .
and my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread .
he will ur@@ in@@ ate and spin his tail to spread the ur@@ ine around and make him more attra@@ ctive .
you , your miser@@ ab@@ len@@ ess , have got to be ki@@ dding . &quot;
so we actually tried to com@@ mission some cr@@ ash tests .
so , let me just show you .
we want to neu@@ tr@@ alize the ten@@ sions . we want clo@@ sen@@ ess .
le@@ gl@@ ess , with only one arm , il@@ liter@@ ate , uns@@ killed -- what job for him ?
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it van@@ ish in my face .
you see that south america and africa may be connected in a certain way , right ? other people say , &quot; oh , that sounds ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; it &apos;s simple . so , what shaped lan@@ ce ?
don &apos;t even worry .
both right before the s@@ wa@@ p and five days later , people who are stuck with that picture , who have no choice , who can never change their mind , like it a lot !
it &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
that big shi@@ eld that you see outside , that &apos;s a he@@ at shi@@ eld which is going to protect it .
and because i don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
we &apos;ve only been around for the past 200@@ ,000 years as a species , yet we &apos;ve reached a population of more than six and a half billion people .
we launched a website on september 2@@ nd that has now ser@@ ved 25 million pages , and has 4@@ 2,000 regi@@ ster@@ ed young girl us@@ ers .
we are not bor@@ ro@@ wing energy from our neighbors .
i jo@@ ined comp@@ us@@ erve when it had fe@@ wer numbers than i currently have follo@@ wers on twitter .
consider the 2008 terror@@ ist attack on mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i .
and i am re@@ minded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them , as po@@ tent as the mi@@ cr@@ on@@ es@@ ian na@@ vig@@ ators , that are going dis@@ mis@@ sed , that this is a te@@ stam@@ ent to brilliant , brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is van@@ ishing rapi@@ dly .
it &apos;s a competition we &apos;re holding , the second x prize , for the first team to sequence 100 human genom@@ es in 10 days .
and of course , it made me question , if i wasn &apos;t able to have another child , what would that mean for my marriage , and just me as a woman .
god cannot be glam@@ or@@ ous because god is om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent , om@@ nis@@ cient -- too far above us .
and in one of our labs , jack s@@ zo@@ sta@@ k &apos;s labs , it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environ@@ ments -- which are very common on planets , on certain types of planets like the earth , where you have some li@@ qu@@ id water and some cla@@ ys -- you actually end up with natur@@ ally available molecules which spon@@ taneously form bub@@ bles .
and , of equal importance is , we test ar@@ es in the earth &apos;s atmosphere , at 100,000 feet , which is compar@@ able to the den@@ sity and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we &apos;ll fly .
so what do we make of that ? first of all , we know that you &apos;re all brilliant .
l@@ b : well , you know , as r@@ on st@@ . john -- i hope you &apos;ll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him -- when he started g@@ ph@@ in -- in 199@@ 7 , there was an out@@ break of bird flu .
in fact , the chinese minister of finance said to me , when i asked him what are we doing wrong in ni@@ ger@@ ia .
they &apos;re all exc@@ la@@ ma@@ tion points .
it &apos;s a global imper@@ ative . we have to get this right .
if you go on the ground there , it looks like this , and this is the gran@@ da@@ d@@ dy coral .
and it &apos;s this incredible balance that i think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground , that &apos;s trying to do something you &apos;ve never seen before , that imag@@ in@@ ary world where you actually don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going to end up , that &apos;s the fine line on the edge of a cr@@ ater that i have walked my whole life .
eight .
so , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years .
now grid cells are found , again , on the in@@ puts to the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , and they &apos;re a bit like place cells .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ on@@ ies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really wor@@ ried about losing this seg@@ ment of our industry .
these are the people who spent 4@@ 0,000 dollars on flat screen t@@ v@@ s when they first came out , even though the technology was sub@@ standard .
and also , like facebook and google , they claim they are friends of the mouse , but sometimes we see them d@@ ating the cat@@ s .
it &apos;s written around 18@@ 3@@ 4 , so , even though it &apos;s old , i hope you like it .
they engine@@ ered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continu@@ ously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists .
at that point , i became a little more ambi@@ tious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .
love , action .
what contro@@ ls aging ? bio@@ chem@@ ist cy@@ n@@ thia ken@@ y@@ on has found a simple genetic mu@@ tation that can double the li@@ fes@@ pan of a simple wor@@ m , c. ele@@ gan@@ s . the lessons from that discovery , and others , are poin@@ ting to how we might one day significantly ex@@ tend you@@ th@@ ful human life .
and la@@ stly , to the slightly ob@@ sc@@ ure world of entrop@@ y -- the second law of thermodynam@@ ics .
the first is , it &apos;s essen@@ tial for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
i promis@@ e you that most of you will have got that .
but whatever the countries on the right are doing they are doing a much better job than beg@@ ging .
but that &apos;s not the case .
these rapid collap@@ ses are especially likely where there &apos;s a mis@@ match between available resources and resour@@ ce consumption , or a mis@@ match between economic out@@ la@@ ys and economic potential .
there &apos;s also ac@@ ini@@ form silk , which is used to wra@@ p pre@@ y .
what they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other .
they in@@ spe@@ ct it , they check it for cra@@ cks , for dri@@ ll damage , for sp@@ all@@ s , for chi@@ ps .
what it does is it creates an adver@@ s@@ ari@@ al relationship between civil society and government over the control and ow@@ ner@@ ship of information .
sort of like a digital j@@ im@@ iny -- as in the well-@@ known fair@@ y tale -- a kind of friend@@ ly , suppor@@ tive presence that &apos;s always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy hab@@ its .
so we think , first and fore@@ most , aids is a policy issue .
i took the cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen subway map and i ren@@ am@@ ed all the sta@@ tions to abstra@@ ct musi@@ cal pro@@ vo@@ cations , and the pla@@ yers , who are synchr@@ oni@@ zed with stop@@ wat@@ ches , follow the ti@@ met@@ ables , which are li@@ sted in minutes past the hour .
night after night , he took me up on the ter@@ race , on his shoul@@ ders , and poin@@ ted out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me .
now this story doesn &apos;t start with vast telescop@@ es or fu@@ turi@@ stic space@@ craft , but a rather more hum@@ ble technology -- and in fact , the very medium which gave us the tele@@ communic@@ ations revolution that we &apos;re all part of today : the telephone .
they &apos;d been told that these is@@ lands , and several others near@@ by , were popul@@ ated by can@@ ni@@ b@@ als .
but on that moun@@ tain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind , what are we really achiev@@ ing ?
if you look car@@ efully , you can even see a hin@@ t of the app@@ le men@@ u , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally pun@@ ched through to the physical .
so i &apos;ve shown you some of the first generation of retro@@ f@@ its .
it seem@@ ed so intui@@ tive to me .
let me tell you about ma@@ hab@@ u@@ ba .
can we hold it together ?
and we &apos;re doing this on the second largest oil reser@@ ves on the planet .
but scienti@@ fically , they &apos;re amazing because they &apos;re sent@@ in@@ els .
it ru@@ ined my life -- &quot; the in@@ convenient truth &quot; and mr. g@@ ore .
now , of course , we were normally fri@@ ghten@@ ed because the animal has no gli@@ ding adap@@ tations , so we thought , &quot; oh that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll put it in a ver@@ tical wind tun@@ ne@@ l .
&quot; great -- got it . &quot;
just like it wasn &apos;t tv and only better .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
i said , &quot; was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful ? &quot;
now look again at this .
so as i shake this ket@@ ch@@ up bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
je : when you got this call out of the blue -- tony &apos;s really sh@@ y , and it took a lot of convin@@ cing to get somebody as mo@@ dest as tony to allow us to bring lu@@ ke .
if technologies don &apos;t last and pers@@ ist , we will not succeed .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the sil@@ ence .
if you need surgery , you want to be oper@@ ated on by a boar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied surge@@ on .
millions of people have contribu@@ ted their des@@ k@@ top computers when they &apos;re not using them to link together through the internet into super@@ computing colle@@ cti@@ ves that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that &apos;s folding @ home at stanford -- to crack co@@ des , to search for life in ou@@ ter space .
so we can now look at the smar@@ t@@ bird .
a conscious approach to design , i &apos;m call@@ ing it bio@@ in@@ formed design , and i think it &apos;s possible .
so if i ask you to access a memory , like , what is that ?
but for me , i have another reason to be an in@@ cur@@ able opti@@ m@@ ist .
i had a girl who came up who said , &quot; my dad says you &apos;re the de@@ vil . &quot;
so it &apos;s been several years since i got my own tat@@ too .
actually , they &apos;re not . my son isn &apos;t . how d@@ are you ? &quot;
i would claim that art and culture , and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting in the times we &apos;re living in now , have pro@@ ven that one can create a kind of a space which is both sensi@@ tive to individu@@ ality and to colle@@ ctivity .
it &apos;s a very sa@@ d story .
and they are going to distur@@ b our dreams until we do the right thing .
that &apos;s lower than the figure in the united states .
we will see the further evolution of this kind of busin@@ ess@@ -@@ class mor@@ ality .
that was a jo@@ ke , actually , and i -- ok .
and that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ changing between groups .
it was a few years ago , but i sort of remembered this story , and i told it at a conc@@ ert .
so i took the hus@@ b@@ ands along .
it &apos;s concep@@ tu@@ al . it &apos;s universal . it &apos;s beyond words and numbers .
well , it &apos;s always kind of funny when he comes up and ho@@ vers .
so this is my nie@@ ce , char@@ lot@@ te .
it &apos;s clear that we have a responsibility to help li@@ ft them out of poverty .
well , one of the things i discovered is that exper@@ ts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper , the adv@@ ance dire@@ ctive , to help families get past the seem@@ ingly ir@@ rational choices .
if you have 500 gra@@ ms , 1@@ 000 , one kil@@ ogra@@ m , he will gr@@ ind it for it for you ; the fl@@ our@@ mil@@ l will not gr@@ ind such a small quanti@@ ty .
and of course , from here , we can go and zo@@ om in and see , well , what are young people looking at ?
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
then another character was a half-@@ woman , half-@@ chee@@ ta@@ h -- a little ho@@ mage to my life as an ath@@ le@@ te .
the dan@@ ger is not at all un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented . species go extin@@ ct all the time .
it went for 1,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king bei@@ j@@ ing with h@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u and shanghai .
so i &apos;m holding it , and i &apos;m about to touch that tube on its shoul@@ der , and when i do , you &apos;ll see biol@@ umines@@ cence coming out .
we can get sho@@ wers up to 8@@ 6 percent working , we can get electrical systems up to 7@@ 7 percent working , and we can get 90 percent of toi@@ lets working in those 7@@ ,@@ 500 houses .
this is actually a heart val@@ ve , which we engine@@ ered .
archite@@ ctural photograph@@ y -- ju@@ li@@ us schul@@ man , who has talked about trans@@ figuration , took this fabul@@ ous , famous picture of the kau@@ ff@@ man house .
and the choice of men@@ u and ti@@ ming is quite flexible .
they don &apos;t stick by vel@@ cr@@ o or su@@ ction or gl@@ ue .
so i tend to do those things .
no , no , no , no , no .
what happened instead is he very car@@ efully docum@@ ented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community .
another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
we want to add entrepreneur@@ ship and policy skills .
but i was saying thanks all the time , every day , and i started to change my perspective .
and they &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m just saying , you know .
we also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience , with private founda@@ tions .
and please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ servative .
big support team . we had a film cre@@ w , a couple of logi@@ stics people with us , my gir@@ l@@ friend , a photograph@@ er .
and mr@@ i is ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely sensi@@ tive for finding tumor@@ s , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
so it ten@@ ds to get dis@@ coun@@ ted .
and i learned that one person can make a huge difference .
step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
you see the person live .
he said , &quot; a human being is a part of the whole , called by us , the &apos; universe , &apos; -- a part limited in time and space .
today i &apos;m going to show you an electric vehicle that wei@@ gh@@ s less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall out@@ let in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilome@@ ters on about a dollar of electricity .
public demand -- the more the public dem@@ ands the redu@@ ction of chemicals , the more gro@@ wers become aware of the fact they should , wher@@ ever they can and wher@@ ever possible , re@@ place the chemical control with biological control .
our ene@@ mi@@ es sh@@ all talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own con@@ fusion .
then they said , &quot; okay let &apos;s see if there &apos;s any cultural bias here .
on five , four , three , two , one -- open your eyes , wide a@@ wake .
ask about what kind of prote@@ ctive equi@@ p@@ ment is available .
we went back 50 years to the 195@@ 9 / 1960 television season .
five percent of our greenhouse g@@ ases are produced by mo@@ wing our law@@ ns .
and my wee@@ k@@ ly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
my thesis for you is that by comb@@ ining international , inter@@ agency , priv@@ at@@ e-@@ public , strate@@ gic communication , together , in this 21@@ st century , we can create the sum of all security .
people like jo@@ sh and steve are continu@@ ing to layer information upon information , re@@ al-@@ time information , twe@@ et it and text it onto these maps for all to use .
and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day , all you do is look at the ro@@ of , and it &apos;s a really sh@@ it@@ ty experience .
there &apos;s bill e@@ aster@@ ly &apos;s book .
so , this is not something pretty and nice to do .
we &apos;re already starting to see early re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment occu@@ r this year .
and so then , i was sitting in class , and suddenly it hit me : i could comb@@ ine what i was reading about , carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , with what i was supposed to be thinking about , anti@@ bodies .
but let &apos;s go back to safety , because everybody after fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma had to reas@@ s@@ ess the safety of nuclear , and one of the things when i set out to design a power re@@ ac@@ tor was it had to be passi@@ vely and in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally safe , and i &apos;m really excited about this re@@ ac@@ tor for essentially two reasons .
i have been changed with my children .
&quot; as our case is new , so we must think an@@ e@@ w and act an@@ e@@ w .
with the largest number of medi@@ ca@@ id patients , each of those has at least 20,000 college students .
let me just show a map of ri@@ o again .
or can you move beyond my v@@ eil and see me for who i truly am inside ?
thank you . thank you .
it was the techni@@ que of feynman diagra@@ ms .
people say , we don &apos;t really want to live in a little teen@@ y conventional apartment .
the experiments are incredibly simple .
so , as k@@ ev@@ in kel@@ ly poin@@ ted out , there is no end@@ game .
t@@ m : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
but what is most important here is , who do we finance ?
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
so we started explor@@ ing this material called et@@ fe .
one of them actually , fit@@ t@@ ingly enough , found me when i che@@ cked into a del@@ i at a restaurant in new york on four@@ square .
we &apos;ve tri@@ pl@@ ed the miles that we drive since 19@@ 70 and dou@@ bled them since 198@@ 2 .
some people say , &quot; well , that &apos;s just because those m@@ ba types are gre@@ e@@ dy . &quot;
and they say to me , &quot; stop comp@@ la@@ ining . &quot;
now , to do that , we need to be able to bring a camera and instru@@ ments in together through one small tube , like that tube you saw in the la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y video .
and you actually don &apos;t have a lot of op@@ tions .
that &apos;s what it feels like to me .
and here &apos;s her po@@ em .
the fe@@ der@@ al government ab@@ di@@ cated most responsibility .
and so you spend your days fighting things off , defen@@ ding your terri@@ tory and becoming more ent@@ ren@@ ched in your fundamental thinking .
we &apos;ve got to put back what &apos;s been lost .
i &apos;ve car@@ ried this photograph with me every day since then .
i &apos;ve got five in@@ ches of ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment here in order to get the head@@ rest in the right place .
and we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
that would be an olymp@@ ic event : turn a squ@@ irre@@ l loo@@ se -- wh@@ o@@ ever cat@@ ches the squ@@ irre@@ l , you get a gold me@@ d@@ al .
a lot of potential of young children is wa@@ sted .
so i made up my mind at that moment that classi@@ cal music is for everybody . everybody .
men are not frequ@@ ently part of pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy care .
it &apos;s very har@@ sh conditions .
there &apos;s not a stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry tree or a car@@ rot bush .
an intelligent re@@ cep@@ tac@@ le prev@@ ents in@@ ju@@ ries because the power is always off , until an intelligent plu@@ g is dete@@ cted . simple .
it has four bal@@ con@@ ies .
as re@@ moved as we the domin@@ ant society may feel from a massa@@ c@@ re in 18@@ 90 , or a series of broken tre@@ a@@ ties 150 years ago , i still have to ask you the question , how should you feel about the statistics of today ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that many , many muslims believe -- the vast maj@@ ority , in fact -- in fact i think i would go so far as to say that many muslims in sau@@ di arab@@ ia believe that the core values of islam , nam@@ ely ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gement of god &apos;s so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty and basic human equality before god , are themselves com@@ pati@@ ble with liber@@ ty , equality and free political choice .
this is a picture of f@@ og@@ ging .
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future , and this is cho@@ sen as an example .
but i want to argu@@ e , above all , a big@@ -@@ picture positive for this world .
but that &apos;s not good enough .
and you &apos;re looking at it from the off@@ ices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
one year later , how she is .
then they can &apos;t get any larger because they don &apos;t have a blood supply , so they don &apos;t have enough oxygen or nutri@@ ents .
and although a lot of that is about energy , it &apos;s also so much about carbon .
but the ipo@@ d won ! this is the one they wanted .
less and less phosphor@@ us will be available .
you focus on the for@@ eg@@ one option .
you can use dna origami for that .
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look sil@@ ly ?
here &apos;s how to do it at room temperature and pressure , using non-@@ toxic materials . &quot;
and eco@@ si@@ a works in pretty much the same way .
that is like an an@@ ish ka@@ poor flo@@ wing through a richard ser@@ ra .
the climate has changed . i will show you : no more f@@ loo@@ ding , no more fir@@ es .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
so it was absolutely gi@@ gan@@ tic .
so they were asking questions that were significant to exper@@ t scientists .
we &apos;re doing great . we &apos;re doing fine .
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
but in retro@@ spe@@ ct , the destruction of my self was so repe@@ ti@@ tive that i started to see a pattern .
and you know what ?
they were making sc@@ ary faces to play the car@@ ic@@ ature of themselves .
it &apos;s a self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling prophe@@ cy . we can &apos;t get out of it .
she took him to the v@@ et and the v@@ et discovered something quite dis@@ gu@@ sting .
and as you get a little bit closer , it starts looking like lots of pi@@ pes , like maybe a chemical plant , or a refin@@ ery , or maybe a hel@@ lish free@@ way inter@@ change .
unless there &apos;s anybody in the audience that would like to volunte@@ er to stop eating ?
now we did a very simple experiment .
so i ran@@ g up , asked paul far@@ mer if he would help .
but we can see them through their dna , we can see them through the effects that they have on people .
that &apos;s why we need care from our parents .
having cho@@ sen a particular path , i can hold my hand on that path as infin@@ itely many different jo@@ in@@ t con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions .
and there are all kinds of play -- cla@@ y for finger de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity , word games for reading success , large motor play , small motor play . i feel like i could de@@ vote my life to fig@@ uring out what to play with my kids . &quot;
and the kind of science that can be done will be determin@@ ed by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instru@@ ment@@ ation to the table .
do they have the resources to face up to a serious pande@@ mic ?
there are many many ways that nature fil@@ ters water that takes s@@ alt out of water .
and this is jack gei@@ ger , who &apos;s one of the heroes of the u.s. public health community .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s bil@@ ly gra@@ ham , the pre@@ a@@ cher . &quot;
now , what you &apos;re having here is basically a global brain that you &apos;re able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it &apos;s thinking .
when the molecule incre@@ ases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it lo@@ cks down into that re@@ cep@@ tor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .
what we &apos;re looking at here is the insi@@ di@@ ous cost of ring@@ t@@ one pi@@ ra@@ cy .
and we still don &apos;t know why this is happening .
it is now anybody with access to a $ 1,500 computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently .
and the same -- well , if we could do that we &apos;d auto@@ matically have an energy supply , because the trans@@ mu@@ tation would be a fusion re@@ ac@@ tor -- and evidence ?
because back then , video camer@@ as were just starting to become popular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . and since this came in on a fri@@ day , they were able to get this great foot@@ age of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virg@@ ina , mar@@ y@@ land , pennsylvania and new jer@@ se@@ y until it did that to a car in new york .
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; robot in sc@@ ans@@ ori@@ al environment &quot; -- that &apos;s a cli@@ m@@ bing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologi@@ sts and engineers creating this robot .
right ?
and so they were very clever about the way that they pac@@ ka@@ ged car@@ -@@ sharing .
so , one question i often get after this talk -- so i figured i &apos;d answer it now -- is , well , what happens to the animal ?
s@@ lot@@ h , gi@@ ra@@ ffe , elephant , sna@@ ke . okay , let &apos;s see what we got .
so whole gra@@ in brea@@ ds histor@@ ically have had sort of this on@@ us of being health food brea@@ ds , and people don &apos;t like to eat , quote , health food . they like to eat healthy and health@@ ily , but when we think of something as a health food , we think of it as something we eat out of ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , not out of passion and love for the fla@@ vor .
maybe there are emotional stam@@ pe@@ des that ri@@ pp@@ le through social networks .
now , what usually happens when we &apos;re learning to be min@@ d@@ ful is that we get distra@@ cted by a thought .
mar@@ ge simp@@ son : hom@@ er , please .
and i didn &apos;t mean , you know -- where is that lady ?
the biggest reser@@ vo@@ ir , the ocean , was the least well measu@@ red , until more than 3,000 ar@@ go flo@@ ats were distribu@@ ted around the world &apos;s ocean .
this is their we@@ dding video .
is this possible ? is it really possible that we could do this ? &quot;
someone comes into the clin@@ ic , they have a fe@@ ver , they feel bad . what do they have ?
we &apos;ve got to ho@@ ok them up with parents .

local j@@ i@@ had , if you ignore it , becomes global j@@ i@@ had again .
and these are the things that get him through his day .
here &apos;s sort of the sch@@ edu@@ le , and i put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting .
the brain isn &apos;t actually putting the detail in your head at all .
mark lyn@@ ch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a de@@ ar friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his com@@ ic book class hal@@ f@@ way through the course , and i was so excited , i was beam@@ ing .
it did not cor@@ rel@@ ate with the size of class@@ rooms .
we have a mathematical fra@@ me@@ work based on gener@@ ic universal principles that can answer those questions .
and you &apos;re on one side or the other .
i thought , okay , i will go out .
and perhaps most important of all , it is un@@ sustainable because of climate change , resour@@ ce de@@ ple@@ tion and species destruction .
and this leads to the second life .
we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people ; we &apos;re about to em@@ bar@@ k on that .
yet , that &apos;s the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice .
j@@ ab@@ bar : then what about the rest of us ?
but thank you so much for coming . that was absolutely fascinating .
now you &apos;d ask , can this be done at scale ?
there &apos;s always a different scen@@ ari@@ o that you can sk@@ et@@ ch out where it &apos;s possible that something could have been done differently .
this is a fun one .
but of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
if there &apos;s one thing that we want to learn from the library of alex@@ and@@ ria version one , which is probably best known for bur@@ ning , is , don &apos;t just have one copy .
obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
that &apos;s right , cyber@@ cri@@ min@@ als do have christmas par@@ ties , as it turns out .
but then eventually it grew into 12 countries , and those are the 12 stars on the european fla@@ g .
then we sort of cut up the volu@@ me , so we wouldn &apos;t block the view from my apartment .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bo@@ li@@ vian edge of the amazon , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look really car@@ efully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one far@@ mer out there in the middle of the pri@@ me@@ val jung@@ le .
there are no special effects in &quot; up@@ wake , &quot; no artifi@@ ce .
i &apos;ll give you a couple seconds .
well , this t@@ v-@@ industrial complex in@@ formed my entire childhood and probably yours .
indeed , we carry a lot of lu@@ g@@ ga@@ ge from our yester@@ year in the human brain .
sometimes i think back to that night in the e.@@ r .
at the same time , we actually had a vis@@ it@@ or -- a minister from a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an came to our office .
by the third time , in all 4@@ 2 cases , we have achiev@@ ed success .
you would agree with me that light doesn &apos;t pen@@ et@@ rate through walls .
mike de@@ gr@@ u@@ y was also inv@@ ited , and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean , and he also talked to me about appl@@ ying my approach to something he &apos;s been involved with for a very long time , which is the h@@ unt for the giant squ@@ id .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high al@@ titude moun@@ ta@@ ine@@ ering trip in re@@ verse , except that you &apos;re now running a str@@ ing of these things down .
i started re@@ acting , but then i tried to remember to go to the bal@@ con@@ y .
and someone wrote just on youtube -- it was a youtube com@@ ment : &quot; first time i s@@ mil@@ ed doing a der@@ i@@ va@@ tive . &quot;
you see it all like this .
now i didn &apos;t hear those stories from the poor themselves , i heard them from my sun@@ day school teacher and jesus , kind of vi@@ a my sun@@ day school teacher .
let &apos;s charge them a bo@@ at@@ lo@@ ad of cas@@ h for this and see what they think .
that is the reason why i felt it was imper@@ ative that i pres@@ ented you with this copy of the gay agen@@ da .
and -- so the way i saw this in my mind at first , was that the pieces would explo@@ de up and out with infin@@ ite speed , and the pieces would move far out , and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravit@@ ational feel , to the point where they would approach infin@@ ite speed back to the center .
they &apos;ll have cities with no energy and no food .
in the oil and min@@ ing se@@ ctor , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transpar@@ ency standard that could t@@ ack@@ le some of these problems .
so if i gave you that picture , i don &apos;t want to go too long on that .
and we almost s@@ ank the ship , but i became en@@ ra@@ p@@ tured with moun@@ ting expedi@@ tions . and over the last 49 years , i &apos;ve done about 120 , 12@@ 1 -- i keep doing them -- expedi@@ tions .
and really realized that that was because -- as tra@@ ders would tell me over and over -- that &apos;s the only way people know what they &apos;re getting in terms of the quanti@@ ty and the product quality .
and here are two different images of the archi@@ me@@ des manus@@ cri@@ pt .
thank you .
the fa@@ a , the controll@@ ing body above all , calls it a &quot; powered li@@ ft air@@ craft . &quot;
one has one that actually wal@@ ks with a surpris@@ ingly human@@ -@@ like ga@@ it , that &apos;s built out of molecules .
after all the ten@@ se moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there &apos;s one photograph from a much qu@@ ie@@ ter place that ha@@ un@@ ts me still , much more than the others .
but i also learned very soon there@@ after that jesus also said , and i &apos;m par@@ ap@@ hr@@ as@@ ing , the poor would always be with us .
it &apos;s produced to get sul@@ fu@@ r out of gas@@ ol@@ ine -- which i find is somewhat ir@@ on@@ ic .
plu@@ g@@ ged me into the wir@@ es , put me to sleep , gave me the mus@@ cle rel@@ ax@@ ant .
we &apos;ve had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers .
and when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
now , did all of this end with the islam@@ ic revolution in 197@@ 9 ?
and i just ate it up .
i &apos;ve had some great me@@ als at caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as .
it activ@@ ates the same areas in the brain .
i want you to just stand exactly like this for me , pull up your sle@@ ev@@ es , if you don &apos;t mind .
now , steve , look back .
so , on au@@ gu@@ st 15@@ th , indepen@@ dence day , 2007 , the children of ri@@ ver@@ side set out to infe@@ ct ah@@ me@@ dab@@ ad .
so i went in for an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und .
the threat is des@@ er@@ ti@@ fication .
shri@@ mp far@@ ms are a sc@@ our@@ ge on the earth , fran@@ k@@ ly , from an environmental point of view .
i know that you are angry , and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activi@@ ties of re@@ ven@@ ge . but , &quot; he said , &quot; what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel .
the financial crisis is really a relatively small histor@@ ic phenomen@@ on , which has just ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated this huge shift , which ends half a millenni@@ um of western as@@ cen@@ dan@@ cy .
and we came to a star@@ tling conclusion .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for prev@@ ent@@ ing a@@ vian flu . thank you .
the hei@@ ght of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the al@@ ps in most cases .
and so she thought , well , what the he@@ ck .
noise goes up , heart rate goes up .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s and &apos; 9@@ 0s when islam@@ ism started in the region , it spread across the men@@ a region as a whole .
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depres@@ sed , and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m sle@@ eping a lot . &quot;
of course , we know today that galaxies ex@@ tend far beyond our own galaxy .
so , it &apos;s simple . all you need are those top qu@@ arti@@ le teachers .
but , well , as i said , i mean , car dri@@ vers ada@@ pt , right ?
i found that i didn &apos;t have to wear high he@@ els , i didn &apos;t have to wear p@@ ink , and i could feel like i fit in .
so there &apos;s a lot of great things , but i &apos;d love to see more cor@@ rid@@ ors getting retro@@ fit@@ ting .
with him and with ro@@ sal@@ ie , what seems to be going on -- and ro@@ sal@@ ie said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot; -- and i said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any in@@ put , they become hyper@@ active and exc@@ itable , and they start to fire spon@@ taneously .
that &apos;s a high gross marg@@ in business . i like it .
this is actually from one of -- the paper that she transl@@ ated .
do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
and that current , electrical current , is car@@ ried by electr@@ ons , just like in your house and so on .
we had to study from study books .
and of course , today , with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyp@@ ing , etc . , we have the mechan@@ is@@ ms to understand and to respond to these systems , and to allow them to adjust to the various ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ tions of func@@ tion@@ alities because that &apos;s all we do .
but the beauty of it is that it &apos;s just silk and sticks .
so , really even challenging the notion of what can be consi@@ dered a story .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist and i show in art g@@ aller@@ ies and muse@@ ums .
and then back@@ tra@@ ck innova@@ tions within that .
we were fortunate to work with another group at stanford that built us a special man@@ ned sens@@ or , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
and two ta@@ stes which protect you -- bit@@ ter and s@@ our , which are against po@@ is@@ on@@ ous and ro@@ tten material .
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
number one , this matters because this repres@@ ents more than a billion people .
where it goes in the future is questi@@ oned . so that &apos;s the human part .
so we won the competition to build the u.k. pa@@ vili@@ on .
so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
and some , in any event , are too big to use for bu@@ t@@ cher@@ y .
but even with a co@@ w@@ boy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
in fact , chris was wor@@ ried and said , &quot; look , don &apos;t show them that slide , because they &apos;re just going to think you &apos;re another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn &apos;t do much .
but that care means also you learn .
and before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world .
i work with t@@ w@@ y@@ la th@@ ar@@ p a lot , and i work with mark mor@@ ris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
this is traject@@ ories going to mars ; all this was done by hand with slide rules .
it &apos;s actually from y@@ it@@ z@@ ha@@ k r@@ ab@@ in .
now if you think about it , if i to@@ s@@ sed a co@@ in a hundred times , and i &apos;m allowed to with@@ hold from you the answers half the times , then i can convince you that i have a co@@ in with two heads .
look at africa &apos;s beg@@ g@@ ing-@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
so you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent gro@@ wn and you didn &apos;t know that it was going to grow up to a cas@@ so@@ war@@ y , you would think they were two different animals .
you can wear a pair of head@@ phones that are connected to it wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly , and when you touch it , you can hear the music that &apos;s described on the top , which is something you can &apos;t read .
they allow us to go where we want to when we want to .
it was about 1960 .
but he didn &apos;t have wikipedia .
ni@@ geri@@ an new@@ spa@@ pers circu@@ lations spi@@ ked .
and per@@ ry &apos;s policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pra@@ y for rain .
tom ot@@ ter@@ ness contribu@@ ted , ma@@ ir@@ a kal@@ man contribu@@ ted and it became this ca@@ th@@ arti@@ c experience for us .
you may know one line of it , it says , &quot; i &apos;ll never leave a fallen com@@ ra@@ de to fall into the hands of the enemy . &quot;
my fo@@ ster father &apos;s small act of love re@@ minded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ gry , even if he was star@@ ving .
this might be what we end up with .
here are the robots that they inspi@@ re , the me@@ cho@@ -@@ geck@@ os from i@@ robot .
and i organi@@ ze it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negoti@@ ation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s concep@@ tu@@ al world , the world of ideas , the world of as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , of in@@ ventions , with the relationship of the ex@@ teri@@ or world and all the limit@@ ations , the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers .
and finally , we need to really re@@ ward politi@@ cians .
and if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 sc@@ ales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a tur@@ tle , or to@@ es .
they were terri@@ fied of polio , and it would cause public pan@@ ic .
that hasn &apos;t changed in over 150 years .
ka@@ vit@@ a ra@@ m@@ das : radi@@ cal women , embra@@ cing tradition
and this is because we &apos;re all constantly she@@ dding microbes .
and didn &apos;t that feel good ?
but it was a film that star@@ red char@@ li@@ ze ther@@ on and it was about women &apos;s rights , women &apos;s em@@ power@@ ment , dom@@ esti@@ c violence and so on .
but price to ent@@ ry into that competition would be , you could just , say , use the president &apos;s goal .
and this network of relations is ever@@ -@@ evol@@ ving .
it felt as val@@ id perhaps even as american culture .
in the age of glob@@ alization , we moved on .
so we &apos;re all back home .
&quot; there &apos;s one thing more -- there &apos;s just one more thing you better understand .
and it has real beauty and real explan@@ at@@ ory power .
so , it turns out the street is a ne@@ ver@@ -@@ en@@ ding source of inspiration for us .
for i never had an in@@ kl@@ ing that perhaps the things i do might some@@ day , somehow thre@@ aten you .
in this image of the to@@ k@@ yo sky@@ line , i &apos;ve hid@@ den data from the ne@@ west planet@@ -@@ hun@@ ting space telescope on the block , the ke@@ pl@@ er mission .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s all right , you can dete@@ ct radio waves from the sun , but the sun is the only object in the universe that &apos;s close enough and bright enough actually to be dete@@ ct@@ able . you can easily calculate that radio waves from the sun are fair@@ ly fa@@ in@@ t , and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away , so it certainly will not be dete@@ ct@@ able .
se@@ ba@@ stian : draw thy s@@ word .
that acci@@ dents , that lou@@ is ka@@ hn , who talked about acci@@ dents , this is another quality of the trick@@ ster .
my fre@@ el@@ ance job ended . and i had to get a ful@@ l-@@ time job to pay the bil@@ ls .
these pictures are of a violent or sexual nature .
there &apos;s no choice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ eness cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you .
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototyp@@ e , it &apos;s gone from an idea to a real laptop .
the goal is to protect bio@@ diversity , to provide st@@ ability and res@@ ili@@ ence .
so the fla@@ ws are the key .
so what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery ?
it &apos;s not giving me my last two pi@@ es . i &apos;m going to give up .
now to understand how con@@ gress came to write a bill that won &apos;t ac@@ comp@@ lish its st@@ ated goals , but will produce a lot of per@@ ni@@ cious side effects , you have to understand a little bit about the back story .
and that became the inter@@ face plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
first they don &apos;t grow .
this was an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any . we came to understand and to prove that the brown co@@ ating that we see today was not done by leon@@ ardo da vin@@ ci , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
so you can click on things and re@@ move it .
we can &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in -- let alone an inse@@ ct &apos;s -- another human being &apos;s mind .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
and if you look at the name of one of those streets , bread street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
un@@ aids tell us that the hiv rate in z@@ ambi@@ a is 20 percent , and mortality esti@@ mates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
it glo@@ ws from within , it &apos;s trans@@ lu@@ cent .
now i am going to speak to you about my movie .
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
even the sha@@ do@@ w on the ball becomes its own object .
and what the dna sequen@@ cing technologies are allo@@ wing people to do now is do deta@@ iled studies of , say , 100 patients who have cro@@ hn &apos;s disease and 100 people who don &apos;t have cro@@ hn &apos;s disease .
next satur@@ day , set a day asi@@ de , design yourself a beautiful day , and use sa@@ vor@@ ing and min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness to en@@ h@@ ance those pleas@@ ures .
wealth is ri@@ pped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called un@@ productive .
i had no idea i would have a ph@@ .@@ d .
the adv@@ ent of the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ dness and of the wea@@ po@@ ns of mass destruction means that , increasingly , i share a dest@@ iny with my enemy .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
you &apos;re done , and you celebrate .
and of course fen@@ ces around the world are all car@@ tes@@ ian , all stri@@ ctly linear .
which led one scientist to de@@ cl@@ are that al@@ tru@@ i@@ stic pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment may be the gl@@ ue that holds societies together .
but that was not the end of the story .
i said , people should know about this book .
most of the works have no ti@@ tle , unti@@ t@@ led .
but i do want to introduce you to a couple of fol@@ ks you may recognize , if you saw &quot; bridge and tun@@ ne@@ l . &quot;
these easy ideas to complex questions are very appe@@ aling when you are emo@@ tionally vulnerable .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islam@@ ic democracy ?
so , i think de@@ co@@ ding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the u.s. , and maybe ob@@ ama &apos;s rat@@ ings can go up again .
i &apos;m looking for this opportunity to create an ei@@ ff@@ el to@@ wer moment , we call it .
the kni@@ ghts tem@@ pl@@ ar realized very quickly that they couldn &apos;t face the zet@@ as on violence alone , and so they developed a strategy as a social enter@@ prise .
and it &apos;s v@@ ital we understand this .
there were just little art@@ fully plac@@ ed blo@@ bs of paint .
it &apos;s a much bigger piece that i do explor@@ ing the space of a ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric tri@@ angle .
our calcu@@ lation shows that quantum tun@@ n@@ eling of the hig@@ gs field is not likely to occu@@ r in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
so , what your le@@ tter means : i &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political offici@@ als are the pin@@ at@@ as .
now , the ad@@ ded one , apart from this immedi@@ acy , negative , this con@@ cre@@ ten@@ ess , now you have a sense of agency .
but one area which is particularly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing for us is the northern region , you know , of mars , close to the north pole , because we see ice cap@@ s , and we see the ice cap@@ s shr@@ in@@ king and exp@@ and@@ ing , so it &apos;s very much like you have in northern canada .
and also we wanted to free up the e@@ ars , so the sound actually goes through , condu@@ cts straight to the b@@ ones in your cr@@ ani@@ um , which is a little bit fre@@ ak@@ y at first , but you get used to it .
he &apos;s a really important leader , a real vision@@ ary , for@@ war@@ d-@@ thinking man , and he told me two things when i appro@@ ached him .
but yet , it &apos;s the fif@@ th le@@ ading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states .
and finally , it &apos;s a rich la@@ ven@@ der , and after a couple of thousand feet , it &apos;s ink black .
but this was not the case .
but that was one of the reasons .
because for so long i &apos;ve been standing on the si@@ del@@ ines content to be a witness , just taking photographs .
and in fact , what we need to do is see that as ch@@ ap@@ ter one , celebrate it , close it , and recognize that we need a ch@@ ap@@ ter two that is all about execu@@ tion , all about the ho@@ w-@@ to .
blog@@ gers ex@@ posed this , or they worked hard to ex@@ pose this .
the 0@@ .@@ 1 percent in the u.s .
but so did most of the fla@@ g-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers , except sophi@@ a l@@ oren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion .
he believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face , and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be comb@@ ined to create infin@@ ite possi@@ bili@@ ties of everything the human face is capable of doing .
getting a little more technical now .
in a strong interaction , a strong force partic@@ le , such as this one , inter@@ acts with a color@@ ed quar@@ k , such as this green one , to give a quar@@ k with a different color charge -- this red one .
this is what exists in nature . obser@@ vation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day . that &apos;s what i do .
and not only had the support , i found two wonderful part@@ ners in crime in this adv@@ enture .
&quot; ten milli@@ gra@@ m , 20 milli@@ gra@@ m . &quot;

this image of three men wearing gas mas@@ ks was taken in cher@@ no@@ by@@ l origin@@ ally , and i pa@@ sted it in sou@@ thern ital@@ y , where the ma@@ fi@@ a sometimes bur@@ y the g@@ arb@@ age under the ground .
and the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers just take all the to@@ o@@ th@@ pi@@ cks to the ou@@ ter edge of the nest mo@@ und and leave them there .

you &apos;re a mother and you &apos;re watching your child , and on day six , you see pu@@ st@@ ul@@ es that become hard .
whether in this audience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing-@@ with@@ -@@ rage thing , after as well , some of them .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ process@@ or .
and i think that &apos;s also part of life .
so imagine your kid &apos;s al@@ ge@@ bra text@@ book in sev@@ ent@@ h grade .
he loved kni@@ tting .
thanks .
and i felt a little bit che@@ ated , because the visu@@ alization -- that &apos;s a really easy thing to do .
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
so in addition to doing the transplant , we had to find out how to get a bac@@ teri@@ al chromo@@ some out of the eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tic ye@@ ast into a form where we could transplant it into a reci@@ pi@@ ent cell .
i had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several ma@@ ster@@ pieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to as@@ s@@ ess , for example , the state of conser@@ vation . see here the face of the ma@@ don@@ na of the chair that when just sh@@ ining a u@@ v light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , i should rather say .
and this effect is very pleas@@ ant on the mind , and it hel@@ ps the sent@@ ence to feel right .
so if you zo@@ om in on this genome , then what you see , of course , is this double heli@@ x structure -- the code of life sp@@ ell@@ ed out with these four bio@@ chemical letters , or we call them bas@@ es , right : a , c , g and t .
boat got a bit din@@ ged up , so did i .
the difference between knowing information of what you &apos;re going to do personally , and not knowing information , can save your life , and it could mean the difference between 1@@ 50,000 to 200@@ ,000 fat@@ alities and half a million to 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 fat@@ alities .
he goes down and he me@@ ets this famous angl@@ er@@ fish .
no , he never saw this .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which -- there hasn &apos;t been any enthusias@@ m for ad@@ option precisely because people are so en@@ am@@ ored with the current car seat solution . ok .
let &apos;s increase the web@@ sites that they cra@@ w@@ l from 20,000 to 20 million .
there is a ras@@ h of suici@@ de in china .
when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still dis@@ agree with us , then we move on to a second assu@@ mption , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots .
s@@ ally : &quot; for this summer program at ny@@ u . &quot;
this was my medical k@@ it .
first of all , it &apos;s going to be a theory about memory .
i couldn &apos;t find a teacher . what i did find was a friend that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -year-old girl who was an accoun@@ t@@ ant and she played with them all the time .
now , here &apos;s another little secret i &apos;m going to tell you about : for the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems .
let me zo@@ om in .
we started experiment@@ ing , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . the scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . it &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . and we supply the con@@ ran shops , and don@@ na kar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
and sometimes you &apos;re equi@@ pped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable crea@@ tivity .
but we &apos;ve still got problems .
i &apos;ll get a lon@@ ely , little sent@@ ence with real error in it , &quot; yeah , i guess i could come inside , but only for a minute . &quot;
we built eng@@ ines -- so we built 100 different eng@@ ines over the last two years .
our need for connection , our need for separ@@ at@@ eness , or our need for security and adv@@ enture , or our need for toge@@ th@@ ern@@ ess and for autonom@@ y , and if you think about the little kid who si@@ ts on your la@@ p and who is co@@ zi@@ ly ne@@ sted here and very se@@ cure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to disco@@ ver and to expl@@ ore .
so i want you to imagine that these nine bis@@ cu@@ its that i found in the bin repres@@ ent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
i was a sur@@ gi@@ cal resi@@ dent at the john@@ s hopkins hospital , taking emer@@ gen@@ cy call .
what he understood was that biological diversity -- cro@@ p diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture .
these are all ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations , s@@ light ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations of a fundamental truth , which is port@@ lan@@ ders spend a lot more on re@@ creation of all kinds than the rest of america .
and so thinking about the models that we &apos;ve just disc@@ us@@ sed , you can see , going forward , that tissue engineering is actually po@@ is@@ ed to help revolutionize drug scre@@ ening at every single step of the path : disease models making for better drug for@@ mu@@ lations , mas@@ si@@ vely parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing , reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical tri@@ als , and individu@@ alized therap@@ ies that dis@@ ru@@ pt what we even consider to be a market at all .
at the end of the day , you can dis@@ agree with the discussion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
that was why i put it as a single point up there .
and hon@@ est@@ ly , where we &apos;ve gone through over the last 11 years , through an attemp@@ t to find ways of turning circu@@ its and cells and parts and pa@@ th@@ ways of the brain on and off , both to understand the science and also to con@@ front some of the issues that face us all as humans .
i took up the gun -- not to shoot , not to kill , not to destroy , but to stop those who would do evil , to protect the vulnerable , to de@@ fend democra@@ tic values , to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in am@@ ster@@ da@@ m about how we can make the world a better place .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
he was kind of a g@@ am@@ bl@@ er type -- and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able , therefore -- and took his fru@@ stra@@ tions out on her .
now when i was in si@@ x@@ th grade , the public funding all but elimin@@ ated the arts budgets in the wor@@ c@@ ester public school system .
this cont@@ ing@@ ent seems to be quite lucky , and it has not susta@@ ined any casu@@ al@@ ties , even though do@@ zens of peac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers have been killed in liber@@ ia .
and she used to go nuts , every five minutes or so in the play , and he said to her , &quot; we must have a word to bring you back to reality , and the word , my de@@ ar , will be &apos; bas@@ ing@@ stoke . &apos; &quot; so every time she got a little nuts , he would say , &quot; bas@@ ing@@ stoke ! &quot; and she would say , &quot; bas@@ ing@@ stoke , it is . &quot; and she would be fine for a little while .
nin@@ ety percent of women don &apos;t , and 95 percent of women don &apos;t know that it incre@@ ases your breast cancer risk .
let &apos;s say you &apos;re in love . all right ?
but first , i would like to take you back to this event : the collap@@ se of commun@@ ism .
the two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
for eight years , she walked through the ri@@ ft valley .
we have to figure out how to re@@ wi@@ re the systems that we have .
one way to imagine that is i ga@@ ther large dat@@ as@@ ets from around the world .
there are a lot of really ne@@ at , very good robotic hands out there in the market .
maybe i can cut there , see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i &apos;m reporting back . i &apos;m reporting back simply to say that when i left the children &apos;s home i had two things that i wanted to do . one was to find my family , and the other was to write po@@ e@@ try .
it was a really very stres@@ s@@ ful time .
we can call this place in con@@ go a death camp , because those who are not killed will die of disease or star@@ vation .
and what i really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving towards a collabor@@ ative society , a society in which the tal@@ ents of both men and women are becoming understood and valu@@ ed and emplo@@ yed .
i &apos;ve been up to its front gates .
we pil@@ oted the work in the u.s. and the u.k. and japan and australi@@ a , and now i &apos;m pleas@@ ed to report that the united states patent office will be roll@@ ing out universal , complete , and total op@@ en@@ ness , so that all patent appli@@ cations will now be open for citi@@ zen particip@@ ation , beginning this year .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the cham@@ ps-@@ el@@ y@@ sees .
and they said , let &apos;s measure co2 per hou@@ se@@ hold , and when they did that , the maps just fli@@ pped , cool@@ est in the center city , war@@ mer in the sub@@ ur@@ bs , and red hot in these ex@@ urban &quot; drive ti@@ ll you quali@@ fy &quot; neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods .
and the second imp@@ lication is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequence , become increasingly un@@ familiar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experi@@ ences and hi@@ stories that we are not really familiar with , or conver@@ s@@ ant with .
there &apos;s also mur@@ mur@@ s , mon@@ tage , mo@@ bs , metri@@ cs and mo@@ unds .
and instead of waiting for chemical re@@ actions to take place , it uses light .
for that , we use an ini@@ tial measu@@ re@@ ment un@@ it .
and if you want , you can la@@ y color in the m@@ old , and get rid of the paint shop .
we can look inside with real time f@@ mr@@ i -- in the brain at real time .
but the thing was , i wrote this , and my friends read it , and they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , that men@@ a , she wrote a post about , you know , w@@ ant@@ ing a stupid thing and being stupid . &quot;
so it &apos;s the demand that brings them to the table .
but some countries re@@ main back in this area here .
so we asked the go@@ ose to do it again , and hop@@ ed she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
with a du@@ sty back@@ ho@@ e , a hand@@ ful of japanese paint mark@@ ers and a few students in to@@ w , de@@ bor@@ ah gor@@ don di@@ gs up ant col@@ on@@ ies in the ari@@ zona desert to understand their complex social system .

now , sand is a ma@@ gi@@ cal material of beautiful con@@ tradi@@ ctions .
i mean , it &apos;s just a losing pro@@ position .
you know , simple words lost in the quick@@ sand of experience .
so j@@ ul@@ ie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her as@@ th@@ ma .
but the unless word is also atta@@ ched to that other , most terri@@ fying phrase , &quot; if only i had ... &quot; &quot; if only i had ... &quot; if you ever have that thought ri@@ co@@ ch@@ eting in your brain , it will hurt a lot .
that is a pretty soli@@ d contribu@@ tion for a behavior equ@@ ated with doing nothing .
it &apos;s not just what you ex@@ clu@@ de from your diet , but also what you inclu@@ de that &apos;s prote@@ ctive .
hal@@ ved . hal@@ ved .
so i said , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re all in this yourself . you teach : it &apos;s gener@@ osity , &quot; was all i could think of . what is virtu@@ e ?
and i say believe because this process is still on@@ going .
now , she is ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to me , and i am so close to her , and you think , maybe she can see you , maybe she can hear you .
the hard part is , what do i do with all this attention ?
there are a lot of people who are frustrated . &quot;
and i find that very interesting and very pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive , because what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different dire@@ ctions : dire@@ ctions that are specific and unique to problems .
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .
well in our research , we &apos;ve found that these changes are gro@@ unded fundamentally in the uni@@ qu@@ ely human ability to monit@@ or time -- not just clock time and calendar time , but life@@ time .
to start thinking about saying , &quot; let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot;
and we all look forward to those things .
and so was darwin .
this defin@@ es a person@@ alized electro@@ chemical neuro@@ pro@@ s@@ thesis that will enable lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion during training with a new@@ ly designed sup@@ porting system .
so what if i don &apos;t let people sum@@ mar@@ ize individual ted@@ talks to six words , but give them 10 ted@@ talks at the same time and say , &quot; please do a six-@@ word sum@@ mary for that one . &quot;
and i said , &quot; char@@ lot@@ te , it sounds pretty interesting to me . &quot;
and arth@@ ur was looking at this old book , and he said , &quot; well , that was wrong .
ad@@ ult mal@@ es : a huge lo@@ ad .
maybe that &apos;s because you don &apos;t actually have ac@@ ne .
traditional lab tests for disease diagno@@ sis can be too expensive and cum@@ ber@@ some for the regi@@ ons most in need . george wh@@ it@@ es@@ i@@ des &apos; in@@ gen@@ ious answer is a fo@@ ol@@ proof tool that can be manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red at virtu@@ ally zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i &apos;m not going to change those ti@@ les at all , but i &apos;m going to reve@@ al the rest of the scene and see what happens to your per@@ ception .
it takes a long , long time to make these sc@@ or@@ es , and right now i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 1@@ 80 pages in leng@@ th , and it &apos;s just a big ch@@ unk of my life , and i &apos;m just pul@@ ling out hair .
as oil pri@@ ces go up , energy pat@@ ents go up .
and i went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to pre@@ p@@ are a project for us , and we started . we started to plant , and this first year we lost a lot of trees , second year less , and slowly , slowly this dead land started to be born again .
you go into the b@@ ars in sar@@ din@@ ia , instead of seeing the spor@@ ts illu@@ strated swi@@ m@@ suit calendar , you see the cent@@ en@@ arian of the month calendar .
and there is a lake scene in the south pol@@ ar region of ti@@ tan .
but the principle of universal darwin@@ ism is that any information that is vari@@ ed and sele@@ cted will produce design .
and i &apos;m going to show you a small sa@@ mp@@ le of this , but there &apos;s really a theore@@ tical reason why technology develop@@ s in an exponenti@@ al fashi@@ on .
now this is a little pu@@ mp with which you could inf@@ late a balloon .
dan co@@ b@@ ley : what physics taught me about mark@@ eting
so , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
it &apos;s said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to f@@ und 9 / 11 actually passed through the institutions of the twin to@@ wers which 9 / 11 destro@@ yed .

another traditional use@@ ful@@ ness of older people is that they are capable of baby@@ sitting their grand@@ children , there@@ by fre@@ eing up their own ad@@ ult children , the parents of those grand@@ children , to go hun@@ ting and ga@@ ther@@ ing food for the grand@@ children .
we &apos;ve heard all about this here this week , so i won &apos;t say too much more than that , other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies .
but our multi@@ tas@@ king reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
but a huge difference between afghanistan and s@@ r@@ i lan@@ ka .
metaph@@ or matters because it creates expec@@ tations .
i &apos;m a biolog@@ ist , and the central theor@@ em of our subject : the theory of design , darwin &apos;s theory of evolution by natural sele@@ ction .
i didn &apos;t know what was going on , but i was so part of the process of getting that out .
you &apos;re not going to hear from alien ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als .
so here are some of the results that i recei@@ ved . i think they &apos;re quite nice .
in this so@@ aring demonstration , dea@@ f per@@ c@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ev@@ el@@ yn gl@@ en@@ nie illu@@ str@@ ates how listening to music invol@@ ves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your ear@@ dru@@ ms .

so i sold lots and lots of sun@@ glas@@ ses .
he did a lot of this work in the &apos; 60s , and so a lot of this lo@@ gic theory la@@ y fal@@ low as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it &apos;s now coming back .
now , i went one step further and said , &quot; why do we have to stick with the sto@@ d@@ gy law@@ yers and just have a paper docum@@ ent ? let &apos;s go online . &quot;
and we &apos;re announ@@ cing a new product here ton@@ ight , which is the first time this has ever been shown in public .
so the problems of be@@ es today isn &apos;t necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don &apos;t really notice are these problems in cities .
and all of this goes back to the failure of the d@@ m@@ ca to dis@@ allow sharing as a technical means .
if i ask you to think of their narra@@ tives -- the west being at war with islam , the need to de@@ fend islam against the west -- these narra@@ tives , they come to your mind immediately .
self-@@ discipl@@ ine : the most important factor for success .
then over the late &apos; 4@@ 0s , &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s , &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s , waves of de@@ col@@ oni@@ zation took place .
and this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that r &amp; amp ; d-@@ i@@ -@@ y has moved beyond just window far@@ ms and le@@ ds into solar pan@@ els and a@@ qu@@ apo@@ ni@@ c systems .
other@@ wise you &apos;re in trouble .
e@@ ye@@ witness news reporter st@@ acy sa@@ ger ton@@ ight , with a small and port@@ able machine that literally z@@ aps your migra@@ ines away .

so , now it &apos;s time to put it all together and design the ultimate tedtalk .
so you start to hear these ab@@ u@@ sive voices , but you don &apos;t hear one ab@@ u@@ sive voice , you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 ab@@ u@@ sive voices , like if the de@@ vil had tou@@ re@@ tte &apos;s , that &apos;s what it would sound like .

it &apos;s less n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty than it sounds .
i was at the top of the general assem@@ bly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
i felt like i was a ves@@ sel of the future of humanity .
but the last two needs -- the first four needs are called the needs of the person@@ alities , is what i call it -- the last two are the needs of the spirit .
and then you might come up with something like this .
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we atta@@ ched to that ?
i never thought i would be able to casu@@ ally move around a campus like brown on my own .
there &apos;s a study some of you think you know about , but very few people have ever read the story . you watched the movie .
and i was born without my left hand -- right hand .

just two things .
so , we actually -- i showed that , at a conference , to president ab@@ du@@ l kal@@ am , at that time , and then he said , &quot; ok , we should use this in b@@ hab@@ ha atom@@ ic research cent@@ re for some use of that . &quot;
every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him .
but to do that , you need the permanent den@@ ti@@ tion , which you don &apos;t see here , because what you have here are the baby teeth .
all these things are important for development , especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards wel@@ f@@ are .
and we make cells dance .
it &apos;s probably why i &apos;m a little bit pan@@ i@@ cked right now -- other than all the c@@ aff@@ eine that i &apos;ve had and the sugar -- but this is really cre@@ ep@@ y for an entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r .
he suggest@@ ed that dimensions might come in two v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties -- there might be big , eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , cur@@ le@@ d-@@ up dimensions , cur@@ led up so small , even though they &apos;re all around us , that we don &apos;t see them .
nearly 450 million people are affected by mental illness worldwide . in weal@@ thy nations , just half recei@@ ve appropri@@ ate care , but in developing countries , close to 90 percent go un@@ treated because psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ sts are in such short supply . vi@@ kra@@ m pat@@ el out@@ lines a highly promis@@ ing approach -- training members of communities to give mental health inter@@ ventions , em@@ power@@ ing ordinary people to care for others .
it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then deli@@ vered to me .
we do more vision more hours of the day than we do anything else .
and now to introduce their music video , we have ok go .
as i speak now , they are before the cour@@ ts .
that this woman is in england , and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing .
which sugge@@ sts that instead of there being an in@@ na@@ te sense of fair@@ ness , that somehow the basis of our economic tran@@ sa@@ ctions can be influ@@ enced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
that &apos;s essentially a guaran@@ tee of what the l@@ h@@ c will find .
and on one occasi@@ on when we were up in mal@@ in head up in don@@ egal , a shark s@@ ma@@ cked the side of the boat with his tail , more , i think , in star@@ tle to the fact that a boat came near it , rather than the tag going in .
now let &apos;s look at another region , the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
because we think that we can give that pur@@ pose and that community and that self-@@ worth back to the ve@@ ter@@ an .
we did it with 150 comb@@ at casu@@ al@@ ties in six weeks .
this is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the national research coun@@ cil in the united states , wher@@ ein they tried to understand how we can look for life el@@ se@@ where in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
the compon@@ ents of this material are just water and protein .
we emer@@ ge out of relationships , and we are deeply inter@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated , one with another .

if you want to know what technology is going to change the world , don &apos;t pay attention to 13@@ -year-old bo@@ ys -- pay attention to young mothers , because they have got not an o@@ un@@ ce of support for technology that doesn &apos;t materi@@ ally make their lives better .
so i had always thought , you know , &quot; you change your mind , and you change your behavior , &quot; but it &apos;s often the other way around .

a third of the people we passed the she@@ et , they gave it back to us .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dr@@ y season .
this shows you , for text that many people are edi@@ ting , when a change was made , who made it , and what the change is .
i was working in the cen@@ ters for disease control , and i had a lot more hair back then as well .

you can &apos;t really dis@@ pu@@ te what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a prof@@ ession when we actually get to see this .

if you increase the speed of each of these ro@@ tors , then the robot flies up , it ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ates up .

so it means that you can actually em@@ bed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of exten@@ d@@ able ideas into really simple devices .
i@@ dr@@ is p@@ aus@@ es , then he moves again , and fr@@ aser says , &quot; please !
and so we can control that with micro@@ -@@ controll@@ ers and create a fully volu@@ metri@@ c , three-@@ dimensional display with just 25@@ 6 le@@ ds .
we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war .
a week later , the patient would come back for a follo@@ w-@@ up exam@@ ination .
they did chicken po@@ t p@@ ie , they did fri@@ ed chicken , and then they finally introdu@@ ced chicken mc@@ nug@@ gets .
this is a scene from star wars where the 3@@ p@@ o comes out and he sees machines making machines . how de@@ pra@@ ved !
we all have to improve on this sort of thing .
i &apos;m gon@@ na sing this song , just to inspi@@ re you how this woman has made a difference .
jo@@ han rock@@ strom : let the environment gui@@ de our development
ma@@ kers are in control .
and the child was sent to a fo@@ ster home for three days .
over time , they will contribu@@ te to african development and to science in ways we can only imagine .
an identity was defined pri@@ mar@@ ily by religion .
because life is complex , and here is the har@@ dest and biggest change : we have to restore the auth@@ ority to ju@@ d@@ ges and offici@@ als to interpre@@ t and apply the law .
and that moved us to the next level .
jac@@ qu@@ eline no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz appl@@ au@@ ds the world &apos;s hei@@ ghten@@ ed interest in africa and poverty , but argu@@ es per@@ su@@ asi@@ vely for a new approach .
and i suddenly realized something : that i was completely in the dark .
as early as 2001 , we asked arab@@ s , and muslims in general around the world , what they ad@@ mi@@ red most about the west .
k@@ bi : i &apos;m just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won &apos;t affect my face -- the explosion , you know .
and so that was the idea .
i became ti@@ m@@ ely .
so you have these people aging , and now this is them today , or last year , and that &apos;s a powerful thing to have , to be able to tra@@ ck this .
so the arro@@ ws connect regi@@ ons that are active at the same time , and the direction of the arro@@ ws flo@@ ws from the region that &apos;s active first in time , and the arro@@ whe@@ ad goes to the region that &apos;s active later .
president roo@@ sev@@ elt , he said , &quot; believe you can , and you are hal@@ f@@ way there . &quot;
but the gene@@ tic@@ ist professor steve j@@ ones descri@@ bes how uni@@ le@@ ver actually did solve this problem -- trial and error , variation and sele@@ ction .
rb : well , i think that there &apos;s a very thin divi@@ ding line between success and failure .
this equ@@ ation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
i op@@ t for very simple line dra@@ wings -- kind of stupid looking .
it &apos;s the entire population of the united states .
i teach chemistry .
for example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car licen@@ se plates and stuff like that .
i &apos;m fascin@@ ated with the idea of what happens when you mer@@ ge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
to conclu@@ de , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about r@@ ats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
the european union , same thing .
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?
you never finished that m@@ ba . your wife left you .
but all of the u@@ v@@ b , or nearly all of it , is dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated through the th@@ i@@ ck@@ ness of the atmosphere .
in the course of taking my film to villa@@ ges in the west bank , in ga@@ za and in east jer@@ us@@ alem , i have seen the impact that even one docum@@ ent@@ ary film can have in influ@@ encing the transformation .
it was a lot of anger , in@@ san@@ e hum@@ or , a lot of attention , ou@@ trage .
now , our compassion is supposed to be put in action .
and that &apos;s boring , but is it as boring as having to use a con@@ dom every time you have sex , no matter how dr@@ unk you are , no matter how many po@@ p@@ pers you &apos;ve taken , whatever ?
or at least , they shouldn &apos;t if they &apos;re interested in re@@ producing . that -- is not the way any human being spe@@ a@@ ks casu@@ ally .
from the moment of birth , the baby respon@@ ds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother .
and then they bl@@ ame the ban@@ ks for being the bad guys who gave them the mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages .
and from these bedro@@ oms and living rooms and gar@@ ages , with cheap web@@ cam@@ s , lies the world &apos;s great dan@@ cers of tomorrow .
now , these ideas and these events allow us even to de@@ constru@@ ct icon@@ ic places that many of you have been to , like mach@@ u pic@@ ch@@ u .
and there are only two vehi@@ cles in india -- one real , one scri@@ p@@ ted .
a be@@ ef@@ al@@ o is a bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o-@@ cat@@ tle hybri@@ d .
in africa , cor@@ n is one of the main fo@@ ods in many places .
somebody said , &quot; you have to listen to this . &quot;
the blue whale , the biggest cre@@ ature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
what are they doing right ?
i &apos;ve been privile@@ ged to see so much of our beautiful earth and the people and creatures that live on it .

well , con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations , you guys are the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral members of the asteroi@@ ds clu@@ b , which is a clu@@ b for all americans who are willing to ad@@ mit that the other side actually might have a point .
the last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance . &quot;
but also the key is that it &apos;s found in the earli@@ est st@@ ages of the disease , when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival .
girl 2 : i think we -- the reasons , one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because no@@ wadays , like , we have tv shows on the computer .
i looked out the windows and i saw a full half-@@ circle of explosion .
in 2003 , everyone that the united states sent to space was killed .
thank you very much . thank you . thank you .
they are often ignor@@ ed because they &apos;re harder to help .
let &apos;s get her going .
our fe@@ ars pro@@ vo@@ ke in us a very similar form of su@@ spen@@ se .
bor@@ ges said that &quot; nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . &quot;
does god order each moment ? does the wind and the waves o@@ be@@ y him ?
in &quot; the 99 , &quot; na@@ if al-@@ muta@@ wa &apos;s new generation of com@@ ic book heroes fight more than crime -- they s@@ ma@@ sh ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es and battle extre@@ mis@@ m . named after the 99 attribu@@ tes of al@@ la@@ h , his characters rein@@ force positive messa@@ ges of islam and cross cultures to create a new moral fra@@ me@@ work for con@@ fron@@ ting evil , even team@@ ing up with the justi@@ ce leagu@@ e of america .
and that is , there is a sudden emer@@ gen@@ ce and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shel@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpre@@ t that person &apos;s behavior .
must is my favorite word there .
but look here . instead of blo@@ wing tan@@ ks and coming up slowly without thinking about it , it &apos;s a little bit of back pressure , and that su@@ b just comes straight back up out of the water .
and so i guess , one , the gut re@@ actions a little bit wrong sometimes , and two , it does not look like as expected .
you can probably remember ti@@ bur@@ on , it used to look like this .
and there &apos;s four key ingredients to descri@@ bing that .
and i said , &quot; s@@ hal@@ low affect : an in@@ ability to experience a range of emotions . &quot;
in fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clo@@ th@@ es and our hair than we — okay , maybe not our hair , but you see where i &apos;m going .
if its pur@@ pose is more important than the act of doing it , it &apos;s probably not play .
now , when i talk about this , people often tell me , &quot; well , isn &apos;t blank the answer ? &quot; -- organic food , local food , g@@ mo@@ s , new trade sub@@ si@@ dies , new farm bil@@ ls -- and yeah , we have a lot of good ideas here , but not any one of these is a sil@@ ver bul@@ let .
i &apos;m a blog@@ ger , which , probably to a lot of you , means different things .
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a cur@@ ved surface ?
and we knew it was big because , you know , if you just put a next to t and g next to c , you have a cop@@ ying mechan@@ ism .
please , i just want to wake up , it &apos;s got to be a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are . &quot;
we fight f@@ loo@@ ds , tro@@ pic@@ al ra@@ ins at this time of the year .
computer programs are essentially trees , and when you make art with a computer program , there &apos;s kind of a problem .
that challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways , and i think wood is going to be part of that solution , and i &apos;m going to tell you the story of why .
this is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their re@@ venue versus their age -- all zo@@ om@@ ing away , and everybody making millions and billions of dollars .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
yes ? raise your hand if you got that . yes ?
and this is the project today , 12 years old , still in best condition .
why do we all follow the line in the street ?
they started going to the cri@@ cket to watch sha@@ h ru@@ k@@ h k@@ han .
the first thing i &apos;m going to tell you about this mam@@ mal is that it is essen@@ tial for our eco@@ systems to function corre@@ ctly .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamentally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
a girl whose mother had been a prostit@@ ute , and she was a prostit@@ ute , and a boy who &apos;d been in and out of ja@@ il .
and when we enter into this century , you &apos;ll find more than half of man@@ kind down here .
let me first show you an experiment@@ al paradigm that is used to demon@@ strate the syn@@ thesis of happiness among reg@@ ular old fol@@ ks . and this isn &apos;t mine .
this is the data that goes with that . incredibly complex .
but ultimately , the world &apos;s the limit here .
the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olymp@@ ic stadium .
if you really studied that you might have some clu@@ es as to what paul li@@ kes to do .
we &apos;re not dead . we &apos;re fine . we &apos;re fine . &quot;
they also totally get the idea that in some inst@@ an@@ ces they can make more cre@@ di@@ ble promis@@ es to long-term investor@@ s -- the kind of investor@@ s who will come build the port , build the roads , in a new city -- they can make more cre@@ di@@ ble promis@@ es if they do it along with a partner nation .
and now we have 70 percent -- since 20 years , it &apos;s the highest rate of separ@@ ation of g@@ arb@@ age in the world .
okay , that was kind of cool .
wow , they don &apos;t do that in gradu@@ ate schools , i don &apos;t think .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
so fil@@ ling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that &apos;s indeed what contemporary art is all about .
b@@ p : i was born old .
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
why should people support their government ?
do you think this sort of thing could really attra@@ ct a student to the school ? &quot;
our team from u@@ c@@ s@@ c has tag@@ ged elephant se@@ als with ta@@ gs that are gl@@ u@@ ed on their heads , that come off when they sl@@ ough .
no , the pione@@ er is the one who allows himself to throw over@@ board a lot of ballast .
and others , like my mother , would say that i get my material from past lives .
i think we should be a bit more willing , perhaps , to look at the beautiful sight of the sun@@ light bur@@ sting out from behind the clouds and go , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s two cat@@ s dancing the sal@@ sa ! &quot;
so , all of a sudden , here i am , gradu@@ ating from high school in 196@@ 9 , and this happens , and we realize that &quot; away &quot; went away .
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the b@@ ase of the food chain , was in@@ gest@@ ing these po@@ ison p@@ ills .
how does that happen ? we want dylan to be able to do that , and using this mantra of motion , dylan actually can do that .
over time , those gas molecules dis@@ solve into your blood and tis@@ su@@ es and start to fill you up .
we &apos;re pa@@ sting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crow@@ ded market .
at that moment i became part of that bio@@ sphere .
and all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wir@@ es are running through .
and that &apos;s it . those are the four jobs of the street trees .
that was the principle . you -- there would be a nuclear con@@ fla@@ gra@@ tion about to hit us , and if you get under your desk , things would be ok .
the same thing happ@@ end . he was the first to top@@ ple during the arab spring .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
we used to have 40 , now they have come down to 30 .
all of these things are happening in pla@@ in sight , and they &apos;re all prote@@ cted by a force field of te@@ di@@ ousness .
but we know what &apos;s going on in these houses , you know .
so amazon went for six years without re@@ turning any profit to investor@@ s , and people had pati@@ ence .
well , this is the steel gu@@ it@@ ar . it &apos;s an americ@@ an@@ -@@ made instrument .
so this whole industry is un@@ sustainable .
and although that was great for the music business at the time , it wasn &apos;t much good for anything else .
a sound came out of my mou@@ th that i &apos;d never heard before : half gro@@ an , half scre@@ am , bar@@ ely human and p@@ ure ter@@ ror .
up until that day , these were the animals that were most common in my life .
so we know lots of different pa@@ th@@ ways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .
ph : how come ?
so why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
currently , tax@@ pa@@ yers spend about 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year sen@@ ding a person to ja@@ il .
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
there &apos;s a lot of research showing that to solve co@@ oper@@ ative problems , it really hel@@ ps .
when i first met cel@@ ine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy , and she was very ill .
but for me , unlike them , in my world , the s@@ late was not clean , and what was written on it was not encoura@@ ging .
for instance , this is another student of mine , susan jack@@ son from australi@@ a , who did work with some of the le@@ ading ath@@ le@@ tes in the world .
we &apos;re going as fast as we can .
you &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
and it came up with 6@@ ,000 different species of products .
so let &apos;s have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let &apos;s make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happ@@ ier .
so how do we do that ?
i tried to be inclu@@ sive , to inclu@@ de the buildings in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood , whether they were buildings i liked or not .
now , when we do brain ima@@ ging , we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games .
so , while the child is playing pon@@ g , we are tracking where they &apos;re looking .
it can be used in interesting ways .
you can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
so this was the birth of v@@ am@@ pi@@ re econom@@ ics .
yet losing , not afraid to fall , if bra@@ vely we have given all . for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his sp@@ an .
and the book of chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les , the book of e@@ z@@ ra in the he@@ bre@@ w scri@@ p@@ tures repor@@ ted in r@@ inging terms .
but it &apos;s imper@@ ative that we listen because it &apos;s un@@ den@@ i@@ able and defini@@ tive .
as you all know , that return from exi@@ le , the second temple , res@@ ha@@ ped ju@@ da@@ ism .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; knowing what i know , why am i not a veget@@ arian ? &quot;
they had all suff@@ ered the same tra@@ ge@@ dy .
the camera is always on .
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justi@@ fy and say , well , my inten@@ tions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
the other one said , &quot; over@@ reaction ! over@@ reaction ! &quot;
there are more neuro@@ mod@@ ul@@ ators that alter , that inn@@ er@@ v@@ ate this structure than actually neurons in the structure , and they &apos;re able to generate a complicated set of patterns .
so somebody says , &quot; d@@ ele@@ te it , please . d@@ ele@@ te it -- it &apos;s not not@@ able . &quot;
and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .
every single one of you has it , because you have the risk factor for it , which is being alive .
they were around me in three dire@@ ctions .
thank you .
we all need to help .
that &apos;s very important because the hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty and preci@@ pit@@ ation tell you whether you &apos;ve got standing po@@ ols of water for the mosquit@@ oes to bre@@ ed .
what might the bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks be ?
i guess the sho@@ es came off when he was hit .
we can now reach those circu@@ its .
and if you look outside africa , you actually find less genetic variation .
and they dep@@ end too much upon history , upon philosoph@@ y , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
you have formul@@ as that long .
what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost .
and so what you &apos;re looking at here in don@@ or one and don@@ or four , which are the ex@@ cep@@ tions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific sub@@ set of cells .
and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago .
ga@@ yle tz@@ e@@ mach le@@ mm@@ on : women entrepreneurs , example not exception
it &apos;s the most important map of all .
i had one for a wri@@ st@@ watch once . 20 pages .
and the goal is that the world be des@@ ir@@ able and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and i think that &apos;s -- in other words , the next generation . i think that &apos;s a goal that we probably all share .
we really like the human being story a lot .
i did not want to re@@ ca@@ p the cr@@ ash with ab@@ ed .
and i shared their bread and their pra@@ yer .
this is the high-@@ tech g@@ ad@@ ge@@ try that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep di@@ ves .
so i would encourage you all to grab some pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , grab some s@@ alt , grab some sugar and start playing .
and she st@@ one@@ wall@@ ed me . it was un@@ believ@@ able .
you know ? where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew aro@@ se from the potential for earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , as well as the potential for climate change ?
and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , which was to think about a new way of appro@@ aching healthcare .
what was that ? was that real ?
high-@@ capacity transpor@@ tation means spending lots and lots of money .
i &apos;ve done my gri@@ ev@@ ing about the loss .
this is not how it works . &quot;
we &apos;re up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that dep@@ th .
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn &apos;t allow them to learn .
so it really makes you realize the on@@ us on parents to have to look at this and regu@@ late this and police this in their own lives and how aston@@ ishing that is .
so we &apos;ve got motor cortex activ@@ ation up there .
sta@@ ying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science .
but what might feel just right for that mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ aged execu@@ tive can be a problem for an adoles@@ cent who needs to develop fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face relationships .
i started learning about the worl@@ d-@@ record hol@@ der .
one woman stra@@ ps her@@ self .
and so they did .
because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in -- our clo@@ thing , our cars , our roads , and everything -- are directly a result .
shake your hands out .
the person you see on the right hand side is paul del@@ on@@ g-@@ minu@@ tu .
now there &apos;s a whole range of different sorts of non-@@ le@@ th@@ al wea@@ po@@ ns , some of which are obviously available now , some of which they &apos;re developing .
photograph@@ er mon@@ i@@ ka bu@@ la@@ j shares powerful , inti@@ mate images of afghanistan -- of home life , of ritu@@ al , of men and women . behind the head@@ lines , what does the world truly know about this place ?
it &apos;s an important less@@ on for kids to understand -- that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpre@@ ted .
and that &apos;s kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
so the question becomes , what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ?
now to be clear , i &apos;m a journalist and not a technolog@@ ist , so what i &apos;d like to do brie@@ fly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
they &apos;re easy to sequence : unlike a human , they , you know , have a thousand , two thousand genes ; we can figure out what they are .
the experience capital in the world of con@@ fer@@ ences .
because that phase of soli@@ d ice la@@ sts for two months and it &apos;s full of cra@@ cks .
thanks very much . it &apos;s been an honor .
now , the importance of this is not the techni@@ que that you &apos;ve seen here .
it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
and this is after two years .
so this is the bit i &apos;m really sc@@ ared of .
ga@@ ya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old , no one really knows , but its top has broken off and it &apos;s been ro@@ tting back now .
the first person to really explain that was thomas ho@@ b@@ bes , who , in 16@@ 5@@ 1 , explained how ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic and lo@@ gic are the same thing , and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial lo@@ gic , you can do it all with ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic .
is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead rela@@ tives ?
because techni@@ cally i &apos;ve got mot@@ ors ; i &apos;ve got whe@@ els -- i &apos;m a motor vehicle .
and you can never replic@@ ate that performance twice .
&quot; now why does it do this , &quot; i hear you ask .
b@@ c : ed@@ l is this im@@ men@@ se , techni@@ cally challenging problem .
that will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is in@@ ev@@ itable in humans , since it &apos;s been post@@ po@@ ned so very effectively in mi@@ ce .
this is the first sk@@ et@@ ch of a high school in po@@ mon@@ a -- well , whatever it is , a model , a concep@@ tu@@ al , kind of idea .
we use c@@ n@@ c to make sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding to train se@@ mi@@ -@@ ep@@ i@@ thetic matter , plants , into a specific geome@@ try that makes a home that we call a fa@@ b tree hab .
keep that in mind .
an early co@@ ast@@ al migra@@ tion along the south coast of asia , leaving africa around 6@@ 0,000 years ago , re@@ aching australi@@ a very rapi@@ dly , by 50,000 years ago .
we know it was that big because of the impact it had and the cr@@ ater it left .
na@@ than and his bo@@ ss saw this , and they could not toler@@ ate it .
we are evolved den@@ i@@ zens of middle world , and that limits what we are capable of imag@@ ining . we find it intui@@ tively easy to gras@@ p ideas like , when a r@@ ab@@ bit moves at the sort of medium vel@@ o@@ city at which r@@ ab@@ bits and other middle world objects move , and h@@ its another middle world object , like a rock , it kno@@ cks itself out .
thank you very much .
the government is un@@ able to take the ris@@ ks requi@@ red to open up this preci@@ ous fron@@ tier .
i got ac@@ c@@ used in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the po@@ pe to pre@@ ach the trin@@ ity and ca@@ tho@@ lic@@ ism in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
and i &apos;m treating you , my inner circle , like you &apos;re the enemy .
i &apos;m in high school . i have no idea .
so les did a fin@@ er study and he found out it came out about 9@@ ,000 .
there was no difference whatsoever . and at the big ban@@ g , what it exp@@ and@@ ed was the potential for difference .
and what we saw was , we saw these vari@@ ations , and then they told us the secre@@ ts , both about the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time , and about the cont@@ ents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original mo@@ tions .
sar@@ ko@@ zy suggest@@ ed that world leaders should stop m@@ yo@@ pic@@ ally foc@@ using on g@@ d@@ p and consider a new index , what some french are call@@ ing a &quot; jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re index . &quot;
unless you &apos;re prepared to get dung under your finger@@ na@@ ils and root through the dung itself , you &apos;ll never see 90 percent of the dung be@@ et@@ le species , because they go directly into the dung , straight down below it , and then they shu@@ ttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make under@@ ground .
education is so essen@@ tial .
you can &apos;t say all a@@ qua@@ tic animals are na@@ ked , because look at the sea ot@@ ter .
it was a landscape with fig@@ ures , se@@ mi@@ -@@ dres@@ sed , drin@@ king wine . there was a nu@@ de woman in the lower fore@@ ground , and on the h@@ ill@@ side in the back , there was a figure of the myth@@ ological god bac@@ ch@@ us , and he said , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
give it up for that .
it can make war seem like tra@@ ge@@ dy or far@@ ce .
and then this happened .
so this is a plant that is mi@@ mi@@ cking the first plant .
inspired by cell di@@ vision , michael h@@ ans@@ me@@ yer wri@@ tes algorithms that design ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of fac@@ ets . no person could dra@@ ft them by hand , but they &apos;re buil@@ d@@ able -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of archite@@ ctural form .
he was at hopkins when he did this , and he &apos;s such a mo@@ dest guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , &quot; i didn &apos;t realize there was another ham s@@ mit@@ h at hopkins . do you know he just won the no@@ bel ? &quot; i mean , that was mom , but anyway , this guy is just a class act . you find him at the ben@@ ch every single day , working on a pi@@ pe@@ tte and building stuff . and one of the things this guy just built are these things .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
fif@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and of those patients , 10 died .
it &apos;s re@@ dol@@ ent of james bond movies and ki@@ pling bal@@ la@@ ds .
obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dig@@ ni@@ fied form than he was back then .
he has access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs .
so they would have to have something like a rep@@ ti@@ lian skin .
but all of these -- well , these were all sort of innovative things that we did that -- you know , we try many , many different things in our company .
let &apos;s start with government data .
and that &apos;s how it works .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it , and then people started st@@ um@@ bl@@ ing on it , and i started getting some comm@@ ents and some letters and all sorts of feedback from ran@@ dom people from around the world .
it &apos;s un@@ believ@@ able .
so you want to s@@ wa@@ p those out with some good , sustain@@ ably harv@@ est@@ ed fish .
and with knowing comes car@@ ing .
their numbers have never re@@ covered .
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot;
it &apos;s a real pleas@@ ure to be here .
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not sl@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
it goes to the nucleus ac@@ cum@@ bens , all the way up to the pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex , orbital fron@@ tal cortex , where decisions are made , high level .
and we took posi@@ tions with them , and it was through those posi@@ tions that we began to take archite@@ ctural mani@@ fe@@ sta@@ tions and we arri@@ ved at a conclusion that none of us , really none of us could ever have conc@@ ei@@ ved of ini@@ tially or individu@@ ally .
you &apos;ve seen them all around , especially these days as rad@@ ars are che@@ ap@@ er .
and those systems could be identifi@@ ed , and they could be grou@@ ped together .
everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , &quot; oh , i could use it for this and this and this . &quot;
there was the fl@@ or@@ ist , and i can understand that , once again , we &apos;re putting pressure on the on@@ t@@ ology of music as we know it conven@@ tionally , but let &apos;s look at one last piece today i &apos;m going to share with you .
today , n@@ el@@ son ot@@ wom@@ a is healthy .
and the things that rel@@ ate to ford enter its or@@ bit and s@@ wir@@ l around it .
or you could actually meet my need .
it is an efficiency measure .
i mil@@ ked co@@ ws every morning , and i had to mil@@ k the same co@@ ws every evening when i came home from school .
and you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
and they form little groups , all fighting with each other , and when i leave , two hours later , most of them are saying about 2 billion people , and they don &apos;t have any clu@@ e about how to get down to 2 billion , nor do i , but i think they &apos;re right and this is a serious problem .
now , when i went to look at the fig@@ ures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , refle@@ cts the growth of the economy .
so what could this mean ?
and that &apos;s an up@@ -@@ close picture of a lot@@ us lea@@ f .
who car@@ es if the ba@@ ke s@@ ale only has five percent over@@ head if it &apos;s tiny ?
75 people volunte@@ ered , took person@@ ality tests .
and if you looked very clo@@ sely , you &apos;d see that people were drawing with pen@@ c@@ ils , and they were pus@@ hing , you know , big rul@@ ers and tri@@ angl@@ es .
apply them to very big dreams .
this is the one laptop per child , the $ 100 laptop .
they have many of the attribu@@ tes of psychop@@ a@@ ths .
so what i did was , i fil@@ med six of my friends and then , using video mapping and video proje@@ ction , i created a video sculp@@ ture , which was these six friends proje@@ cted into j@@ ars .
i got 200 in the first two weeks .
and du@@ e to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are recei@@ ving the life@@ -@@ saving drugs that they need .
and we could go back to those top@@ ics and say , well , what talks are central to those conver@@ sations ?
they have literally beat a path to our door .
and i say , well , i &apos;m going to bring the future back to ris@@ d .
we all have syn@@ es@@ thetic abilities .
the bo@@ s@@ ni@@ an soldi@@ er who gui@@ ded me told me that all of his friends were there now .
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a desk in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent diplom@@ at .
it pro@@ vo@@ ked tears as well as inc@@ isi@@ ve questions about un@@ ar@@ med peac@@ e-@@ keeping forces and the dou@@ ble@@ -@@ de@@ aling of a western society that pi@@ cks its moral fi@@ ghts with com@@ modi@@ ties in mind .
so income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them .
how many hard drives can you fit in an i@@ ke@@ a store ?
we created uni@@ ons .
the total energy im@@ balance now is about six-@@ ten@@ ths of a watt per square meter .
now my point is the small things matter .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the go@@ ose wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
egyp@@ t : from the 16 percent to about 8@@ .@@ 4 percent .
and in@@ ste@@ d@@ d then becomes our mantra .
what you saw after kat@@ r@@ ina is a very good indi@@ cat@@ or of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack .
now , what this , even this brie@@ f debate , brings out is something that many econom@@ ists over@@ look .
whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine .
at least he &apos;ll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation .
it &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ine looks a bit , to most people , like a dog , or maybe like a tiger , because it has stri@@ pes .
now we want those devices , of course , to be de@@ plo@@ yed by those who are in the tren@@ ches , our colleagues , the primary care physi@@ cians , who see every child , and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice , because they have to see so many children .
in fact it really was the cli@@ ents who had to do it .
all but one guy , this guy named mor@@ mon , who managed to survive by hi@@ ding in the wo@@ ods .
but the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking .
do something different . what do you want to be ? &quot;
the third step , follo@@ wing the second step , is to create new mental hab@@ its .
i want to ro@@ b a bank in a film . i want to ro@@ b a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , with a gun , not with a bom@@ b stra@@ pped around me , right .
in fact , there are some countries in sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa where there &apos;s one op@@ t@@ ome@@ tr@@ ist for eight million of the population .
and one of the first , or the easi@@ est , places we can go and expl@@ ore that is to go towards mars .
worst ever , 13 miles in the wrong direction .
he said , &quot; you are beautiful . you have gro@@ wn into a gor@@ geous woman .
why ? because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light , and the left one is still under green light .
if you could make it fun , and make it eight or 10 minutes , you can &apos;t find your car , un@@ -@@ park your car , move your car , re-@@ park your car and go somewhere ; you can &apos;t get to a ca@@ b or a subway .
and as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re rais@@ ed again , all along pro@@ ving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
and we have 26 elephants here , and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants , but our foundation think elephants is focused on bringing elephants into class@@ rooms around the world virtu@@ ally like this and showing people how incredible these animals are .
e : whe@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ ee ! &#91; sp@@ l@@ at &#93; sw : yeah .
i &apos;m going to do what philosop@@ her@@ s do .
and no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water .
in the years follo@@ wing , the other stories i heard about the poor growing up were no more positive .
but i can &apos;t put in an electro@@ de and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
i talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone .
to leave would be failure .
mapping is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ graphy , it &apos;s also about ima@@ gery .
and when i was resear@@ ching pe@@ ar@@ l di@@ vers , i found the world of fre@@ e-@@ di@@ ving .
as soon as i realized this , i investig@@ ated the underlying relationship between four pre@@ valent air pollu@@ tan@@ ts and their affect on the lung health of as@@ th@@ matic patients .
they all happened to be cap@@ tured on film spon@@ taneously , by n@@ h@@ k of japan .
what will happen to societies that are top@@ -@@ hea@@ vy with older people ?
so i sc@@ ra@@ ped the sli@@ me off and i sent it off to aber@@ de@@ en .
things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the out@@ come .
they &apos;re used to thinking of themselves as provi@@ ders , and they can &apos;t seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college .
and the colors here repres@@ ent the motivation behind the money .
look at all the argu@@ ments we have these days over health care , over bon@@ uses and ba@@ il@@ ou@@ ts on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive action and sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marriage .
&quot; will you help be their dad ? &quot;
and we can ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nan@@ o-@@ molecular molecules the same size of dna and proteins , but there &apos;s no carbon in sight .
that &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
they have enough income for three families .
when i &apos;m on my dea@@ th@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
the second school i was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tu@@ li@@ p tree , i think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bu@@ sh@@ es and ve@@ ge@@ tation around it , around the playing fields .
i brought some for her parents .
my work has evolved from being concern@@ ed main@@ ly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well .
it turned out that it wasn &apos;t , that it really is a system of motivation , a system of w@@ ant@@ ing .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sa@@ mp@@ le the oceans is ac@@ ou@@ stics , or sound waves .
i believe in the concept of a ra@@ ja yo@@ g@@ i : be a du@@ de before you can become an as@@ ce@@ tic .
so this is the project . here &apos;s how it started .
really what we want to hear is music .
well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indi@@ visible , un@@ cu@@ tt@@ able const@@ itu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?
and so you have to start with it . you have to focus on it .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about budgets , military budgets , and how the deb@@ ts of countries work out .
&quot; you don &apos;t speak english ? &quot;
and i just love learning and i &apos;m incredibly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive and i love taking on , you know , the status qu@@ o and trying to turn it up@@ side down .
and th@@ us began my life@@ -@@ long passion for writing fi@@ ction .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
when a leader says , &quot; not under my watch , &quot; everything begins to change .
i think there &apos;s an obvious question that i hope you &apos;re thinking about .
he didn &apos;t know .
a vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous model covered in synthetic diam@@ on@@ ds .
but that &apos;s too complicated for today , so i &apos;ll simpli@@ fy it for you , and i give you one average point for each sur@@ v@@ ey .
and that &apos;s what we did .
&quot; everybody gets absolutely fran@@ tic about it , because you &apos;re not allowed to say these things , yet when you look at it ra@@ tionally , there is no reason why those ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to debate as any other , except that we &apos;ve agreed somehow between us that they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; and that &apos;s the end of the quote from dou@@ glas .
and the distribution of japanese is totally different , where we see a group of inter@@ medi@@ ate sounds , which is known as the japanese &quot; r. &quot;
these fol@@ k sing@@ ers met at college at a gender studies program .
wor@@ k-@@ life balance , says ni@@ gel mar@@ sh , is too important to be left in the hands of your emplo@@ yer . mar@@ sh la@@ ys out an ide@@ al day bal@@ an@@ ced between family time , personal time and produ@@ ctivity -- and off@@ ers some stir@@ ring encoura@@ gement to make it happen . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so de@@ ar@@ th of data in the debate is one reason .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ ora .
now the first part , the first problem , is relatively easy -- it &apos;s not easy at all -- but it is something that has been appro@@ ached gradu@@ ally in neuro@@ science .
then there is another couple , there is a brazi@@ lian couple .
this is a klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any flu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spa@@ tial dimensions .
so even though we love publi@@ sh@@ ing as an art , we very much know it &apos;s a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business .
for some , it will lead to anger , religi@@ ous and se@@ ct@@ arian violence and terrorism .
language is something to be me@@ ted out in small ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , you know -- just little h@@ mm , h@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
but when i look towards the future , the next project is completely unknown and wide open .
so what we &apos;re going to do is take an artic@@ ular c@@ arti@@ lage from a young , healthy pig , stri@@ p it of its anti@@ gens , lo@@ ad it with your stem cells , then put it back on to that arth@@ ri@@ tic surface in your k@@ nee , t@@ ack it on there , have you he@@ al that surface and then create a new biologi@@ c surface for your k@@ nee .
rb : i also believe that being a father &apos;s incredibly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , i go on ho@@ li@@ day with them .
these little blue dots are the fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings -- we do this sur@@ v@@ ey every mar@@ ch -- which means that they &apos;re only in the environment from janu@@ ary until mar@@ ch , so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil .
understanding all of this en@@ ables us to shift our per@@ ception of se@@ af@@ o@@ od away from a com@@ modi@@ ty to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people , this is actually a photograph taken in li@@ b@@ ya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people standing outside scre@@ am@@ ing for the elec@@ tions , and when i went out and said , &quot; what is wrong with the inter@@ im pro@@ vin@@ cial coun@@ cil ?
now there are a lot of reasons for that .
this whole finding compassion and common ground with your ene@@ mi@@ es thing is kind of like a poli@@ tic@@ al-@@ spiritual practice for me , and i a@@ in &apos;t the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a .
it &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
&quot; in the name of father abraham , let me offer you some food . &quot;
the technology can also be app@@ lied to real world appli@@ cations -- in this example , a smart home .
he grab@@ bed his pen , he s@@ nat@@ ched his sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s .
given the sta@@ kes , the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the prec@@ au@@ tion@@ ary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irre@@ versi@@ ble , we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certain@@ ty .
by meas@@ uring their student s@@ miles , researchers were able to predict how ful@@ fil@@ ling and long-@@ la@@ sting a subject &apos;s marriage will be , how well she would score on standar@@ di@@ zed tests of well-@@ being and how inspi@@ ring she would be to others .
sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh : can you play a gro@@ om@@ ing song ?
that &apos;s a long way to fall , if you get it wrong . that was just about right .
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get di@@ ab@@ etes .
maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
usually i say no right away , but some of them come with pe@@ di@@ gre@@ e and they sound well-@@ inten@@ tioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings .
you know ?
and what they notic@@ ed was they don &apos;t have a lot of dv@@ rs , they don &apos;t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
so we stra@@ ined it from the ed@@ ges , and we held it by c@@ ables .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
and let &apos;s start at the high level , on the ma@@ cro@@ -@@ fac@@ tors .
and even at this point , i started to move away from the need to replic@@ ate human@@ -@@ ness as the only aes@@ thetic ide@@ al .
people really can learn a language with it .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survi@@ vor@@ s .
with a fli@@ p of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals can &apos;t resi@@ de .
it is easier than you think . it really is .
here &apos;s an example from a variety of con@@ tex@@ ts .
effectively , the taliban create a complete bl@@ ack@@ out of any other source of information for these children .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
again , not an in@@ san@@ e dose , not an illegal dose , but very much at the high end of normal .
lea@@ ven comes from the root word that means en@@ li@@ ven -- to vi@@ vi@@ fy , to bring to life .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
time , nobody can see time .
i believed the photogra@@ pher@@ s , and so did millions of other americans .
when very large stars die , they create temper@@ atures so high that prot@@ ons begin to fu@@ se in all sorts of ex@@ o@@ tic com@@ bin@@ ations , to form all the elements of the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
&quot; okay , &quot; i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a first world country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
the project a@@ im is really quite simple .
it &apos;s going to be hard . i say we give it a shot anyway because we &apos;ve just come too far to scre@@ w it up now .
journalist mis@@ ha gl@@ en@@ ny spent several years in a coura@@ geous investig@@ ation of organi@@ zed crime networks worldwide , which have gro@@ wn to an esti@@ ma@@ ted 15 % of the global economy . from the rus@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a , to giant drug car@@ tel@@ s , his sour@@ ces inclu@@ de not just intelligence and law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement offici@@ als but cri@@ min@@ al insi@@ ders .
simple question : if you can &apos;t read and write , how do you manage your cont@@ act information ?
and he said , &quot; this genetic resour@@ ce , &quot; -- and i &apos;ll never forget the words -- &quot; stands between us and cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c star@@ vation on a scale we cannot imagine . &quot;
so here &apos;s a deep mathematical fact -- if you &apos;ve got two numbers , one of three things must be true .
clouds .
not a lot of other diseases have that profi@@ le . and you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a and egyp@@ t .
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .
but it can con@@ temp@@ late the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ stell@@ ar space .
i &apos;ve put a bunch of examples up here .
it &apos;s lo@@ vely to know they &apos;re concern@@ ed , you know .
the first , obviously , is the world &apos;s free time and tal@@ ents .
and also , i talked to friends about china and chinese internet .
the last thing that &apos;s remarkable about the tarahumara is that all the things that we &apos;re going to be talking about today , all the things that we &apos;re trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve -- things like heart disease and cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and cancer and crime and war@@ f@@ are and violence and clinical depression -- all this stuff , the tarahumara don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
and finally , my son playing in a walking to@@ y by himself .
this has a diam@@ on@@ d-@@ bot@@ tom@@ ed lake .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men of the middle east , here &apos;s a serious issue . when we see each other , when we say h@@ ell@@ o , how many k@@ is@@ ses are we going to do ?
it really would be de@@ di@@ cated to the arts and to inter@@ acting .
my main tool is an underwater video with a hydro@@ phone , which is an underwater micro@@ phone , and this is so i can cor@@ rel@@ ate sound and behavior .
so , what i want to tell you , very brie@@ fly , is a few examples of the exc@@ it@@ ement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at least we believe , that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
but then the next generation of planes sa@@ ves about half .
but one of the first things they needed to do was as@@ s@@ ess what i needed right away .
after a natural dis@@ aster stri@@ kes , there &apos;s only a tiny window of opportunity to r@@ ally effective re@@ co@@ very eff@@ or@@ ts before the world turns their attention el@@ se@@ where . who should be in charge ? when a fre@@ ak tor@@ na@@ do hit their home@@ town , si@@ sters ca@@ it@@ ria and mor@@ gan o &apos;@@ nei@@ ll -- just 20 and 24 at the time -- took the r@@ eins and are now teaching others how to do the same .
and i experienced this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when i traveled to remote villa@@ ges to study poverty .
and the one that particularly bo@@ ther@@ ed me in the bur@@ n department was the process by which the nur@@ ses took the ban@@ da@@ ge off me .
because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consu@@ me this .
and we then can re-@@ per@@ fu@@ se the li@@ ver with cells , pres@@ er@@ ving the blood ves@@ sel tree .
i &apos;d just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing mo@@ vers and sha@@ kers in america . &quot;
when you &apos;re typ@@ ing on your bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , and@@ ro@@ id , iphone , don &apos;t bo@@ ther swit@@ ching la@@ you@@ ts to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation la@@ y@@ out to hit the period and then a space and then try to cap@@ itali@@ ze the next le@@ tter .
but if you look in africa , there is a compon@@ ent of the genetic variation that has no close rela@@ tives outside .
this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible , when we have a team , when we have pione@@ ering spirit , and especially when we understand that all the certain@@ ties we have should be thro@@ wn over@@ board .
some of you guys know paul rand , the greatest graphi@@ c designer -- i &apos;m sorry -- out there .
what are we missing ?
on top of that , those are the places from where trouble comes .
and he would actually say , while he was be@@ ating me , &quot; don &apos;t you cry . don &apos;t you d@@ are cry . &quot;
we for@@ got about the entire chain around us .
and so the idea is , you know , how would you put together the universe in a very simple way ?
you should see small circles -- these are called ves@@ ic@@ les .
heard about it , at least ? you probably hear about genom@@ es these days .
and we do that for a couple of reasons .
now these are some of the questions i had in mind a few years ago when i sat down to write a book .
and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a fin@@ ite resour@@ ce , and increas@@ ed growth is going to push up demand for that .
this is one of the places where planet@@ ary scientists believe there is a highest prob@@ ability of the dete@@ ction of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .
cambridge resear@@ cher au@@ bre@@ y de grey argu@@ es that aging is mer@@ ely a disease -- and a cur@@ able one at that . humans age in seven basic ways , he says , all of which can be a@@ ver@@ ted .
and it specifically re@@ f@@ ers to this guy , gal@@ va@@ o bu@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the lead so@@ c@@ cer comm@@ ent@@ ator for rede glob@@ o .
see , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x childhood that i wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
but enorm@@ ously different mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions here .
the is@@ lands rise only one to two meters above the surface .
our second type of error is a fal@@ se negative .
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integri@@ ty that mean that money will be well spent .
and inside it , right in the middle of this tor@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ al shape , dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ t shape , right in the middle is 150 million degre@@ es .
and instead of using a 100 percent dose , i &apos;m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
here it &apos;s in scot@@ ts@@ d@@ ale , ari@@ zona , and it &apos;s called &quot; flo@@ ating memories . &quot;
these are robert &apos;s m@@ ris , again , under only tt@@ field treatment .
but where is stem cell therapy really going ?
and the answer is , yes , we can , and we did .
but you know , we want , we need some air@@ time for our ideas .
and i think that the answer is , we can look at mortality data , and we can use mortality data to figure out what the pre@@ val@@ ence was in the past .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
we &apos;re curi@@ ous , and we just go out and get knowledge , you know ?
and i think it &apos;s probably in the di@@ ver@@ gent mode that we most need pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness .
somewhere a stream or a ri@@ v@@ u@@ let is running through here .
so in my case , i thought , well , will data and an algorith@@ m lead me to my prin@@ ce char@@ ming ?
michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen .
let &apos;s get off our fan@@ ni@@ es , roll up our sle@@ ev@@ es and get to work , passion@@ ately , in creating an almost perfect world .
and , you know , it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s so important to have like role models out there .
and it is within that region that i &apos;m going to high@@ light now that we have this hou@@ sing of all the life@@ -@@ regu@@ lation devices of the body .
this went down very well in the u.k. , where religion is extremely un@@ popular .
so when i get really depres@@ sed about all of this , i comfort myself in thinking about the industrial revolution .
we also atta@@ ch a dis@@ crete shor@@ t-@@ range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other .
what we see here is a mother in india , and she &apos;s speaking kor@@ o , which is a new@@ ly discovered language .
so i tested them .
let &apos;s re@@ brand global warming , as many of you have suggest@@ ed .
but there are times when we are un@@ willing partici@@ pan@@ ts in de@@ ception .
this is very sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .
if the mon@@ ster wants you , the mon@@ ster &apos;s gon@@ na get you .
so this is telling us that the fer@@ ment@@ ation is in full s@@ wing .
i won &apos;t talk today about re@@ forming the legal system .
but you seem to have more hair .
but there &apos;s to@@ ma@@ to@@ es that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requi@@ re@@ ments of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
and i said , &quot; let me ask you something . &quot;
and they have big cities , and the cities are all depen@@ dent on oil .
we &apos;re a free society , so we let por@@ no@@ graphy and all these things -- we shr@@ u@@ g them off .
i couldn &apos;t walk , i couldn &apos;t talk , i couldn &apos;t eat , i couldn &apos;t move , i certainly couldn &apos;t sing , i couldn &apos;t even brea@@ the , but when i looked up and i saw my mother , i couldn &apos;t help but s@@ mile .
so where do you go in sex ?
the law requ@@ ir@@ es accoun@@ t@@ ability .
we had knowledge about the electro@@ mechan@@ ical efficiency and then we can calculate the a@@ ero@@ dynamic efficiency .
my audience is anyone who is here to listen , even those who are not familiar with classi@@ cal music .
the univers@@ ality , to repe@@ at , is us -- that we are the city .
but then the most amazing thing happens over time .
i like to think that i do a th@@ or@@ ough physical ex@@ am , but because the whole visit was now about the physical , i could do an extra@@ ordin@@ arily th@@ or@@ ough ex@@ am .
so we looked for a universal transl@@ ator ; i thought there would be one out there .
they took one look at the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ine in tasman@@ ia , and they thought , hang on , this is not going to work .
i didn &apos;t expect lo@@ u dan@@ ziger to be here , but this is a building i did for him in 196@@ 4 , i think .
so matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ings .
w@@ k : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
phili@@ p zim@@ bar@@ do : the de@@ mis@@ e of guys ?
one of the challenges is that the ri@@ cher we are , the longer we live .
in fact , i &apos;ve got 3@@ 8@@ ,000 of them now and no kind@@ le in sight .
you &apos;ve got a cool garden to play in and a pon@@ d .
t : i want to speak perfect english .
and it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know .
we actually take the don@@ or li@@ ver , we use very mil@@ d deter@@ g@@ ents , and we , by using these mil@@ d deter@@ g@@ ents , we take all the cells out of the li@@ ver .
and a month after we got the pau@@ ling manus@@ cri@@ pt -- i should say i took the manus@@ cri@@ pt to london , and showed the people .
the united states actually is a country that is the reser@@ ve cur@@ ren@@ cy of the world .
they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed a group of their best scientists to investig@@ ate , and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near venti@@ lation du@@ cts .
and i &apos;m sure bu@@ ck@@ min@@ ster ful@@ ler would be very , very proud to see a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic dom@@ e .
so , i believe the in@@ vention of the computer internet is an in@@ ev@@ itable con@@ sequence of a pre@@ vi@@ ously pro@@ ven , biologi@@ cally successful model .
but this is comb@@ ined with an extremely strong and ubi@@ quit@@ ous state .
so , he had a brilliant idea .
never &quot; hi , jack . &quot;
and they &apos;ll be the same as the symmetries of the tri@@ angle , or the symmetries of the six-@@ poin@@ ted star@@ fish .
they were creating sub@@ si@@ dies either for large far@@ ms , or they were giving in@@ puts to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
gen@@ ital stimu@@ lation . du@@ h .
and then i put some ultravio@@ let fil@@ ters on my camera and took a very , very long ex@@ pos@@ ure with the particular frequ@@ en@@ cies of ultravio@@ let light and this is what i got .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina war@@ ri@@ ors .
so we built the first bar@@ e@@ foot college in 198@@ 6 .
that is the ten@@ den@@ cy to in@@ fu@@ se patterns with meaning , inten@@ tion and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
but this is a nice , s@@ len@@ der , very bad p@@ est .
and the guy just told me , &quot; there &apos;s no way . this grandmother won &apos;t even -- you know , there &apos;s no way she &apos;s ever going to let you meet this girl that &apos;s she &apos;s raising . &quot;
it means &quot; green oni@@ on for free . &quot;
we &apos;re not ready for what &apos;s coming at us .
oh , look how it lies there .
i didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was veget@@ arian .
now , this nice picture shows a thou@@ ght-@@ balloon , a thou@@ ght-@@ bubble .
it &apos;s as though we &apos;re using them as sp@@ are parts to support our fra@@ gi@@ le sense of self .
action .
our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
and our ability to imagine is what makes us explor@@ ers .
well , one last story , very quickly .
he said , &quot; you know that i kind of like medi@@ tation , and i pra@@ y . &quot;
the western bor@@ der of the bor@@ e@@ al in british columbia is mar@@ ked by the coast mountains , and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest rema@@ ining temper@@ ate rain@@ forest in the world , the great bear rain@@ forest , and we &apos;ll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail .
only a fe@@ ar@@ less and determin@@ ed heart will get the gold me@@ d@@ al .
so let me reas@@ sure you about something .
and they sit around , and they talk about dreams .
five years from now , this is what i hope happens to me : i &apos;m taken back to the boat , i &apos;m given a gas mas@@ k : 80 parts per million hydro@@ gen sul@@ fi@@ de .
you know what ? six of those seven v@@ oted yes in fa@@ vor of the bill , so it passed , and it passed by a vote of 4@@ 7 to 3@@ 2 .
but never like , &quot; ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . &quot;
lau@@ rie gar@@ re@@ t : what fac@@ tors deter@@ mine the du@@ ration of a pande@@ mic , we don &apos;t really know .
the other possibility -- -- is , perhaps , en@@ ri@@ co fer@@ m@@ i himself was an alien .
and the way to do that is to inv@@ est , not to say i &apos;m not invest@@ ing in that continent because there &apos;s too much corruption .
what darwin said was something like this : if you have creatures that v@@ ary , and that can &apos;t be dou@@ b@@ ted -- i &apos;ve been to the gal@@ a@@ pa@@ gos , and i &apos;ve measu@@ red the size of the be@@ a@@ ks and the size of the tur@@ tle sh@@ ells and so on , and so on .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been engaged in a field called active music .
i pull in . i put the car in park .
so , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
g-@@ h@@ -@@ e-@@ z no , so@@ 2 has already been used , actually , in the mathematical language . so you can &apos;t have that one .
but on some tri@@ als , we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell .
and everybody was really happy for me , but me .
it invol@@ ves gravit@@ ational waves .
he turns . he begins to make his way to me .
it &apos;s a female now .
again and again , back to the pain@@ ting , looking for the answer , looking for the story to fill in that gap .
yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for im@@ pulse saving .
but if you don &apos;t do that , if you allow for the accident to keep on happening , you have the possibility of getting on a wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th .
and you know what &apos;s interesting ? you won &apos;t believe it , but there are countries in which the most attra@@ ctive place to be is not the shop@@ ping center but the school .
&quot; should we be there ?
but do you see any ir@@ ony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secre@@ cy around your sour@@ ces ?
and once this path is constru@@ cted , it &apos;ll connect the south bronx with more than 400 ac@@ res of rand@@ all &apos;s island park .
technology in x-ray where it &apos;s life@@ -@@ size process@@ ed , apart from these large car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resol@@ ution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
so collabor@@ ative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ located or dist@@ ant and dist@@ in@@ ct , is always important .
i think there is really something in that artic@@ u@@ lation that is quite nice .
we know we &apos;ll do it next year , but today let us go and spend .
but you can see those spi@@ kes , and they &apos;re there .
so in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they ad@@ ored , a living person they ad@@ ored .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
so i &apos;ve been working on this a little , also , with a couple of other guys .
and i &apos;m going to show you why .
first , all the individuals are only aware of their near@@ est neighbors .
&quot; it won &apos;t up@@ set me . why ? what ? is something wrong with him ? &quot;
well , they &apos;re looking at cele@@ sti@@ al cu@@ es in the sky , some of which you and i can &apos;t see .
how many children will you get ?
if you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company , you get control , but usually it depen@@ ds on the rela@@ tive distribution of shares .
and i wa@@ ited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
it &apos;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living .
and the problem , of course , with all of this is that with all those paper forms — and i &apos;m telling you we have paper forms for every possible thing .
what is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
of course there &apos;s still a lot of old thinking out there too .
but i know that my hus@@ band &apos;s family looks forward to the moment when they can ritu@@ ally display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can ritu@@ ally re@@ count his life &apos;s narra@@ tive , wea@@ ving his story into the history of their community .
how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
they , in fact , are an en@@ danger@@ ed species themselves .
so , that &apos;s that process there . deu@@ teri@@ um and tri@@ ti@@ um goes together makes helium 5 .
and if you &apos;re among the people who create the stuff , easy is hard .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
so i started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re particip@@ ating . is it possible that we could get people to fa@@ ke it and would it lead them to partici@@ pate more ?
a ch@@ unk of rock six miles across , moving something like 50 times the speed of a ri@@ f@@ le bul@@ let , s@@ lam@@ med into the earth .
that &apos;s the part of us that ye@@ ar@@ ns for god , or something more than we find in technology .
fif@@ ty years ago in the old so@@ vi@@ et union , a team of engineers was secre@@ tly moving a large object through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and because of this , we really decided we needed some more sophi@@ st@@ icated technology .
the biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of pas@@ sing on food , food culture , what made our society .
now , one thing that kind of ties the resi@@ stance of skelet@@ al mus@@ cle to cancer -- to the cancer as a re@@ pair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skelet@@ al mus@@ cle has a factor in it called &quot; m@@ yo@@ d . &quot;
you have a fear high , you have status qu@@ o .
ted@@ x .
where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the o@@ ec@@ d ?
the econom@@ ist wrote an article about it , and lots of people have blog@@ ged about it -- tremendous fru@@ stration .
it &apos;s just as well , because it can stay where it is .
now , mu@@ mit@@ a was a fun one to name . mu@@ mit@@ a is the destro@@ yer .
they &apos;ve got that gene infe@@ cted in them as well , and they want that to live , more than anything else .
what i see is a co@@ w about to eat something deli@@ cious . what is that co@@ w eating ?
so therefore , we have these two met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ ms , and i worked with a ger@@ man chem@@ ist , michael bra@@ ung@@ art , and we &apos;ve identifi@@ ed the two fundamental met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ ms .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts from the rain@@ forests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pa@@ st@@ ure . &quot;
that &apos;s a fan@@ cy way of saying it &apos;s got shops , b@@ ars , bi@@ stro@@ s , dest@@ in@@ ations -- things go in and out of it . it &apos;s per@@ me@@ able .
in fact we have in the stimul@@ us bill -- it &apos;s interesting -- the house version actually had money in it for these data systems , and it was taken out in the sen@@ ate because there are people who are thre@@ at@@ ened by these things .
so this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
they never really co@@ di@@ fy it or quali@@ fy it or quanti@@ fy it , and say , &quot; this is what i believe in .
the first is that problems are in@@ ev@@ itable .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
so this really spi@@ kes your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
if we wanted to make a square of size 10 , 100 or 1,000 , if we used dna origami alone , we would requi@@ re a number of dna strands that &apos;s the square of the size of that square ; so we &apos;d need 100 , 10,000 or a million dna strands .
they do have a very rich re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of post@@ ures and gest@@ ures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . gre@@ eting chimpanze@@ es embra@@ cing .

let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explo@@ de it .
there &apos;ll be days like this , my mom@@ ma said . when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only bli@@ sters and bru@@ ises ; when you step out of the phone bo@@ oth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cap@@ e ; when your boots will fill with rain , and you &apos;ll be up to your k@@ ne@@ es in dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment .
and so you wouldn &apos;t sit that close to another person because of your notion that it &apos;s you versus the universe -- that &apos;s all buddha discovered .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
now , these stories are great examples of how photograph@@ y can be used to address some of our most important top@@ ics .
by 2030 , if the ma@@ ize , or cor@@ n , v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties , which is the domin@@ ant cro@@ p -- 50 percent of the nutri@@ tion in sou@@ thern africa are still in the field -- in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent decre@@ ase in production of ma@@ ize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
well , these wi@@ ki revolu@@ tions happen so fast they create a vac@@ u@@ um , and politics ab@@ h@@ ors a vac@@ u@@ um , and un@@ sa@@ vor@@ y forces can fill that , typically the old regime , or extre@@ mi@@ sts , or fundament@@ alist forces .

there we go .
i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company .
so to get at it , you first have to get rid of the trees .
one , competition .
you have a gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e and you have to have a phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
they create a dis@@ h where all the ve@@ ctors point at us .
and the high school students who were learning to blog through fo@@ ko clu@@ b suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demon@@ stra@@ tions , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
so for example , i pa@@ sted the photo of the min@@ ar@@ et in swi@@ tzer@@ land a few weeks after they v@@ oted the law for@@ bi@@ dding min@@ are@@ ts in the country .
if we &apos;re going to deal with political confli@@ ct@@ -@@ solving of conflicts , if we &apos;re going to understand these new groups which are coming from bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplo@@ ma@@ ts cannot be sitting back in the ban@@ qu@@ ets believ@@ ing that we are doing inter@@ state relations .
the ac@@ tor imple@@ ments a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we oper@@ ate .
so when we want to learn whether a planet is hab@@ itable , whether it might be am@@ enable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it recei@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space wea@@ ther -- this high-@@ energy radiation , the u@@ v and the x-@@ rays that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this bat@@ h of high-@@ energy radiation .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavi@@ oral econom@@ ists that they are kind of putting into place acade@@ mi@@ cally , what great marke@@ ters have sort of intui@@ tively known for a long time .
he stopped , and he said , &quot; yes , we would like to do that to deal with our over@@ fishing problem , and i think we would call it a re@@ verse fishing licen@@ se . &quot;
and i believe , many scientists believe that pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des are an important part of that dec@@ line .
and it was just li@@ ght@@ ning fast ; the way she was working was almost un@@ believ@@ able .
so if you have a teen@@ age son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people &apos;s perspe@@ cti@@ ves , you &apos;re right . they do . and this is why .
it needs an extremely well-@@ trained an@@ es@@ thesi@@ ologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monit@@ or the flo@@ ws of the gas and keep her patients safe and an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed throughout the surgery .
this is where the mar@@ ines in the audience get kind of ten@@ se .
so there they are .
and i think i &apos;ll take off this one .
this is an example that you might care about some@@ day , and i hope you never do , because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer .
so we came up with a list of requi@@ re@@ ments , the &quot; 10 comm@@ and@@ ments , &quot; and they were , in order of as@@ cen@@ ding diffic@@ ul@@ ty : the first is &quot; no magic . &quot;
so , no , he doesn &apos;t want that . that &apos;s a different kind of control .
it could have looked like shop windows on fif@@ th a@@ venue at christmas , but because of the way that andrew connected with the mc@@ que@@ en team , he was chan@@ n@@ eling the ra@@ w@@ ness and the brilli@@ ance of mc@@ que@@ en , and the show was quite tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ant , and it became a phenomen@@ on in its own right .
because ca@@ it@@ ria and i live here in boston .
maybe a little more time ? &quot;
we are all responsible .
this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain .
2008 , 2009 were hea@@ vy years for me for another reason , too .
ev@@ a zei@@ sel : are you sure ?
and so i went to see him because he has just worked on pho@@ bias for a long time , which i &apos;m very interested in .
it &apos;s now been f@@ da appro@@ ved , and it &apos;ll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .
your body has many organs and every single or@@ gan in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of in@@ jury . it happens every day .
we &apos;ve got a million people on the site already , so we can hand@@ le a few more .
in fact , i have got quali@@ fi@@ cations .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play bas@@ ket@@ ball at re@@ cess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
and i will very quickly show you how it works .
right .
this is a statue from ox@@ ford .
and this is when it really gets interesting .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago .
and now the most important thing , that is the mo@@ od on@@ stage .
but it &apos;s not just as simple as making sure there &apos;s no child labor .
well , they used it .
you know , my grand@@ father died many years ago when i was little , but his love for ma@@ e west lives on as a mis@@ sp@@ elling in the dna of his pro@@ gen@@ y .
language changes over time , and it &apos;s a powerful force .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activi@@ sts met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or scre@@ ened against , or maybe places where electro@@ des could be put in for people who have very sever@@ e dis@@ ability .
and anybody who wants to do science is -- this is about the time that isa@@ ac new@@ ton was starting to whi@@ p out a lot of really interesting things .
and ri@@ l@@ ke , &quot; if your da@@ ily life seems poor , do not bl@@ ame it ; bl@@ ame yourself .
well , there &apos;s also another program , in another agency within our government , in ocean exploration .
and i think that &apos;s such an order of mag@@ ni@@ tude change that your grand@@ kids or your great@@ -@@ grand@@ kids may be a species very different from you .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
now , when he spe@@ a@@ ks about plants , everything is corre@@ ct .
on september 10 , the morning of my sev@@ ent@@ h birthday , i came down@@ sta@@ irs to the kitchen , where my mother was was@@ hing the dis@@ hes and my father was reading the paper or something , and i sort of pres@@ ented myself to them in the do@@ or@@ way , and they said , &quot; hey , happy birthday ! &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;m seven . &quot;
and those leaders did not emer@@ ge spon@@ taneously .
this kind of diagra@@ m is called a balloon race .
and let me say this without a tra@@ ce of ir@@ ony -- before i back it up to a bunch of ex@@ -@@ hi@@ pp@@ ies .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind technology is we &apos;d have to take up rough@@ ly from the 10 to mul@@ h@@ oll@@ and , and from the 40@@ 5 to la ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ ds .
so that &apos;s why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
more people are living there than the land could possibly support .
art would pick up the du@@ ty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted because of certain mis@@ -@@ fo@@ unded ideas .
so a person that &apos;s inter@@ acting with the robot under@@ stands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its mo@@ tions .
so to conclu@@ de , there are at least four asteroi@@ ds head@@ ed our way .
so , it basically d@@ war@@ fs , you know , mo@@ unt ever@@ est here on earth .
but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series .
i would see afri@@ cans in the same way that i , as a child , had seen fi@@ de &apos;s family .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , ar@@ gent@@ ina and mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que together 50 years ago , and says that mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que did worse .
and yet , looking at them , you would see a machine and a molecule .
when are we going to do it ? are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years ?
what they didn &apos;t tell us is that some car@@ bs are better than others , and that plants and whole gra@@ ins should be sup@@ plan@@ ting eating jun@@ k food .
and it just started about 14 months ago .
right now , earth is the only planet still that we know is te@@ em@@ ing with life .
but now , what does religion have to do with it ?
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .
my gei@@ ger coun@@ ter do@@ si@@ meter , which meas@@ ures radiation , was going ber@@ ser@@ k , and the closer i got , the more fr@@ ene@@ tic it became , and fran@@ tic . my god .
we don &apos;t live in the world our mothers lived in , our grand@@ mothers lived in , where career choices for women were so limited .
we &apos;ve done these things in research now in every single company that i &apos;ve worked with , getting them to write down three new things that they &apos;re gr@@ at@@ eful for for 2@@ 1 days in a row , three new things each day .
and so some really nice things came together .
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we &apos;re at and where we &apos;re going .
thanks for that .
now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechan@@ ics here .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
i have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
the lunch la@@ dies , the lunch co@@ o@@ ks of america -- i offer myself as their am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
we could make cars bigger , which is prote@@ ctive , but make them light .
and it &apos;s got this funny hor@@ n-@@ shaped thing , which as far as i know , again , the first co@@ ok@@ book to ever do this .
and we &apos;re disco@@ vering , with our research , that &apos;s often very local to the no@@ de you care about within one or two degre@@ es .
it &apos;s looking at whatever i &apos;ve designed . it will actually bring it to life .
i &apos;m not going to read them all to you because i &apos;m not in teacher mode .
my tea party lun@@ ch@@ mate and i came up with these : don &apos;t per@@ su@@ ade , de@@ fend or inter@@ ru@@ pt .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some cri@@ teria of how to choose work .
it &apos;s not just top@@ shop , i get some strange looks when i go out getting my pro@@ ps .
we &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
we have no ways to directly obser@@ ve molecules and what they do -- dre@@ w ber@@ ry wants to change that . in this talk , he shows his scienti@@ fically accurate anima@@ tions that help researchers see un@@ see@@ able process@@ es within our own cells . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and when that ecosystem collap@@ ses , it could take a major ecosystem with it , like our atmosphere . so , what do we do about this ? what are the solutions ?
now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , cop@@ ying your dna with ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te fi@@ deli@@ ty .
in my dreams i fan@@ t@@ asi@@ ze of w@@ re@@ aking ven@@ ge@@ ance on you guys .
anyway , sky@@ lines are super glam@@ or@@ ous , city streets -- not so glam@@ or@@ ous .
but of course not all of them were that small .
so there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
on the other side , the dose was redu@@ ced to 50 percent , and just look at the y@@ i@@ eld .
they dres@@ sed differently ; they were different people .
i was like , &quot; what does that mean ? &quot;
they don &apos;t read music .
they have to o@@ be@@ y four simple laws .
this demo -- from pat@@ t@@ ie ma@@ es &apos; lab at mit , spe@@ ar@@ head@@ ed by pr@@ an@@ a@@ v mi@@ stry -- was the bu@@ zz of ted . it &apos;s a we@@ ar@@ able device with a proje@@ ctor that pa@@ ves the way for profound interaction with our environment . imagine &quot; min@@ ority report &quot; and then some .
there was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site .
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
and you know , there &apos;s a new version of windows coming out this fall .
it &apos;s not broken . it &apos;s wonder@@ fully constru@@ cted .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- im@@ men@@ se numbers .
now just trying putting a few gra@@ ins of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes .
we &apos;re going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our he@@ arts .
we &apos;re interested in big dis@@ plays , bright dis@@ plays .
all right .
now it &apos;s evening , and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew m@@ old .
it &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly trans@@ lu@@ cent windows and we just ga@@ ze out of them and describe the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
but she reached out to us in that way , and it was , i &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ break@@ er .
i mean , there may be 100 explan@@ ations for why ha@@ iti is the im@@ pover@@ ished nation it is , but there is no ex@@ cu@@ se to see that sort of squ@@ al@@ or .
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apo@@ logi@@ zing to me for cr@@ ying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me pro@@ ps , li@@ f@@ ting me up , for not cr@@ ying .
i think a great example of this is eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new health exten@@ sion program .
and the rus@@ si@@ an special military police , special forces , sp@@ et@@ sna@@ z , came in and actually stor@@ med the theater .
and that is where , la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important .
all right . very significant mark .
and that was the beginning of a kind of ser@@ ial de@@ ple@@ tion from bigger and ta@@ sti@@ er species to smaller and not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ ta@@ sty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
and you can &apos;t find this guy on google ; you can &apos;t find him anywhere .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
so we need new policies , we need -- where &apos;s that coming from , you know ?
the more interesting question is : did it matter they were con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating the par@@ able of the good sa@@ mar@@ it@@ an ? answer : no , not at all .
we still need to complete the scre@@ ening study using the low dose , and then our fin@@ dings will need to be rep@@ licated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
there &apos;s no accident in names of these restaurants .
it allows el@@ em@@ ent@@ ar@@ y-@@ level students to learn core subje@@ cts through game play and activity and running around and scre@@ am@@ ing and being a kid .
in fact , though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice , we don &apos;t all see choice in the same places or to the same ex@@ tent .
the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s , micro@@ soft started an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia called en@@ car@@ ta .
like a job interview . you sit across the desk from somebody , they have some pri@@ or image of you , you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be .
i didn &apos;t get that si@@ gh@@ ted .
this got me thinking .
easy win@@ s . i should just go and name the coun@@ ties that we &apos;ve got around here .
now actually , that &apos;s just another par@@ o@@ chi@@ al mis@@ con@@ ception .
pat@@ ri@@ ci@@ a ryan : don &apos;t ins@@ ist on english !
one , two , three .
it &apos;s a beautiful song written by a guy called martin ev@@ an , actually , for me .
so what started out as an idea , is now being imple@@ mented to chur@@ n out millions of sequences that we can use to investig@@ ate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pa@@ tho@@ gens .
but when money comes increasingly to go@@ ver@@ n access to the essen@@ ti@@ als of the good life -- de@@ cent health care , access to the best education , political voice and influ@@ ence in campaig@@ ns -- when money comes to go@@ ver@@ n all of those things , in@@ equality matters a great deal .
it &apos;s powerful for two reasons . you recognize it fast , and you associ@@ ate it very power@@ fully .
they had to intu@@ b@@ ate her , so they put a tube down her thro@@ at and they began to mechan@@ ically venti@@ late her .
because in the beginning , the growing inti@@ macy wasn &apos;t yet so strong that it actually led to the decre@@ ase of desire .
when you &apos;re de@@ aling with the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand edge of one of these distribu@@ tions , when you &apos;re de@@ aling with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want , that &apos;s an institution@@ -@@ as@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ ler world .

you can start doing things like , you know , trans@@ it systems that actually work to transport people , in effective and reas@@ on@@ ably comfortable man@@ ners .
some people have the mis@@ gui@@ ded idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing or doing something like that .

when i first went to hollywood , they said -- i used to talk about subtext , and my ag@@ ent came to me , &quot; would you kin@@ dly not talk about subtext ? &quot;

and the problem is that it &apos;s based on this half-@@ truth , which is that americans eat too many simple car@@ bs , so if you eat fe@@ wer simple car@@ bs you &apos;re going to lose weight .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s got to do with rock@@ ets or it wouldn &apos;t be in that manu@@ al .

mit resear@@ cher sky@@ l@@ ar ti@@ b@@ bits works on self-@@ assem@@ bly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves , much the way a strand of dna zi@@ ps itself together . it &apos;s a big concept at early st@@ ages ; ti@@ b@@ bits shows us three in-@@ the-@@ lab projects that hin@@ t at what a self-@@ assem@@ bl@@ ing future might look like .

so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
this is a typical pa@@ th@@ way in ro@@ cin@@ ha called a &quot; bec@@ o &quot; -- these are how you get around the community .
now , as@@ ca@@ p said they didn &apos;t care .
but it does suggest that that number might be a little big .
look at the site that he built : &quot; star wars &quot; ma@@ shu@@ ps , inv@@ iting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extra@@ ordin@@ arily important cultural ic@@ on .

but in the last year , where president si@@ r@@ lea@@ f comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
teachers who have been teaching science for don@@ key years , they just mu@@ ck up the definition and they sp@@ it it out .
in order to solve these puzz@@ les effectively , if you think about it , your mind needs to be in two states si@@ mul@@ taneously .

as a result , he spent just four days in ho@@ spi@@ ce , is a pretty typical out@@ come , and we never said go@@ od@@ by@@ e because we were un@@ prepared for the end .
they taught me how to look and see , and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child , &quot; of all these things we already make you , which do you like best ? &quot; -- which gives you zero answers that are us@@ able .

and once we get involved in the ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic decisions , again either personally or with our loved ones and family members , we also very quickly learn the benef@@ its , the tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s and the limit@@ ations of these tools .
and i think understanding that could revolutionize ta@@ x policy .
and i want to talk about three st@@ ages in that evolution .
so i started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consi@@ sten@@ cy -- people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still per@@ si@@ sts -- and it has a kind of res@@ ili@@ ence that allows it to pers@@ ist across time .
he said , &quot; talk to her about religion and philosoph@@ y .

and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the la@@ undry at home , or they have to bring the la@@ undry away to a stream far off .
so i started off in a traditional mode .

and everything comes towards that , and they watch it cre@@ eping up , and they own that as it goes along .
they &apos;re also now small enough to sit on a des@@ k@@ top .

so he &apos;s working on a tool right there that can actually change the over@@ all system .
it is inspi@@ ring . a lot of us believe that that has to be the world &apos;s future .
it is a need . it is an ur@@ ge .

the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first sign@@ al of human inten@@ tions .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light len@@ sed around it , and we could even start to cross into that sha@@ do@@ w and really not notice that anything dra@@ matic had happened .
so this was before the computer was invented .

or , &quot; how can we help ? &quot;
what if we imag@@ ined the upper east side with green roo@@ fs , and stre@@ ams win@@ ding through the city , and wind@@ mil@@ ls sup@@ pl@@ ying the power we need ?
and when you &apos;re standing with someone , and you &apos;re on your mobile device , effectively what you &apos;re saying to them is , &quot; you are not as important as , literally , almost anything that could come to me through this device . &quot;
so our model is learn math the way you &apos;d learn anything , like the way you would learn a bicycle .
but she asked me a question : how confi@@ dent was i that i would find a tumor early on her mammo@@ gra@@ m if she developed one ?

and across the world today , we see a sort of cy@@ ber arms race , with cyber@@ war units built up by countries like north kor@@ e@@ a or even iran .

how are we using it ?
before he was a le@@ gend , architect frank ge@@ hr@@ y takes a whist@@ le@@ stop tour of his early work , from his house in ven@@ ice beach to the american center in paris , which was under construction when he gave this talk .

what we can say , number one , as the su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t said in citizens united , that people have the ultimate influ@@ ence over ele@@ cted offici@@ als , because , after all , there is a general election , but only after the le@@ sters have had their way with the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es who wish to run in the general election .
well let &apos;s think about what really happens .
and it was a time when a guy who , kind of , could cross the two si@@ des -- it was a good time .

but it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before .
today , people in silicon valley and el@@ se@@ where speak of the i@@ its , the indian institu@@ tes of technology with the same re@@ ver@@ ence they used to accor@@ d to mit .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaph@@ or which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
better put that up .
there &apos;s no waste .
it &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
well , i &apos;m not here today to lam@@ ent about the situation , or wr@@ ing my hands .
i mean this is serious . you &apos;re afraid .
media tells us every day what &apos;s important , by the stories they choose and where they place them .
that &apos;s the current business model .
i cho@@ se the gun .
technology always comes into play when design is involved , but science does a little less .
so what we need is to have a cau@@ sa@@ tive model of what &apos;s actually going on , and prote@@ om@@ ics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that .
when i put that to the president of sierra leone , the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give exper@@ ti@@ se on how to condu@@ ct au@@ ctions .
they have it for people with aller@@ gi@@ es to pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
boy : what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i lived in ireland , built the first stra@@ w-@@ b@@ ale houses in ireland , and some co@@ b buildings and all this kind of thing .
par@@ amount am@@ ong@@ st those was the reali@@ zation that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind .
among the 200 million mi@@ gr@@ ant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
it invol@@ ves communic@@ ators to keep the funding high , to keep the visi@@ bility high , to tell the success stories .
she cut the heads off of her flies .
you can use y@@ ar@@ d@@ stick competition , so they have to compe@@ te against each other for the resources .
so we didn &apos;t really have that many hur@@ d@@ les , i have to say , with the government and all the auth@@ orities .
&quot; it was awesome .
who are all of the other women on these d@@ ating sites ?
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
i was like , &quot; david cri@@ es when you in@@ vi@@ te him to take a walk . &quot;
now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , i &apos;m afraid , to the present .
i think what he was comp@@ la@@ ining about is not universities but rather the le@@ ctu@@ re-@@ based format that so many universities spend so much time on .
but it &apos;s very good that what is done is being done .
up until recently , that was the solar system -- four ear@@ th-@@ like planets with small radi@@ us , smaller than about two times the size of the earth -- and that was of course mer@@ cur@@ y , ven@@ us , mars , and of course the earth , and then the two big , giant planets .
i &apos;ve done about 40 of them , and i &apos;d say 30 of them are based on that concept .
all right . so we &apos;re going to immer@@ se ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because , you know , it &apos;s really nai@@ ve to think that the e@@ aster bun@@ ny put all the resources on the contin@@ ents .
and i have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be su@@ bli@@ ma@@ ted to other needs .
and this person , mr. ubi@@ ra@@ j@@ ara .
but wilkins said &quot; no . &quot; ro@@ sal@@ ind franklin was leaving in about two months , and after she left he would start building models .
by the way , the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is &quot; ey@@ j@@ af@@ j@@ al@@ la@@ jo@@ kul@@ l . &quot;
they asked this question .
use more force ?
perhaps more importantly , tens of thousands of people jo@@ ined the adv@@ oc@@ acy programs and the activ@@ ism programs that we created to go around the movies .
sit in bed , two in the morning , watch tv ; your spo@@ use , or someone , is next to you , as@@ le@@ ep ; doesn &apos;t hear it , doesn &apos;t wake up .
over 85 percent of all pan@@ crea@@ tic can@@ cers are diagno@@ sed late , when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival .
now , this quickly , my day job sent me to work out of our mil@@ an office for a few months , so i was like , what will i do ? so i actually sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed sleep on my calendar , and spent the 8@@ -@@ hour time difference on conference calls with material supp@@ li@@ ers , manufactur@@ ers and potential custom@@ ers .
so i looked at the cul@@ tiv@@ ation of information as if it were food and said , so we were h@@ unter@@ -@@ ga@@ thers of information .
it &apos;s perfectly possible to create these social pres@@ sur@@ es which lead to more e@@ gal@@ it@@ arian societies .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
and finally , of course , i think it &apos;s fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambi@@ valent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier , the cop@@ ing strategy .
what it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
let &apos;s go for it , and while we &apos;re about it , let &apos;s have a bit of fun , for us , for the students and for ted here .
we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product .
and how we manage our built environment affe@@ cts the health and well-@@ being of people every single day .
she did ac@@ cept and then bac@@ ked away .
and that &apos;s a huge thing .
at that time , drum tri@@ g@@ gers were new .
and i know it bo@@ thers some of my blind friends , it &apos;s not just me .
and in the context of particular cour@@ ses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the mis@@ concep@@ tions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
and then as the agency explained to me , they said , &quot; look , we don &apos;t have little green people in our country ; why would we put little green people in our ads , for instance ? &quot;

almost all of the details , almost all of the surface in@@ tri@@ c@@ ac@@ ies were pres@@ er@@ ved .

it looks like a small sle@@ eping ba@@ g for a baby .

now , the connection between biology and dna and life is very tan@@ tali@@ zing when you talk about c@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus because , even back then , his follo@@ wers very quickly made the logi@@ cal step to ask : if the earth is just a planet , then what about planets around other stars ?
that stru@@ ck a ch@@ ord , and i said , &quot; that &apos;s true . &quot;
but nonetheless , despite the ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty , fire@@ figh@@ ters left the vehicle and success@@ fully f@@ ought the fire .
let me define the terms really quickly .
and if the angle is right , you can actually see a h@@ olog@@ ra@@ m appear in this film of silk .
at other times , we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much , and things just become a sort of little bit like this .
sometimes edi@@ tors would tell their car@@ to@@ oni@@ sts to draw what they wanted to see , and the guy has to feed his family , right ?
there &apos;s bar@@ ely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced .
that &apos;s what my home@@ girl is doing .

we &apos;re talking about a society that is re@@ treating into depression and dis@@ association when we are poten@@ tially con@@ fron@@ ting the next great cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c climate shift .

and when we said to our parents and grand@@ parents , &quot; how would you feel if tomorrow morning you wo@@ ke up black ? &quot;
there was something you could have said to your kid when he or she said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
and the military histor@@ i@@ ans taught me , during that qu@@ est , that military conflicts are typically put into three categ@@ ories : local bat@@ t@@ les , regi@@ onal or theater wars , and the rare but all@@ -@@ important global , world war -- strate@@ gic conflicts .

we &apos;re explor@@ ing the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hard@@ ware technology .

here you are , pul@@ ling off the band@@ -@@ aid .
my view is that if you want to invol@@ ve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on , you have to look like the solution and not the problem .
the poli@@ team@@ a is the city . it &apos;s all of us together .
it &apos;s so simple , and we thought , you know , okay , it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year .
all the other countries , for example the united k@@ ing@@ dom , can bor@@ row only against the amount of money in circu@@ lation inside its own bor@@ ders .
and i think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20 , you &apos;ve probably impro@@ ved your lifest@@ yle by a lot , say your sal@@ ary , you &apos;d notice , or your kids , you &apos;d notice .
our own sense of self-@@ ag@@ gran@@ di@@ z@@ ement feels that big important problems need to have big important , and most of all , expensive solutions atta@@ ched to them .
the problem is not the things we feel vi@@ cti@@ ms of .
ok , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
last year at ted we a@@ im@@ ed to try to cl@@ ari@@ fy the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming comple@@ xity and ri@@ chn@@ ess that we experience at the conference in a project called big vi@@ z .
imagine if they had con@@ dom@@ s , giving out to all sorts of people .
one can see here quite clearly , you can see we have 25 p@@ ale green elements , of which one is in the form of a circle .
and the other puzz@@ le is that i &apos;m actually okay with that .
and over the years , around the turn of the 20th century , it started to take on this other kind of de@@ ception -- this definition for any artificial interest in , or association with , an object through which it appears del@@ usi@@ vely mag@@ ni@@ fied or gl@@ ori@@ fied .
or , as ge@@ off@@ re@@ y moore once told me , it &apos;s intelle@@ ctu@@ al curi@@ osity that &apos;s the trade that br@@ ands need in the age of the blo@@ go@@ sphere .
at a ma@@ cr@@ o level , he thought , you know , we talk about democracy pro@@ motion , but we do it in a way sometimes that &apos;s an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t to people &apos;s dig@@ ni@@ ty .
this is not about proje@@ cting power , but about sta@@ ying power , which is about le@@ gi@@ ti@@ macy with the lo@@ cals .
to bor@@ row a concept from my country &apos;s ci@@ a , it hel@@ ps you to so@@ ften up your audience .
well first of all , it is a mind , which is a flow of mental images .
and it had to be run in a quite new way .
d@@ g : it works too well . you see there &apos;re some fish inside here as well .
then a typical mom respon@@ ds , &quot; stop that non@@ sense . &quot;
audience : 2@@ 3 .
but in the mean time , perhaps you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , who is this game designer to be talking to us about dea@@ th@@ bed re@@ gre@@ ts ?
they were not people from outside .
i mean , think about that . how gr@@ and . how ambi@@ tious .
and we do like a co@@ ck@@ tail or two .
genes send the instru@@ ctions to make proteins .
we have just published an ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
why the need for accu@@ mul@@ ating money , then doing phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y ?
so , me@@ me@@ tics : me@@ me@@ tics is fo@@ unded on the principle of universal darwin@@ ism .
and now , for my next number , i &apos;d like to return to the classi@@ cs .
my role is to bring a voice to people who are vo@@ ic@@ eless .
audience : shake . fold .
it is r@@ ough and it is flat .
the point about the tri@@ g@@ ger@@ -@@ pul@@ l@@ ers and special oper@@ ations comm@@ and .
i was that girl .
so we try and get rid of those , and so doing , try to get rid of the hab@@ its , the emotions , the ideas that ens@@ la@@ ve us , that make our eyes closed , give us tun@@ ne@@ l vision so we don &apos;t see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that .
let &apos;s assu@@ me you go to the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , or you might go to mexico . you might go to latin america , asia , africa , anywhere in sau@@ di arab@@ ia .
my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simpli@@ city of a face .
they are basically bro@@ ad@@ band , collabor@@ ation and encoura@@ gement put together .
what &apos;s the regu@@ lation of the reser@@ ve and what is the regu@@ lation of the parks ?
thank you .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spit@@ ting water and inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ating them -- then the choices go down .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
so , you know , for years i would go to b@@ ars and , sort of , anyone i met whose name was eric i was hum@@ ping immediately , or something .
bill joy : what i &apos;m wor@@ ried about , what i &apos;m excited about
as you see , there &apos;s a high cor@@ relation between temperature , co2 and sea level .
and then , because i &apos;m looking for the up@@ side here , i &apos;ve got to have believ@@ able up@@ side .
&quot; my name is bond , ja@@ mal bond . &quot;
today we can &apos;t yet do that , but i think the path is la@@ id out .
the key is , how do you put all of the others ?
and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know who rais@@ ed her , but , &quot; he said , &quot; she &apos;s running the or@@ phan@@ age , and she &apos;s been here three days . &quot;
and the reason is that tool use , in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modi@@ fication of self .
you may have heard about the koran &apos;s idea of par@@ ad@@ ise being 72 virg@@ ins , and i promis@@ e i will come back to those virg@@ ins .
and we &apos;re going to fix them by im@@ pos@@ ing back on them street and block systems and re@@ turning to the building lot as the normal incre@@ ment of development .
and like the one you just saw , it can produce these as b@@ ands of light .
the li@@ ke@@ lihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a mi@@ le@@ stone somewhere in the middle .
i am mi@@ ster michael ban@@ go@@ ora , the son of late mi@@ ster ti@@ am@@ u ban@@ go@@ ora -- who was the minister of finance in sierra leone -- but was killed during a civil war .
and the first go@@ at , che@@ wing away , says , &quot; you know , this film is not bad . &quot;
that &apos;s where it started .
and then over the summer , they &apos;re off@@ ered a summer job .
pa@@ tho@@ s appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl &apos;s drawing .
the bert ru@@ t@@ ans and richard bran@@ sons of this world have got this in their si@@ ghts and i sal@@ ute them .
because it &apos;s so different , what has happened there .
and i look at something like this and it makes me question , if we were to take all the func@@ tion@@ ality in things like this , and re@@ distribu@@ te them around the body in some kind of personal area network , how would we pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze where to put stuff ?
for example , terrorism . terr@@ ori@@ sts are always adap@@ ting in min@@ or and major ways to new cir@@ cum@@ stances , and despite what you might see on tv , these adap@@ tations , and the dete@@ ction of them , are fundamentally human .
but the one that &apos;s really been sort of stres@@ sing me out , that i haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , gal@@ va@@ o . &quot;
down below here , we see calls made by both mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es that also carry over very long ran@@ ges .
so you can think about how un@@ st@@ able that would be .
we haven &apos;t expor@@ ted one kil@@ ogra@@ m yet .
this is a full bottle of cal@@ ms for@@ te .
to me , the most mind-@@ ben@@ ding example of the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ dness of the ocean comes from an ac@@ ou@@ stic experiment where oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ pher@@ s took a ship to the sou@@ thern indian ocean , de@@ plo@@ yed an underwater lou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ er and played back a sound .
it &apos;s a positive , virtu@@ ous circle .
the ag@@ ony as an act of passion . &quot;
well we can begin to ask those questions also .
so this is comb@@ ining the fe@@ der@@ al level , which is the largest , the state level and the local level .
i don &apos;t know .
their answer was interesting .
they switch really fast , very swi@@ ft@@ ly . they pay a very small cost .
the question is : how long will it take you to fill it up ?
so it &apos;s really quite big .
you can also start to change what you build .
this is inti@@ macy to women .
so the temperature has been , sort of , in@@ ching up .
if it &apos;s a tail , you crack open the cham@@ pagne .
these are people who are productive ag@@ ents in the economy .
follow your passion -- we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
gene even did a little ti@@ le work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from h@@ ills of kor@@ e@@ a to live happ@@ ily ever after in atlan@@ ta . &quot;
proje@@ ctions are that we could lose pol@@ ar be@@ ars ; they could become extin@@ ct in the next 50 to 100 years .
it &apos;s sort of &quot; me , &quot; not &quot; we . &quot;
nar@@ ration : &quot; the country . &quot;
there is an economy of scale .
this number is 17 and a half thousand sli@@ des long , and we know it is prime as confi@@ d@@ ently as we know the number seven is prime .
now , yeah , what do we mean by beautiful ? that &apos;s one thing .
and you should see me during the match .
da@@ ve de@@ bron@@ k@@ art : meet e-@@ patient da@@ ve
that &apos;s what makes a lot of afri@@ cans very angry .
and when you start changing , you cannot stop .
and you might be reli@@ ev@@ ed to know even rather distingu@@ ished mathemati@@ cians think that .
they synchr@@ oni@@ ze their sounds and their body post@@ ures to look bigger and sound stronger .
and now with one dollar , you can afford a better alternative than the people market is off@@ ering you .
it &apos;s one of my ho@@ b@@ by@@ hor@@ ses .
that will encourage the spread of relatively ben@@ ig@@ n mu@@ tations of the most toxic v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties .
but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be inv@@ ited to talk about it .
what do we typically finance ?
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
anyway , he &apos;s that kind of pat@@ r@@ on .
now , in 190@@ 8 , over si@@ ber@@ ia , near the t@@ ung@@ us@@ ka region -- for those of you who are dan a@@ y@@ kro@@ y@@ d fan@@ s and saw &quot; g@@ ho@@ st@@ bu@@ sters , &quot; when he talked about the greatest cros@@ s-@@ dimensional ri@@ ft since the si@@ ber@@ ia bl@@ ast of 190@@ 9 , where he got the date wrong , but that &apos;s okay .
so that &apos;s a ch@@ unk of what we &apos;re looking for .
and i walked in their prototyp@@ e facili@@ ty , and it &apos;s exactly like my shop , only bigger -- same tools , same things .
now , you could describe this as a simple mis@@ understanding -- a strange en@@ coun@@ ter among humans .
the ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a city bom@@ bing was simple technology , horri@@ bly used .
and what we &apos;re saying is that , shouldn &apos;t our cities do at least as well , in terms of ecosystem services , as the native systems that they re@@ place ?
this means that we have to focus on how our you@@ th are going to be engaged in productive en@@ dea@@ vor in their lives .
so if you put it in the front door , your design fa@@ ils .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely ten photos per photograph@@ er , is a lie .
and gre@@ ed and hu@@ br@@ is are inti@@ ma@@ tely inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed when it comes to re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness .
what the others are here for , i &apos;ve no idea . &quot;
and that &apos;s a problem , because we have to make it as important a job , because it &apos;s the har@@ dest job in the world to work inside the home , for people of both gen@@ ders , if we &apos;re going to even things out and let women stay in the work@@ force .
and who better to ask than 25 ei@@ ght@@ - to 10@@ -year-old children ?
they were tough questions . there &apos;s pol@@ ari@@ zed groups down there .
and i want to show you one of our tests .
the hig@@ gs , over here on the left , has a large mass and brea@@ ks the symme@@ try of this electro@@ weak pattern .
but of course , that was in au@@ stri@@ a at the hei@@ ght of roman@@ tic lyri@@ c@@ ism , not here in the sub@@ ur@@ bs of cle@@ vel@@ and .
we hope that the embra@@ ce inf@@ ant war@@ mer and other simple innova@@ tions like this repres@@ ent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , lo@@ c@@ alized , aff@@ ord@@ able solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
for example , all mas@@ ks are made in china .
jo@@ e , we &apos;re going to keep doing this ti@@ ll you catch it .
we said , &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot;
well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for star@@ ters .
david kel@@ ley : how to build your creative confidence
and a lot of people ask me , you know , what kind of people do you get for a project like this ?
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radi@@ c@@ alization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
and i photographed all of the wr@@ ong@@ fully convi@@ cted at sites that came to particular signific@@ ance in the history of their wr@@ ong@@ ful convi@@ ction .
and i learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
as opposed to learning with ma@@ de-@@ up sent@@ ences , people are learning with real content , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting .
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
after two years of an innovative design and construction process , the proof of concept made its public de@@ but in 2008 .
we certainly don &apos;t want to give up the rights , when people do something wrong , to see@@ k re@@ dres@@ s in the cour@@ ts .
but there are other things that people believe that are significant , like the eff@@ ic@@ acy of home@@ op@@ a@@ thy , or that evolution is just , you know , sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs , or , you know , evolution , all that sort of thing , or global warming .
and so , here , in the gulf of ma@@ ine at 7@@ 40 feet , i can name pretty much everything you &apos;re seeing there to the species level .
you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine , where people are put in the sun to get better .
the head nur@@ se told me pr@@ ou@@ dly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-@@ beha@@ ved . &quot;
and for those living in the most de@@ human@@ i@@ zing conditions of mental illness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beauty of music off@@ ers a chance for them to tran@@ sc@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not for@@ gotten them .
any one of you now is an exper@@ t on st el@@ ev@@ ation . can you see it there ?
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m her un@@ cle , she &apos;s fine , you can leave now . &quot;
well , there was an american marine pri@@ est that i had met in the course of doing the story , who had 75 children living in his house .
so i turned to the te@@ em@@ ing small creatures that can be held between the th@@ um@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger : the little things that com@@ pose the foundation of our eco@@ systems , the little things , as i like to say , who run the world .
this kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins -- not only by color but literally by alphabet letters .
so he went on this re@@ treat . and he medi@@ t@@ ated for three years and he did not see the future buddha ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya .
so , obviously , you cannot have two principles of justi@@ ce , one for yourself and one for others .
dan@@ a : there &apos;s too much dar@@ k@@ ness .
but yes , it &apos;s also true that the internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with priv@@ acy .
my team at inter@@ ax@@ on and i have been developing thr@@ ou@@ ght-@@ controll@@ ed app@@ lication for almost a decade now .
and one of these principles is focus .
and if there &apos;s any revolution , they cut off the water .
at this moment in time , the you@@ th in the arab world are much more wi@@ ser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ide@@ ological old regi@@ mes .
i &apos;ve lived in the muslim world , spo@@ ken with a lot of muslim women .
pizza for break@@ fast . they don &apos;t even get given cro@@ ck@@ ery .
the great con@@ servative in@@ sight is that order is really hard to achieve .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of that long , extended process .
the european union emplo@@ ys a permanent st@@ af@@ f of about 2,@@ 500 trans@@ lat@@ ors .
and , for sure , i haven &apos;t looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .
could you please show that ?
you can &apos;t sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you don &apos;t know who they are .
so in order for all this to work , obviously i have got to be in a position of trust .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
so you want to be a little bit below the average number , but not too far below , and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well .
remember that image from the beginning ?
the vast maj@@ ority of people who are infe@@ cted with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the land@@ ing of an astero@@ id .
and if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
r@@ ats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment .
in 200@@ 5 , the world watched as new or@@ le@@ ans and the gulf coast were deva@@ st@@ ated by hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e kat@@ r@@ ina .
and then , we had a ch@@ at with the farmers , and we said , &quot; we &apos;re really serious about this , &quot; but they didn &apos;t actually believe us , so we thought , okay , what should we do ? i know . if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loy@@ al@@ ty to that product , maybe they &apos;ll change their mind and see we &apos;re serious .
these laws respect universal human rights and they are gro@@ unded in evidence .
we pre@@ program it .
here we can see the damage .
and this is my favorite one . my mother used to say to me , &quot; just because your sister jump@@ s in the lake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;
these are images that come from han@@ na da@@ ma@@ si@@ o &apos;s lab , and which show you , in a living brain , the re@@ construction of that brain .
my background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect .
the phrase &quot; god is sub@@ tle &quot; appears again and again , and indeed , the whole of the koran is far more sub@@ tle than most of us have been led to believe .
what &apos;s awesome is what happens when you give the pi@@ an@@ o circu@@ it to people .
that was , of course , by le cor@@ bu@@ si@@ er , the famous architect .
the ber@@ lin wall falls . we do desert stor@@ m .
please keep your back straight , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot; -- where i was probably just going to end up absolutely ri@@ gi@@ d , fro@@ zen , and i would not be able to stri@@ ke the drum , because i was thinking of so many other things -- he said , &quot; ev@@ el@@ yn , take this drum away for seven days , and i &apos;ll see you next week . &quot;
thank you .
and yes , my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise fun@@ ds .
and at the same time , we got inv@@ ited to exhi@@ bit at the shanghai creative industry week .
so when i go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . voice : because that &apos;s what being a superhero is all about .
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 c@@ ents a page if we run things in volu@@ me .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
he says , &quot; we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan . &quot;
a great success .
i do think a reform of the international institutions is v@@ ital to this .
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
i finally went to the doctor , which was free .
i am coming from a country called ser@@ bia .
but there were two men : one man was blind , one man had no legs -- he was born like that .
now they &apos;re going to think &quot; oh , boy .
cra@@ ig v@@ enter cha@@ irs that event .
now i &apos;m going to the ted wish -- is that okay ?
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or audi@@ tory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
i asked her a little bit more about the ca@@ ve and what she plan@@ ned would happen once she went there , you know .
dy@@ s@@ mor@@ ph@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is an extreme version of the fact that we don &apos;t see ourselves as others see us .
to conclu@@ de , there are also other appli@@ cations at the hori@@ z@@ on .
if we shoot someone who wasn &apos;t ho@@ sti@@ le , at least we haven &apos;t killed them . &quot;
while i was in high school also , my dad was si@@ ck .
if we let an un@@ limited amount of power loo@@ se , then we will -- a very small number of people will be able to ab@@ use it .
but images don &apos;t need to be graphi@@ c in order to re@@ mind us of the tra@@ ge@@ dy of war .
but it &apos;s important to no@@ te that all of this retro@@ fit@@ ting is not oc@@ curr@@ ing -- just bu@@ ll@@ do@@ zers are coming and just plo@@ wing down the whole city .
nat@@ al@@ ie j@@ ere@@ mi@@ jen@@ ko : okay .
if we look at construction and manufactur@@ ing , there &apos;s major in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies , energy consumption and exc@@ essi@@ ve labor techni@@ qu@@ es .
one of my favorite gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers , the s@@ ó@@ l@@ hei@@ maj@@ ö@@ kul@@ l .
they started low , they sky@@ rock@@ et@@ ed , they pe@@ ak@@ ed up there in 2003 , and now they are down .
am@@ ory lo@@ v@@ ins : w@@ inn@@ ing the oil end@@ game
it &apos;s kind of arro@@ gant .
once it &apos;s comple@@ ted , i plan to integra@@ te the infin@@ ity mu@@ sh@@ rooms into a number of objects .
and ha@@ w@@ kes : &quot; it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean . &quot;
you can do it in a beautiful place as well , like in a lake .
right , so , a doctor says to his patient , &quot; i have bad news and worse news .
and in this case , they did .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use in the future .
they &apos;ve en@@ rich@@ ed the lives of billions .
it &apos;s ro@@ oted in a principle of re@@ tribu@@ tive justi@@ ce , or an eye for an eye , so re@@ tali@@ at@@ ory kill@@ ings have led to several deaths in the area .
boy : hey listen ! did you know that the sto@@ cks are up ?
we really showed that , yes , we can .
and just like the str@@ ings on a vio@@ lin , they can vi@@ bra@@ te in different patterns producing different musi@@ cal not@@ es .
i think that , in fact , that &quot; all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning .
we can reach them . there are pa@@ ths that enable us to reach them .
you &apos;re actually hearing and seeing the electr@@ on flow with the lines .
and you then ask the question : why is the water hot ?
james sta@@ v@@ rid@@ is : a na@@ vy ad@@ mi@@ ral &apos;s thou@@ ghts on global security
they re@@ mind us that we all have ner@@ d power .
we &apos;re not going to meet targets , provi@@ ding people with san@@ itation at this rate .
my dad said to me , &quot; that &apos;s one &quot; -- i &apos;ll explain that .
it &apos;s called programm@@ ing .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world lon@@ ge@@ vity .
and then we say , &quot; well , you want to get this behavior change .
the extended family system po@@ ols its resources together .
it &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
and they &apos;ve done it several times too .
so i hope to see more of that in the future , and hope online video distribution to be embra@@ ced by the research community .
now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term .
h@@ ence they have no option but to imple@@ ment a regi@@ mented program .
or maybe it was 3@@ 1 and a quar@@ ter percent .
how do we self-@@ identify and how mu@@ table is that identity ?
there &apos;s a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .

there are two villa@@ ges , har@@ ris and mor@@ e@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant , and together , fis@@ her@@ s worked with us to tag 8@@ 00 to 9@@ 00 fish .
it is having access to medical equi@@ p@@ ment that can actually tell who does have cancer .
it doesn &apos;t interact with the electro@@ magnetic spectrum , which is what we use to dete@@ ct things .
i was born in mexico , i grew up in mexico and along the way , i learned to love mexico .
and so i looked up what the economy was pa@@ ying for the war in iraq in the same year .
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
so let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
now , you can see africa &apos;s total de@@ bt there and the u.k. budget de@@ fic@@ it for reference .
there &apos;s something we believe that just , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
the most important thing is to be a mensch . &quot;
and it is an absolutely virg@@ in market .
so on the one hand , this is just a basic re@@ co@@ ding of the electron@@ ic medical record .
they are stories with a twi@@ st .
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you fa@@ ked your way in here ? &quot;
and the c@@ at scan reve@@ aled no blood cl@@ ots in the lung , but it showed bil@@ at@@ er@@ al , visible , pal@@ p@@ able breast mas@@ ses , breast tumor@@ s , that had meta@@ st@@ asi@@ zed wid@@ ely all over the body .
but i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s any other dom@@ ini@@ can people here , but i know that ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z , he was here yesterday .
where does creative inspiration spring from ? at te@@ din@@ dia , hollywood / b@@ ollywood dire@@ ctor she@@ k@@ ha@@ r kapu@@ r pin@@ points his source of crea@@ tivity : she@@ er , u@@ tter pan@@ ic . he shares a powerful way to un@@ le@@ ash your inner story@@ t@@ eller .
and they &apos;re happy over and over again .
now consider a situation in which the mot@@ ors stay off , the fly continu@@ es on its path and it suff@@ ers some pain@@ ful con@@ sequence such as getting za@@ pped .
these conver@@ sations are for in@@ tr@@ aspe@@ cies communication .
and if an anti@@ body is stuck to one of these things on the cell , it means &quot; that &apos;s food . &quot;
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed ri@@ ght-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
these are out there , but it &apos;s more of the personal that interests me , and this is -- this is who i am .
and those three ver@@ ses are the core of auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity .
and from all of this , i can only conclu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ gry for this .
no molecular structures would be possible , no life .
bat@@ man , fighting against bad guys , he has his u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty b@@ elt , he has his gra@@ p@@ pling ho@@ ok , he has all different kinds of g@@ ad@@ gets .
well , many of you have the image , don &apos;t you , of the spo@@ tty teenager sitting in a bas@@ ement , ha@@ cking away for not@@ ori@@ ety .
and that &apos;s why designers , more and more , are working on behavi@@ ors rather than on objects .
this is the most well-@@ known example , ta@@ da@@ o and@@ o &apos;s church of light .
that &apos;s shared value .
a tor@@ o@@ id , for those who don &apos;t know , is the surface of a dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ t or , for some of us , a ba@@ gel .
she started tail@@ or@@ ing .
because of course they didn &apos;t tell us that they had three station wa@@ g@@ ons full of dra@@ wings , model concep@@ ts , pictures -- everything i wanted , they &apos;d lo@@ cked up in the cars , because they had shown soli@@ dar@@ ity with the engineers -- and they &apos;d decided not to show me anything , in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start , because they hadn &apos;t realized , of course , that they couldn &apos;t do problem creating .
it was very pri@@ mal and more remote than anything i &apos;d ever experienced before .
str@@ ings atta@@ ched to dan@@ cers .
it &apos;s called &quot; te@@ mber@@ er@@ ana . &quot;
it is a descri@@ ption of the changes in one enzy@@ me when you dri@@ p a chemical extra@@ cted from some red gra@@ pe skin onto some cancer cells in a dis@@ h on a ben@@ ch in a laborat@@ ory somewhere .
and even though the color was pretty hi@@ de@@ ous , i did love the car , and it really c@@ em@@ ented my love aff@@ air with cars that &apos;s continued on to this day .
so , this book that i have in my hand is a dire@@ ct@@ ory of everybody who had an email address in 198@@ 2 .
and you have to realize that these inci@@ dents did not happen in convenient lo@@ cations .
isn &apos;t it weird that my 4@@ 7@@ -year-old hus@@ band is forever losing the car ?
and so the next question was : what happens when musi@@ cians are tra@@ ding back and forth , something called &quot; tra@@ ding f@@ ours , &quot; which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment ?
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all gene@@ tically identical , but they diff@@ er from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that co@@ des for one protein .
that report that land@@ ed on president johnson &apos;s desk when i was two years old -- 196@@ 5 .
the second stage that we &apos;re in now is the idea of lin@@ king pages .
and some states have differenti@@ al policies , coun@@ ty by coun@@ ty .
that &apos;s called the cir@@ cul@@ ar flow of the economy .
now we have a dancing proto@@ cell and a self-@@ replic@@ ation event . right .
and as we held on , and we brea@@ th@@ ed as one , we knew we weren &apos;t on this journey alone .
i can actually hear it now , because i see my time is ti@@ cking off .
li@@ sa mar@@ gon@@ elli : the political chemistry of oil
they didn &apos;t even want to go there .
and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continu@@ ing to go grow .
this man had just been liber@@ ated from a hu@@ tu death camp .
but governments hate the di@@ y economy , and that &apos;s why -- i took this picture in 2007 , and this is the same market in 2009 -- and i think , when the organi@@ zers of this conference were talking about radi@@ cal op@@ en@@ ness , they didn &apos;t mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone .
and let me tell you right now , it &apos;s fine that we would all be very happy with spe@@ ech .
okay , so most of you are .
and because i have a 15@@ -year-old , all i do is co@@ ok and co@@ ok and co@@ ok .
and so let &apos;s fly back in time to that memor@@ able moment .
and the limit@@ ing step here wasn &apos;t the unknown diversity of life , but rather the tax@@ on@@ om@@ ic speci@@ ali@@ sts who can identify and cat@@ alog these species that became the limit@@ ing step .
bat@@ tel@@ le laborat@@ ories and i jo@@ ined up in b@@ ell@@ ing@@ ham , washington .
we were very re@@ active , as opposed to being pro@@ active about what happened .
so in the end that powerful ambi@@ tion that had car@@ ried lincoln through his b@@ lea@@ k childhood had been realized .
well , so , that leads to kind of an ultimate question : could it be that some@@ place out there in the compu@@ ta@@ tional universe we might find our physical universe ?
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capac@@ i@@ ties that children have -- their capac@@ i@@ ties for innovation . i mean , si@@ ren@@ a last night was a mar@@ vel , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she could do .
and i s@@ lic@@ ed the little sp@@ l@@ inter@@ s of wood with a broken sh@@ ard of glass , constru@@ cted this little apartment .
these differences were highly significant .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders .
so it helped me understand industrial agriculture , which of course is a car@@ tes@@ ian system .
it &apos;s about context .
i &apos;m often asked , what surpris@@ es you about the book ?
plus , why would sant@@ a save time by having to loo@@ p back to our house after he &apos;d gone to everybody else &apos;s ?
millions of people have lost the ability to trans@@ late these bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ms into action , into movement .
so our doctors said these are eye can@@ dies .
he got thro@@ wn in ja@@ il for it , but i have his words tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on my brain .
we already know how to kill malaria , but some people come to you and say , &quot; you have your millions . how about bed nets ? &quot;
let me tell you an ancient chinese satur@@ day after@@ no@@ on kung f@@ u secret .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
what we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . and by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosoph@@ y , the project that begins in wonder -- what kant called &quot; ad@@ mi@@ ration and a@@ we at the star@@ ry sky above and the moral law within . &quot;
everyone &apos;s familiar with cancer , but we don &apos;t normally think of cancer as being a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease .
loy@@ al@@ ty essentially is a micro@@ -@@ economy .
he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s the electron@@ ic commer@@ ce network . &quot;
it &apos;s what &apos;s known as a biol@@ umines@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ arm , and just like the al@@ arm on your car or your house , it &apos;s meant to cast un@@ wanted attention onto the in@@ tru@@ der , there@@ by either le@@ ading to his capture or sc@@ aring him away .
we know these international standards work because we &apos;ve already got one .
we &apos;ve got a choice before us .
the ju@@ dge on the case , ju@@ dge lo@@ is for@@ er thought that this made no sense .
the way that silicon beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build transi@@ stors , is a pur@@ ely quantum phenomen@@ on .
so what is this bi@@ zar@@ re architecture con@@ figuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual ?
and you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s this one little last bit that &apos;s still rema@@ ining red .
ro@@ ger . i got &apos; em .
they haven &apos;t seen anything , ok , but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction streng@@ th of these dark matter particles are .
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east , i have never been as optimi@@ stic as i am today that the gap between the muslim world and the west is nar@@ ro@@ wing fast , and one of the many reasons for my optimis@@ m is that , because i know there are millions , hundreds of millions of people , muslims like that old ima@@ m in tun@@ is , who are re@@ cla@@ im@@ ing this word and re@@ stor@@ ing to its original , beautiful pur@@ pose .
here we have the descri@@ ption of the order of nature .
i didn &apos;t know a single person .
and my lung collap@@ sed , so somebody cut me open and put a p@@ in in there as well to stop that cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c event from happening .
you see the geni@@ ality of his creation , right directly on the ground layer of the pan@@ el , and see this cool thing , finding , i should rather say , an elephant . because of this elephant , over 70 new images came out , never seen for centuries .
there are 200 million t@@ wee@@ ts being po@@ sted every day .
what &apos;s the fundamental problem we have in de@@ aling with these social problems ?
it does seem really hard to get consum@@ ers to do the right thing .
that &apos;s social . let &apos;s look at education .
maybe i &apos;m wrong . &quot;
we then take a sc@@ aff@@ old that we shape like a bla@@ d@@ der .
don &apos;t give in to the wall .
&quot; and fur@@ ther@@ more , it is the thought that coun@@ ts . &quot;
so when a plant is thir@@ sty , it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like twitter .
we thought the hit@@ t@@ ing-@@ it@@ -@@ out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the-@@ box number was 1@@ 50,000 nets a year .
what are the things that they all do ?
for me it was a new discovery .
you need to .
you see , the battery is the key en@@ ab@@ ling device here .
suther@@ land wanted to create a system where ideas didn &apos;t just per@@ col@@ ate down but could per@@ col@@ ate up from the bottom and be ad@@ ju@@ sted in real time .
but i guess the other thing to add is , if you do have emplo@@ ye@@ es , and you do have a company , i think you have certain responsi@@ bili@@ ties to demon@@ strate that you are thinking ahead for them , and you are trying to plan .
so in a sense , bur@@ sty we@@ blogs coming from new voices .
so what brings the different enti@@ ties to the table ?
and my m@@ um said , &quot; dar@@ ling , remember that you can &apos;t see and you can &apos;t feel the picture and you can &apos;t feel the print on the page . &quot;
but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing , and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other .
so let &apos;s start in the united k@@ ing@@ dom , since that &apos;s where we are today .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cell@@ ular mechan@@ ics .
computers ! what about computers ?
but people &apos;s expec@@ tations for their future went up significantly .
dan den@@ ne@@ tt : see the sha@@ do@@ ws going back and forth ? pretty big .
and when i walked in , she was already at the table .
and i haven &apos;t the sli@@ ght@@ est idea of what it does or what it &apos;s good for , but i want it .
ok , everybody imagine books and imagine just te@@ aring out the pages .
so the el@@ ders gave me some very sound and profound ad@@ vice .
do you know what this was right here ?
it &apos;s se@@ man@@ tic represent@@ ation of com@@ ment , content , and what you can really think of x@@ m@@ l in this case , is it &apos;s the pack@@ aging that we &apos;re putting around these pages .
you can do this in groups as well .
what then of man@@ ned space exploration ?
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex@@ -@@ offen@@ ders re-@@ off@@ end within five years .
and then he went on , and then he turned to me and said , &quot; you &apos;re an american .
and this student , probably the first time using it , but she can artic@@ u@@ late it many different ways .
the other people , i ad@@ ded an u@@ gly version of tom .
unlike the occu@@ pan@@ ts of the universe , the universe itself is not waste@@ ful .
even our near@@ est star , the sun -- its emissions suff@@ er the tyran@@ ny of light speed .
because in the last four years we &apos;ve seen all kinds of me@@ mes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page .
so let &apos;s look at how china is re-@@ estab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that hierarch@@ y in the far east .
so if i now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a magnetic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance .
what you &apos;re getting is a range of smaller conver@@ sations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a bro@@ ader concept of the environment .
india still has a long way to go to catch up with china .
on the contr@@ ary , do@@ od@@ ling should be le@@ ver@@ aged in precisely those situations where information den@@ sity is very high and the need for process@@ ing that information is very high .
it &apos;s a system of systems .
for example , the el@@ ev@@ ators in this building most likely are controll@@ ed by one of these .
and i think an even more wonderful spe@@ ech , which i &apos;m going to read a big ch@@ unk of , which sums up what i said at the beginning about believ@@ ing there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and measure than money .
what we do is make a very simple electric motor .
but then he goes and cham@@ pi@@ ons laws like the in@@ famous &quot; three-@@ stri@@ kes &quot; law that would dis@@ connect citizens from the internet for fi@@ le sharing , which has been con@@ dem@@ ned by the u.@@ n@@ . special ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur on freedom of expression as being a dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate viol@@ ation of citizens &apos; right to communic@@ ations , and has rais@@ ed questions am@@ ong@@ st civil society groups about whether some political represent@@ a@@ tives are more interested in pres@@ er@@ ving the interests of the enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment industry than they are in defen@@ ding the rights of their citizens .
we can take it completely for granted .
and i was very lucky .
well , the reason it &apos;s such a bad job is that there &apos;s somebody sho@@ ot@@ ing at you a lot of the time .
he clo@@ ses it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen st@@ af@@ f .
if this were bat@@ t@@ le@@ star gal@@ ac@@ tica and you &apos;re fighting the cy@@ l@@ ons , don &apos;t hi@@ de behind the black hole .
and that &apos;s really how i became an entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r . &quot;
i don &apos;t . nor , i suspe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
we did the family equivalent of a corpo@@ rate re@@ treat .
i promis@@ e she read that text .
you know , we can make o@@ zone from car tail@@ pi@@ pes .
as i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces , the same process in a small@@ -@@ scale version that helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun and even this very planet .
we &apos;ve all heard of the casu@@ al fri@@ day thing .
rock@@ ett : it &apos;s like i &apos;m just wa@@ king up , you know ?
her father the king said , &quot; who will mar@@ ry a whist@@ ling prin@@ cess ? &quot;
now , how do i do this , and where do i do this , and all of that sort of thing .
and this en@@ ables us to distingu@@ ish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries . so why shouldn &apos;t we say they have the same symmetries ?
now what about goals ? where are we going toward ?
this is an area way outside the national park , stre@@ t@@ ching out into all these very de@@ gra@@ ded lands .
so , that &apos;s sort of to put it in perspective here .
and if we can main@@ tain the more positive fe@@ el@@ ings about the past , that becomes the new nor@@ m .
in china , recy@@ cl@@ ing is a major issue .
then half of them announ@@ ced their com@@ mit@@ ment to this goal to the room , and half didn &apos;t .
and we were pretty much just over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with interest from people who wanted a k@@ it that they could build this open ro@@ v themselves .
and one of the things he &apos;s really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason , but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value .
the only thing they &apos;re missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going .
we get over 50@@ 0,000 unique vis@@ it@@ ors per month , just to our particular site .
when you have trees , the root system holds the water .
this is the view looking down the hu@@ d@@ son river , with manhattan on the left , and new jer@@ se@@ y out on the right , looking out toward the atlantic ocean .
but in fact he was the person who was most su@@ sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to the oxygen .
scre@@ w you . go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well .
so , what is it for ?
our vision is to introduce this whole new real@@ m of human interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do , but it can also respond to your fac@@ ial expres@@ sions and emotional experi@@ ences .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sex@@ y and elegant , it &apos;s hid@@ den .
we are on the ver@@ ge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
they don &apos;t necessarily even have to go into some kind of for@@ mal work@@ shop to do it .
so an important bi@@ om@@ imi@@ cry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in sym@@ bio@@ tic clu@@ sters .
and so it &apos;s wonderful for us to think intelle@@ ctu@@ ally about how the life of the world is , and especially those who are very smart -- we can play this game in our head .
and so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing center -- publi@@ sh@@ ing center , is what we called it -- and a writing center .
would the discovery of an older cultural civili@@ zation out there inspi@@ re us to find ways to survive our increasingly un@@ certain technological adoles@@ cence ?
ch@@ au@@ v@@ et ca@@ ves are about 3@@ 2,000 years old , along with a few small , reali@@ stic sculp@@ tures of women and animals from the same period .
you might be surprised having seen klei@@ ber as such a hyper@@ active guy .
is the hi@@ ja@@ b or the head@@ scar@@ f a symbol of sub@@ mission or resi@@ stance ?
but we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . it &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
anyway these women sat in front of an x-ray device .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sta@@ ying in a hotel down@@ town .
in geor@@ gi@@ a , after years of stal@@ e@@ mate , we saw a ful@@ l-@@ scale res@@ ur@@ gen@@ ce of violence in au@@ gu@@ st , 2008 .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &apos;s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else &apos;s car .
this is a photo that i made showing one of these pu@@ ps that &apos;s only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the um@@ bili@@ cal cor@@ d on its bel@@ ly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is fran@@ tically trying to push it up to brea@@ the and to get it back to st@@ able pur@@ ch@@ ase .
phili@@ p zim@@ bar@@ do : let &apos;s tun@@ e into the conversation of the princi@@ p@@ als in ada@@ m &apos;s temp@@ tation .
so i work in mark@@ eting , which i love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when i had a little less gra@@ y hair .
and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , ra@@ v@@ i d@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from pe@@ p@@ s@@ i , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
it was so tra@@ gic .
and the others say , no , five bas@@ ket@@ ball &#91; cour@@ ts &#93; .
can you feel the rage ?
you can &apos;t mis@@ s it when i tell you what &apos;s there .
he started it just two weeks ago .
what are we seeing ?
it &apos;s like s@@ kin@@ boar@@ ding .
but i was not limited when i s@@ ang , and as air came up from my l@@ ungs , through my vo@@ cal cor@@ ds and passed my li@@ ps as sound , it was the closest thing i had ever come to tran@@ scen@@ dence .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 7@@ 0-@@ year-old women playing bridge .
extremely , extremely isol@@ ated .
i see a white building . it &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing , a soft snow .
sand , water , all the equi@@ p@@ ment we don &apos;t need anymore .
now , there &apos;s another fat@@ ty ac@@ id , cap@@ ric ac@@ id , which is just like the other two , except that it has two more carbon atoms .
so i &apos;m watching this behavior in the class@@ room , and what do i notice ? i notice that m@@ ba students really exhi@@ bit the full range of power non@@ verb@@ als .
ok , who hasn &apos;t v@@ oted yet ? because that &apos;s really n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty -- i said you had to .
i think that without perhaps being able to name it , we are colle@@ ctively experi@@ encing that we &apos;ve come as far as we can with toler@@ ance as our only gui@@ ding virtu@@ e .
today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals .
this is the ex@@ tent of the work that &apos;s to be comple@@ ted by 2010 .
mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation , and he made the case that scientific disco@@ ver@@ ies are r@@ ar@@ ely the product of one individual &apos;s geni@@ us .
like for instance , this is a google share of the ted conference .
those magne@@ ts are in there .
and that is a wonderful thing there .
i mean , is there a scale to it , at the small@@ est scale , or ... ?
what &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the marsh@@ mal@@ low and go like this ...
it has also chimpanze@@ es .
you get one of these bal@@ lot forms at ran@@ dom , and then you go into the vot@@ ing bo@@ oth , and you mark your choices , and you te@@ ar along a perfor@@ ation .
the truck they go on tour with .
i don &apos;t even know why they make me s@@ low down , but something pul@@ ls me like a mag@@ net and then i ignore all the others , and i just go to that pain@@ ting .
it was an un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x up@@ bringing , but as a kid on the streets of new york , you learn how to trust your own instin@@ cts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
this has cru@@ cial impli@@ cations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
and you can start to get the best arti@@ stic dire@@ ctors , scen@@ ic designers and ac@@ tors from around the country to come to per@@ form here because you can do things you can &apos;t do el@@ se@@ where .
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible ted@@ talks .
on the side facing the street it &apos;s much more normal , except i sli@@ pped a few man@@ sar@@ ds down , so that coming on the point , these hou@@ sing units made a gest@@ ure to the corner .
and here &apos;s the really al@@ ar@@ ming part : we don &apos;t fully understand the long-term impact of multiple in@@ ju@@ ries .
so he moved back to the farm , and , long story short , they now have seven ac@@ res under cul@@ tiv@@ ation .
at 15 minutes i was suffering major o@@ 2 de@@ pri@@ vation to the heart .
people agree that pain@@ t@@ ings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures deter@@ mine a uni@@ form@@ ity of aes@@ thetic ta@@ ste .
and they clearly che@@ ated in a very , very serious way .
so this is not a zer@@ o-@@ sum game in anyway .
in south africa , they have a phrase called u@@ bun@@ tu .
i was a south indian brought up in ben@@ gal .
the bu@@ yer was ki@@ p for@@ bes , son of one of the most fl@@ am@@ bo@@ y@@ ant million@@ air@@ es of the 20th century .
and for me as a cur@@ ator , i felt proud . i felt i &apos;d shi@@ fted the nee@@ d@@ le a little .
now , when your eye moves from eye to eye , if there was something else there like , a no@@ se , you &apos;d see a no@@ se where an eye is supposed to be , and you &apos;d go , oh sh@@ it , you know -- there &apos;s something wrong about this person .
i talked there , what , two weeks ago , something like that .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
so , here you go .
it can improve health , and it can play a part in reducing , if not elimin@@ ating , poverty .
the psych@@ ologists mar@@ gar@@ et marsh@@ all and john brown studied students with high and low expec@@ tations .
he : almost none .
but based on the actual -- you know , being able to talk to them , and to see their recor@@ ds , this is what it looks like in terms of the wa@@ ges .
and i said , &quot; look , i think i &apos;ll sc@@ are the grandmother to death , if i actually write to her and tell her that you &apos;re willing to adop@@ t her , i want to go back and talk to her . &quot;
one reporter who was watching our program in som@@ ali@@ a about five years ago -- a place which has er@@ adi@@ cated polio , not once , but twice , because they got rein@@ fe@@ cted .
nothing can do that . and i talk next . i showed them this video with the simple design of rhe@@ x here . and just to convince them we should go to mars in 2011 , i tin@@ ted the video or@@ ange just to give them the sense of being on mars .
and it &apos;s ju@@ lian bi@@ gel@@ o@@ w who was running it until mi@@ d@@ night when the machine was offici@@ ally turned off .
so , how do we make and understand metaph@@ ors ?
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the sna@@ ke river in i@@ da@@ h@@ o .
this is about consum@@ ers working together to get what they want out of the mark@@ et@@ place .
this is an old bicycle tube , which gives you a bro@@ ad ru@@ b@@ ber band , two safety p@@ ins .
does anybody know why ?
and they can feed that information back to their sub@@ scri@@ bers , but only to their sub@@ scri@@ bers on the same highway located behind the traffic ja@@ m !
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without wor@@ r@@ ying about creating noise or avo@@ i@@ ding t@@ all buildings .
four sleep in one twin bed , and three sleep on the mu@@ d and lin@@ o@@ le@@ um floor .
and who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
it tries to affect people .
we said , &quot; our little experiment has been a success .
a@@ v : so tab@@ o@@ o number three : you can &apos;t talk about your mis@@ car@@ riage -- but today i &apos;ll talk about mine .
robert gor@@ don : the death of innovation , the end of growth
it &apos;s quite dangerous , but i believe it &apos;s better to have dangerous things in the open than think you &apos;re going to keep them secret .
and because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
it &apos;s pretty anno@@ ying for the fis@@ her@@ men .
i work with vi@@ bra@@ tion .
now , the to@@ aster was huge because they used to make to@@ ast on open fir@@ es , and it took a lot of time and attention .
so , we used the same bla@@ d@@ der@@ -@@ in@@ fl@@ ated system , and we took it for testing .
you can see here , the small planets domin@@ ate the picture .
that &apos;s the qu@@ est .
that if we invol@@ ve them in their education , if we have them discuss the real issues that they con@@ front -- that our whole society con@@ fron@@ ts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world , that magic will happen .
so un@@ reali@@ stic optimis@@ m can lead to ris@@ ky behavior , to financial collap@@ se , to fau@@ l@@ ty plan@@ ning .
now , am i saying that there are du@@ mb people working here ?
that the chinese economy pas@@ ses the u.s. economy in , let &apos;s say , 2030 , which it may it , that will be a measure of total economic size , but not of per cap@@ it@@ a income -- won &apos;t tell you about the com@@ position of the economy .
poor nutri@@ tion , access to water , climate change , de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , lack of skills , inse@@ curity , not enough food , not enough healthcare , pollu@@ tion .
or they &apos;re respon@@ ding to requ@@ ests and concern@@ s by governments that have no j@@ ur@@ is@@ di@@ ction over many , or most , of the us@@ ers and vie@@ wers who are inter@@ acting with the content in question .
y@@ a@@ ho@@ o news , the biggest news site on the internet , is now person@@ alized -- different people get different things .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
now , talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two .
and that needs to be recogni@@ zed , first of all , that peac@@ e@@ keeping works .
another spo@@ ok@@ y proper@@ ty is that it flo@@ ws with absolutely no vis@@ co@@ sity or fri@@ ction , so if you were to take the li@@ d off that bottle , it won &apos;t stay inside .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if i was a museum cur@@ ator , i would make a room for love , a room for gener@@ osity .
if you look at this , just the tube , it is quite bright .
he &apos;s 2@@ 9 years old , very well-@@ built , le@@ an , he &apos;s six-@@ foot , five , wei@@ gh@@ s 2@@ 65 l@@ bs . , and he is down .
or , the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees .
the way to break down the si@@ los is to get inter@@ -@@ oper@@ ability between social net@@ working sites .
the activi@@ sts i intervie@@ wed had nothing in common , literally , except for one thing , which was that they all c@@ ited their mothers as their most lo@@ om@@ ing and important activ@@ ist influ@@ ences .
it &apos;s going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that .
people i know who are fire@@ men told me that this is not un@@ common .
i &apos;d designed a lot of cha@@ irs , over the years for tra@@ ctors and tru@@ cks and sub@@ mar@@ ines -- all kinds of things .
and he knew very intui@@ tively , that best practic@@ es , developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india .
this is a point cloud .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely hel@@ p@@ ful .
at that point , he asked to be pa@@ ged into his wife .
i was the fre@@ ak of the family .
i look a little like mo@@ ses , or ted k@@ ac@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
why do trans@@ national extrem@@ ist organi@@ zations succeed where democra@@ tic mov@@ ements have a harder time taking hold ? ma@@ a@@ j@@ id na@@ wa@@ z , a former islam@@ ist extrem@@ ist , as@@ ks for new gras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots stories and global social activ@@ ism to spread democracy in the face of national@@ ism and x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . a powerful talk from ted@@ global 2011 .
so how many hours of the day does that take ?
all that you need to do , all that the eli@@ tes need to do , is to move this operation into something that is en@@ closed so that the operation can be made more efficient .
a new appreci@@ ation for the privilege that we have of under@@ taking this challenge .
and the idea was to put mc@@ sweeney &apos;s -- mc@@ sweeney &apos;s quar@@ ter@@ ly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other maga@@ zin@@ es -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
we heard that now from the east again the war started , and it &apos;s going fast .
if you want to choose to pun@@ ch that pun@@ ch card clock , you actually age me .
let &apos;s go back to traditional far@@ ming .
starting about 198@@ 7 they &apos;re both going down a lot .
i mean , it &apos;s a nice top@@ ic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your pe@@ ers is something different .
so where do you get sam@@ ples from for your genetic analysis ?
paris hil@@ ton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little hand@@ ba@@ g , until a drop cro@@ c land@@ ed on her .
i &apos;ve been in the audience .
you know , we &apos;ve heard that this week -- this roman@@ tic notion of the l@@ one geni@@ us with the &quot; eu@@ re@@ ka ! &quot; moment that changes the world is mis@@ le@@ ading .
now in our case , although it wasn &apos;t necess@@ ary , we could also actually map the network of the students .
thank you .
if you have money , of course , you can get the value .
so we don &apos;t know that much about the history of viol@@ ini@@ sts but we do know that when we enter@@ ed the state of new jer@@ se@@ y there is an up@@ ti@@ ck in violence .
so the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society .
these guys were running an operation called i@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ u@@ . , a cyber@@ crime operation through which they ne@@ tt@@ ed millions .
i thought , what a great way to get to school .
basically , you make an am@@ pli@@ fication in the lab , and then you get it to self-@@ assem@@ ble into a structure like a battery .
all of this effort results in an in@@ ert object .
that &apos;s somehow un@@ professional and bad .
he said , &quot; yeah , hey , it &apos;s mel@@ ting . yeah , the sul@@ fu@@ r &apos;s mel@@ ting .
so we trained them to be able to do three separate words , to la@@ y out them proper@@ ly .
and i basically live my life in sort of a trance , and i look around and everything i see is just the beginning of a long story .
and what it is , is working with both positive and negative space but also with these cur@@ ves .
they meant to rule by means of repres@@ sion .
you &apos;ve probably heard of ben@@ zene r@@ ings ; they &apos;re very car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic .
she &apos;s about to let me know she &apos;s too frustrated with me .
when i asked her if she fe@@ ared anything , or whether she would mis@@ s anything from ma@@ th@@ are , she said , &quot; what would i fear that i haven &apos;t con@@ fron@@ ted already ?
it &apos;s called the world church of god .
i felt the th@@ ri@@ ll of reali@@ zation when i knew i &apos;d come upon the answer .
and that is going to change our world@@ view in a profound way -- not in a dis@@ similar way as 400 years ago , c@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus &apos; act did , by changing the way we view space and time .
i &apos;ll ask a couple of my sons to set up the can@@ v@@ ases here .
at first , we were safe in the camp .
i &apos;ve left out error corre@@ ction and a bunch of other things .
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising .
many of you have probably used this .
thank you .
actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at star@@ bucks , that i insi@@ sted that i wasn &apos;t having col@@ om@@ bi@@ an coffee ; the coffee was actually pre@@ -@@ colum@@ bi@@ an .
man wi@@ sh@@ es to be happy , only wi@@ sh@@ es to be happy , and cannot wish not to be so .
but if you think about it , from my head to my hands to his leg .
they were either born into or they pro@@ ac@@ tively surro@@ unded themselves with the right people .
they still are an aw@@ fully arro@@ gant group of people , i will as@@ sure you , but they &apos;re now arro@@ gant about their im@@ parti@@ ality , and they , too , see a tremendous range of potential out@@ comes .
and i realized that , in order to know where i was going , i had to know where i &apos;d been .
i believe this has got to be , in part , a building ec@@ ology problem .
so , you know , by being able to write a genome and plu@@ g it into an organis@@ m , the software , if you will , changes the hard@@ ware .
so what he says is , very often , is like this : he says , &quot; he tells me , he tells me , before he passed , that he had trouble brea@@ thing . &quot;
you know , eight hours before de@@ ad@@ line , four archite@@ cts trying to get this building in on time , right ?
think about it . really bring it to mind . this is important .
the third question is , why is it hot@@ ter in summer than in winter ?
you were separ@@ ated from your family and plac@@ ed into mother and baby homes .
we &apos;re able to drive down area 25 , down to a more normal level , and we &apos;re able to turn back online the fron@@ tal lo@@ bes of the brain , and indeed we &apos;re seeing very stri@@ king results in these patients with sever@@ e depression .
and i would be very interested to get your respon@@ ses to this .
and because these are artists , they have very arti@@ stic temper@@ am@@ ents .
the maj@@ ority of the planet , as@@ pir@@ ing for development , having the right for development , are in large as@@ pir@@ ing for an un@@ sustainable lifest@@ yle , a mom@@ ent@@ ous pressure .
these are the tun@@ a , the bil@@ l@@ fish and the sharks .
in 190@@ 8 , just a 200@@ -@@ foot piece of a com@@ et explo@@ ded over si@@ ber@@ ia and fl@@ atten@@ ed forests for maybe 100 miles .
is she thinking about me ? is she thinking about others ? &quot;
can you sing , please , the first no@@ te of don gi@@ o@@ van@@ n@@ i ?
it was 1.@@ 4@@ 8 .
phr@@ ases and s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts taken out of context in what i call the &quot; high@@ li@@ ghter version , &quot; which is the one favor@@ ed by both muslim fundament@@ ali@@ sts and anti-@@ muslim islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bes .
what do i wear ?
but what you might not know is that you &apos;re also beam@@ ing out a list of networks you &apos;ve pre@@ vi@@ ously connected to , even when you &apos;re not using wir@@ eless ac@@ tively .
heads up is specific to conc@@ ussion in kids .
and it &apos;s no wonder that as we head into the writers &apos; stri@@ ke , odd things happen .
but i can go on about telling you how we evol@@ ve stories , and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get transl@@ ated into the particular discipl@@ ine that i am in , which is film .
you know , we have all these g@@ aps and i think we like our g@@ aps because they make us feel like we identify with something , some smaller community .
what we didn &apos;t anti@@ ci@@ pate was the many , many other uses that would evol@@ ve from this very simple system .
rhe@@ x &apos;s foot started off to be quite simple , then it got tun@@ ed over time , and ultimately resul@@ ted in this half circle .
the problem is he doesn &apos;t exist .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we don &apos;t .
my father had been in a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c car accident , and he died .
this is the ma@@ ster@@ mind behind the eventu@@ al passage of what we call the son@@ ny bon@@ o copy@@ right term exten@@ sion act , exten@@ ding the term of exi@@ sting copy@@ rights by 20 years , so that no one could do to dis@@ ney what dis@@ ney did to the brothers gri@@ mm .
make sure everybody knows that i got the answer right , because this is my big fin@@ ish , ok .
and then it wir@@ es itself to the current colle@@ ctor .
and it has the it@@ ur@@ i forest itself -- about 1,@@ 300 species of plants , so far known .
but more and more people in the united states are taking them long term .
it &apos;s going towards india , not from india .
b@@ l : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
and i said , &quot; this car here &apos;s got one licen@@ se pla@@ te that &apos;s all cru@@ m@@ pl@@ ed up . &quot;
this is why we give bon@@ uses to ban@@ kers and pay in all kinds of ways .
and it &apos;s then being ri@@ pped open .
i love conne@@ ctions .
and i then became a de@@ progra@@ mmer .
okay , so how would i like to fin@@ ish ?
after one performance , i could bar@@ ely dra@@ g myself from the stage to the ta@@ xic@@ ab .
so this idea of har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing focused ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und to treat les@@ i@@ ons in the brain is not new at all .
because in reality , what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wo@@ und , and you have a scan@@ ner , basically like a fl@@ at@@ bed scan@@ ner .
but you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; new &quot; emerging from the &quot; old . &quot;
we can do the same for ge@@ other@@ mal energy and solar power .
it &apos;s because i didn &apos;t have a self to get in the way .
i have s@@ w@@ um in front of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers which have re@@ treated so much .
and why not ?
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe i saw a hon@@ ey bee or it occur@@ red to my mind that if i only could be like the hon@@ ey bee , life would be wonderful .
com@@ man@@ der : soldi@@ ers , you are going to fight a battle , so you must get ready and willing to die .
just moving on , is it possible , taking that idea of mind , body , bo@@ d@@ y-@@ building , to sup@@ plant the first body , the biological body , with the second , the body of architecture and the built environment .
i mean , that &apos;s all i heard growing up .
yet the assu@@ mp@@ tions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predi@@ ctions are so myster@@ ious that even feynman himself was moved to re@@ mark , &quot; if you think you understand quantum theory , you don &apos;t understand quantum theory . &quot;
you really have to do work to figure out , well , one option &apos;s a thousand , 2,000 ; one is 1,500 .
and i think we know that love is res@@ ili@@ ent enough for us to get out there and try .
and i said , well , in the same way that they ex@@ u@@ de a protein and it starts the cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zation -- and then they all sort of le@@ an@@ ed in -- they let go of a protein that stop@@ s the cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zation .
see , i want you to think about just how specific this is .
then , this fau@@ c@@ et here is just a piece of o@@ sage or@@ ange .
we &apos;re looking at milli@@ meter accu@@ ra@@ cy with reg@@ ard to spa@@ tial and milli@@ second accu@@ ra@@ cy using 3@@ 0@@ 6 s@@ qui@@ ds -- these are super@@ condu@@ cting quantum inter@@ ference devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking .
right ? it can happen in the stock market .
but it is a story of effort and struggle against im@@ prob@@ abilities .
and i believe it &apos;s because technology appe@@ als to us most where we are most vulnerable .
and she was horri@@ fied to get there and find that they didn &apos;t have a toi@@ let .
in fact , most of the people studying biol@@ umines@@ cence today are focused on the chemistry , because these chemicals have pro@@ ved so incredibly valuable for developing anti@@ bac@@ teri@@ al ag@@ ents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life on mars , dete@@ cting pollu@@ tan@@ ts in our waters -- which is how we use it at or@@ ca .
and that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
but in the non-@@ muslim communities of the middle east , such as some chri@@ stian communities , eastern communities , you see the same practice .
we were tran@@ scen@@ ding the space between the mind and the device .
i felt , when i had my photographs , that i was holding on to something true , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of agen@@ das or politics .
that if we keep putting things , through industrial and urban exi@@ st@@ ence , back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .
but they &apos;re very ke@@ en that we don &apos;t let money drop into that relationship , else it turns into something like this .
the good news is that the same technology that allowed mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation of electron@@ ics is now allo@@ wing us to mini@@ at@@ uri@@ ze biological laborat@@ ories .
there i &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
thank you .
and i will say , though , the museum is gor@@ geous .
not quite ten percent .
how do you cross your legs in a san@@ e way ?
i built , along with my two brothers , the le@@ ading real est@@ ate company in my home state , ker@@ al@@ a , and then worked profession@@ ally with two of india &apos;s biggest busin@@ ess@@ men , but in their star@@ tu@@ p enter@@ pris@@ es .
so we went on and we looked in wikipedia , we found this map .
seven , and yours ? seven .
he said he recor@@ ded many long hours in various in@@ ton@@ ations to be used in the voice .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
but it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
and per@@ chance , if you can always keep this picture in your mind , that when we conven@@ e maybe in the dist@@ ant future , in 2020 , that picture will look very different .
i &apos;m a convi@@ ct ; i am br@@ and@@ ed &apos; wrong . &apos; what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
she bought a bright red kar@@ mann g@@ hi@@ a with the money she made working at bur@@ ger king .
and we approach this problem by consi@@ dering another curi@@ ous syn@@ dro@@ me called phan@@ tom limb .
if i took a bi@@ te out of it , you &apos;d go , &quot; wait a second .
yes , there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv , to find an effective vac@@ cine for malaria , to find a diagno@@ stic tool that works for t@@ .b. , but i believe that we o@@ we it to those who will@@ ingly and sel@@ fl@@ ess@@ ly con@@ sent to partici@@ pate in these clinical tri@@ als to do this in a human@@ e way .
so one thing that i took from home is this notion that edu@@ cat@@ ors don &apos;t necessarily have to teach .
it &apos;s all been too much for him .
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genoci@@ de or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ gely con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issue .
we &apos;re living through one of those moments .
we don &apos;t want to show the video games with the par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a . no ar@@ ca@@ de no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
thir@@ dly , variation in temp@@ o .
we connect the dots : a is connected to b ; b is connected to c .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about and really , how do we get from where we are now to where we need to go ?
of course the political agen@@ das in the world has been very ob@@ s@@ essed , pol@@ ari@@ zing the two against each other into different , very nor@@ ma@@ tive ideas .
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olymp@@ ics .
i &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mor@@ n@@ ings .
pro@@ mot@@ ing recy@@ cl@@ ing , things like gar@@ den-@@ share , that mat@@ ches up people who don &apos;t have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gar@@ den@@ s they aren &apos;t using anymore .
one area is called experiment@@ al econom@@ ics . the other area is called behavi@@ oral econom@@ ics .
but it turns out they were very un@@ popular .
so , it &apos;s a sol@@ ved problem , that particular problem is sol@@ ved .
so this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of ri@@ ght@@ ness .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i hadn &apos;t realized that the hiv / aids pande@@ mic was directly affe@@ cting women in such a way .
one is dead , one is alive . that must be ne@@ cro@@ phili@@ a .
i &apos;m also interested in birds . and i &apos;m familiar with this fellow . this is a rather special bird .
ak : well , it was a little difficult , because all i had to work with was a bi@@ c@@ ep and a tri@@ c@@ ep .
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin par@@ sing the world is dynamic information .
you &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleagu@@ e &apos;s brain .
if i ask you to think of their sym@@ b@@ ols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately .
okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and res@@ cu@@ e it .
it must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to t@@ ack@@ le one of the most important questions in neuro@@ science : how are the brains of men and women different ?
i actually shared that with some leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors here in the u.s .
because they are also a part of us .
the cle@@ an@@ er came into the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue .
the inter@@ ior of green@@ land is to the right .
it is ab@@ undance , as opposed to scar@@ city .
and we can move forward from there , and really get somewhere .
and there is almost nothing we can do about it , asi@@ de from taking a rul@@ er and starting to measure it .
they have very sophi@@ st@@ icated co@@ operation .
force them to help others .
the answer was absolutely yes .
a few bring out 100,000 dollars each .
so once again , why do we take these crazy ris@@ ks with the preci@@ ous ?
what happens is that the second this introdu@@ ction of in@@ cen@@ tive gets us so that instead of asking , &quot; what is my responsibility ? &quot;
the kids are happy , and they love it .
make kil@@ ler apps , if you will .
thank you .
i like it .
just a bit too or@@ nam@@ ent@@ al .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly large telescope .
today most people recognize ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan as an emerging ge@@ o@@ political player . why ?
on the other hand , we &apos;re working with berk@@ shi@@ re ha@@ th@@ away , war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ ett and sha@@ w car@@ pet , the largest car@@ pet company in the world .
it can be beautiful . it can reve@@ al quite aston@@ ishing things .
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
first of all , it &apos;s a linear proje@@ ction .
i am banking on you and i &apos;m banking on guys like her@@ bie and qu@@ in@@ cy and hack@@ ett and richard and very de@@ cent people who still believe in something .
today , the european union is busy trans@@ fer@@ ring aid .
and so , there &apos;s very interesting ca@@ ve real est@@ ate on mars , at least of that type .
when i was growing up , my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in canada .
hu@@ h ? maybe google would hi@@ re this .
so again this is what they can see under the micro@@ scop@@ e .
well , there are many reasons , and you heard some of them in the short talk today .
and you can see them working in all parts of the city .
and so we met dr. son@@ o k@@ han@@ gh@@ aran@@ i in paki@@ stan .
we &apos;ve made a fascinating discovery : there &apos;s nothing wrong with the kids that affe@@ ction and s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine and food and enthusias@@ m and her@@ bie &apos;s music can &apos;t cure .
probably not .
and it has no dna .
and then lei@@ lei -- i know his other name -- told us about inter@@ connection , and how we &apos;re all totally inter@@ connected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other . and of course in the buddh@@ ist universe , we &apos;ve already done this already billions of times in many , many life@@ times in the past .
no , what i want to do is take you back to 18@@ 5@@ 4 in london for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in brie@@ f -- of this out@@ break , which in many ways , i think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who suff@@ ered in a pre@@ -@@ civil rights america , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ ator of the day .
the through@@ put rate right now is 1.@@ 5 million nets , three million by the end of the year .
what do we know about the death thre@@ ats by the taliban na@@ iled on the do@@ ors of the people who d@@ are to send their dau@@ gh@@ ters to school as in bal@@ k@@ h ?
while i was working at the u.@@ n@@ . , i met this girl . her name is lau@@ ren bush .

the enzy@@ mes re@@ manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red the hydro@@ carb@@ ons into car@@ bo@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates -- fung@@ al sug@@ ars .
it &apos;s been an incredible few days .
it was en@@ ding up in land@@ fil@@ ls .
they sent a search party , and i over@@ heard people saying they wish i had killed myself , jump@@ ed off bi@@ ble pe@@ ak .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
just like jordan and so many other ma@@ kers , han@@ na@@ h published her reci@@ pes and allows anyone to copy and re@@ produce them .
he kept it to himself for 30 years .
animals too .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are -- it &apos;s kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
the an@@ c@@ est@@ or of the modern corpo@@ ration , the city of london corpo@@ ration , exi@@ sted in the 12@@ th century .
well , let &apos;s think about the drug scre@@ ening process for a moment .
throughout her life she had been he@@ ating water with fire@@ wood , and she had hand was@@ hed la@@ undry for seven children .
so in fact , we found the same identical conditions , we re@@ constru@@ cted the entire thing again , he came out with an entire bri@@ ga@@ de of sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s offic@@ ers to protect him in this community , all right ?
we are tra@@ ding lessons on everything from su@@ shi@@ -@@ making to co@@ ding on sk@@ ill@@ share , and we &apos;re even sharing our pe@@ ts on do@@ g@@ vac@@ a@@ y .
you can buy a machine today for about $ 300 that you can create yourself , which is quite incredible .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that sli@@ p@@ per@@ y slo@@ pe to that dangerous , sc@@ ary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consci@@ ously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it .
the second question is , what does the blo@@ go@@ sphere actually do for us , in terms of ac@@ cess@@ ing collective intelligence ?
so , you can see that what we have on this ax@@ is here is size of family . one , two , three , four , five children per woman on this ax@@ is .
let &apos;s s@@ low it down and you can see the sp@@ ines in action .
text : you can say a story is fabri@@ cated .
and his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
a pra@@ g@@ matic partic@@ le , that &apos;s what lo@@ l has gradu@@ ally become .
i think that &apos;s why this is called a head@@ -@@ moun@@ ted proje@@ ctor , isn &apos;t it ?
and then we walked out onto the ice .
but i think when you guys start buying ti@@ ckets and flying sub-@@ orbital fli@@ ghts to space , very soon -- wait a minute , what &apos;s happening here , we &apos;ll have military figh@@ ters with sub-@@ orbital cap@@ ability , and i think very soon this .
which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter , which is absor@@ bing exactly at those frequ@@ en@@ cies .
sho@@ ck , hor@@ ror : now , the re@@ a@@ ders want to be writers and publi@@ sher@@ s .
well , not quite . because darwin was talking about our dist@@ ant ance@@ stry , our common ance@@ stry with ap@@ es .
this is a bit sho@@ cking , because in fact our government is rel@@ ying on that for us to meet k@@ yo@@ to , and do all those kind of things .
if you really want to get a bit closer to swe@@ dis@@ h building standards with a cra@@ pp@@ y house like this , you need to be putting ex@@ tern@@ al insu@@ lation on the building as shown by this block of fl@@ ats in london .
this is basically air@@ -@@ hand@@ ling .
and these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
trans@@ fer@@ red to a larger scale -- actually a lot larger , with a lot of help -- 14@@ ,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 4 bicycle refle@@ ctors -- a 20@@ -@@ day inst@@ all .
now , the third cur@@ ve is information technology .
there &apos;s an i@@ be@@ x in spa@@ in called the bu@@ car@@ do .
and with my al@@ b@@ ani@@ an friends , we tried to stop it , but we fail@@ ed .
people who build this wonderful conc@@ ert hall .
if you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shor@@ test form of the game .
let &apos;s start with business .
one said to me , &quot; our people used to ga@@ ther in caf@@ es to watch football &quot; -- or so@@ c@@ cer , as we say in america -- &quot; and now they ga@@ ther to watch parliament . &quot;
generations go by , somebody says , hey , why don &apos;t we put it on a stick ?
we &apos;re moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system , and we have global decisions to make in this system , decisions about climate , about finance systems , about resources . and think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house , we don &apos;t just go off . i mean , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shi@@ f@@ ting char@@ ity into enter@@ prise .
we find ourselves in the paraly@@ zing gri@@ p of self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive hab@@ its we can &apos;t break .
you bring to the table such enormous process@@ ing power in this do@@ main that you hardly even notice it .
you couldn &apos;t really do pe@@ tty crime , either .
researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species , the larger the ne@@ o@@ cortex , the more likely it is to be de@@ cep@@ tive .
the solution is open source .
&quot; but i &apos;d get to see them in america . &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
and they were people who were not short of wi@@ t , or gra@@ ce or energy , but they had no hope , no jobs , no pro@@ spe@@ cts .
now , those are one-@@ second sam@@ ples of music .
i &apos;ve got a frequ@@ ency coun@@ ter right here .
this is from mc@@ g@@ ill and university of mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an . this is the rhe@@ x , making its first ou@@ ting in a demo .
and so what i have felt -- and i have looked at this from a national security issue -- when i was secre@@ tary of state , i decided that women &apos;s issues had to be central to american foreign policy , not just because i &apos;m a femin@@ ist , but because i believe that societies are better off when women are poli@@ tically and econom@@ ically em@@ powered , that values are passed down , the health situation is better , education is better , there is greater economic pro@@ sper@@ ity .
and so i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a problem that just cri@@ es out for a skelet@@ al system -- not one like this one , but one like this one -- because , func@@ tionally , a skelet@@ on is any system that suppor@@ ts tissue and trans@@ mit@@ s forces .
now we count on the will@@ ing@@ ness of drug companies to make that happen . we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest , not only in the interest of the global good , but also in their own interest , to move from conflict to collabor@@ ation , and through the medi@@ cin@@ es patent pool they can make that happen .
and sometimes military inter@@ vention is necess@@ ary .
so deep , for instance , was abraham lincoln &apos;s love of shakespe@@ are , that he made time to spend more than a hundred ni@@ ghts in the theater , even during those dark days of the war .
almost always , when i &apos;m on tv , the produ@@ cers who call me , who negoti@@ ate what we &apos;re going to say , is a woman .
here &apos;s this guy who got a 3@@ 4@@ -@@ year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are gra@@ p@@ pling with , we as citizens are gra@@ p@@ pling with now . what do we take away ?
i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ance@@ stry .
but even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past , we still make certain kinds of mistakes .
you saw the spray going in .
and there &apos;s five or six different comp@@ il@@ ations there , but each one of those comp@@ il@@ ations refle@@ cts in@@ put from hundreds of these kinds of recor@@ ds from cor@@ als .
we &apos;ve actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab .
and they have strate@@ gi@@ es to keep from over@@ eating , little things that nu@@ dge them away from the table at the right time .
and we have had a spe@@ ak@@ er who said that very thing , and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed a s@@ word right after that , which was quite dra@@ matic .
but it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
you can , once you have all of those different points , you can make it easy for investor@@ s .
18 . so it goes to this lady here .
and the good news is today we are tac@@ kl@@ ing the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
but we can learn to land on these asteroi@@ ds that have our name on them and put something like a small i@@ on pro@@ pul@@ sion motor on it , which would g@@ ently , slowly , after a period of time , push it into a different traject@@ ory , which , if we &apos;ve done our math right , would keep it from hit@@ ting earth .
no@@ wadays people are sitting 9@@ .@@ 3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sle@@ eping , at 7@@ .@@ 7 hours .
next , i do 5@@ 7 squ@@ ared , which is 3@@ ,@@ 249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to co@@ okie , 249 , o@@ op@@ s , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to co@@ okie , 250 plus 7@@ 7 , is 3@@ 2@@ 7 million -- fis@@ sion , fis@@ sion , ok , finally , we do 6@@ 8@@ 3 squ@@ ared , that &apos;s 7@@ 00 times 6@@ 6@@ 6 , plus 17 squ@@ ared is 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 9 , re@@ v up if i need it , re@@ v up , take the 4@@ 6@@ 6 , add that to fis@@ sion , to get , oh ge@@ e -- 3@@ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 9 .
people were not cur@@ ing cancer or building bri@@ d@@ ges .
but i must say , this whole thing about being slightly bor@@ ed all the time , that is what -- i think that is a very important thing for a fashi@@ on designer .
part of my interest in this , i have to say , is that i would like to -- how do i put this poli@@ tely ? -- change the way , or maybe ev@@ is@@ cer@@ ate , the capital structure of the u.s. health care system , which i think is fundamentally broken .
you know , this country is involved as we &apos;ve all heard , in this great healthcare debate .
can you imagine , at every star@@ bucks that you can also get con@@ dom@@ s ?
so what &apos;s going on ?
sam har@@ ris : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , watching the clock ti@@ cking , but the question is : what is volun@@ tary in a context where men have certain expec@@ tations , and you &apos;re guaran@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ eil yourself ?
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
so i &apos;m just going to put that in there .
le@@ ctures , proble@@ m-@@ solving and so on . it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
he said , &quot; gre@@ g , there &apos;s two things i &apos;d like you to do .
one of the sa@@ d@@ dest things about our invol@@ v@@ ement in afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our pri@@ orities out of syn@@ c .
and then an enormous accident took place .
a strange phenomen@@ on .
i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reas@@ sur@@ ing blue hal@@ o .
we can leave the aes@@ thetic ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments to the writers and the spe@@ ak@@ ers .
here &apos;s charles when he was three . so he would be 100 this june .
it f@@ ed the s@@ la@@ ves brought to the anti@@ ll@@ es , the song &quot; ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a far@@ e@@ well &quot; -- &quot; ac@@ ke@@ e rice s@@ alt fish are nice &quot; -- is an em@@ ble@@ m of the importance of s@@ alt co@@ d from nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern canada .
would it give this block of li@@ me@@ stone new proper@@ ties ?
now we &apos;re not there yet .
so why don &apos;t i ask them what helped them succeed , and pass it on to kids ?
if you give children this happy narra@@ tive , you give them the tools to make themselves happ@@ ier .
so this isn &apos;t finished at all , but it &apos;s an on@@ going project where people can continue to collabor@@ ate .
so , before i became a der@@ mat@@ ologist , i started in general medicine , as most der@@ mat@@ ologists do in britain .
so i immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exc@@ la@@ ma@@ tion .
she wasn &apos;t un@@ happy about this . she was res@@ ig@@ ned .
here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me , i must do my best for her .
and this happens to millions of people every year .
there is what op@@ ra@@ h tells us .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intui@@ tion ?
it &apos;s just these two not@@ es in the middle .
one is : why isn &apos;t it happening now ?
and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that ki@@ p@@ p is doing to take inn@@ er-@@ city kids and turn them in the direction of college .
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being u@@ plo@@ ad@@ ed to youtube every single minute .
and it &apos;s a crisis that has its structural fac@@ et -- it &apos;s part@@ ly to do with demo@@ graphi@@ cs .
when the star@@ link dis@@ aster happened , there was a battle between the ep@@ a and the f@@ da over who really had auth@@ ority , and over what parts of this , and they didn &apos;t get it stra@@ ig@@ h@@ ten@@ ed out for months . that &apos;s kind of crazy .
u@@ ma@@ r also has polio .
one day a nasa man@@ ager comes into my office , si@@ ts down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
this one shows the wind potential all around the united states .
when we become insu@@ lin@@ -@@ resi@@ stant , the home@@ o@@ st@@ as@@ is in that balance de@@ vi@@ ates from this state .
but there &apos;s a kind of qu@@ eas@@ iness that these are un@@ natural in some way .
so the train is now pul@@ ling into the third stop along the 6 line .
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work so well anymore either .
and with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the re@@ forms , we put forward a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
the color@@ ing , so color@@ ing ad@@ ds another level to the x-@@ rays .
it &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tou@@ g@@ her than this .
this will take two years .
in these galaxies , especially in a spi@@ ral galaxy like this , most of the mass of the stars is con@@ cent@@ r@@ ated in the middle of the galaxy .
simil@@ arly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechan@@ is@@ ms like ted , and like our relationship with the ob@@ ama white house , with the sen@@ ate , with john ker@@ ry , to influ@@ ence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
there &apos;s a saying in tor@@ a@@ ja that all people will become grand@@ parents , and what this means is that after death , we all become part of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ral line that an@@ ch@@ ors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future .
let me give you the example .
today , stories continue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ ders .
and , the means -- how does he do it ?
some of the cra@@ ck@@ les and po@@ ps were li@@ ght@@ ning , but the e@@ erie whist@@ les and curi@@ ously melo@@ di@@ ous chir@@ ps had a rather more ex@@ o@@ tic orig@@ in .
in a present@@ ation that can only be described as ep@@ ic , com@@ edi@@ an charles flei@@ scher deli@@ vers a hy@@ ster@@ ical sen@@ d-@@ up of a ti@@ me@@ -@@ hon@@ ored theme : the map . geome@@ try , numbers , char@@ ts and stamp art also factor in , as he wea@@ ves together a unique theory of everything called &quot; mole@@ eds . &quot;
you &apos;ll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area , like bar@@ ber@@ shops , c@@ d and dv@@ d stor@@ es , movie the@@ at@@ ers , tail@@ ors , everything is there .
so let &apos;s imagine that our attac@@ ker , called evil hacker just for com@@ e@@ dy value , in@@ ser@@ ts something a little na@@ sty .
that relationship is not main@@ ly dri@@ ven by more crime .
daniel kraft : medicine &apos;s future ? there &apos;s an app for that
i would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
so bell emplo@@ yed an engine@@ er to study those no@@ ises , to try and find out where they came from , with a view towards building the perfect hard@@ ware co@@ de@@ c , which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the pur@@ poses of tele@@ ph@@ ony .
and we were going to do something that was horri@@ ble for the prof@@ ession .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harv@@ est@@ ed from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
when the sea level ro@@ se and tasman@@ ia became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slo@@ wer progress than people on the main@@ land , they actually experienced re@@ gress .
so , what i &apos;d like to talk about is something that was very de@@ ar to ka@@ hn &apos;s heart , which is : how do we disco@@ ver what is really particular about a project ?
if you look at the air pollu@@ tion health effects , this is the number of deaths per year in 2020 just from vehicle ex@@ hau@@ st .
nt : i had bigger ideas .
they work in the same way .
it &apos;s incredible .
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an in@@ vention , not as a human technology , but as a co-@@ evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species , mostly edi@@ ble gras@@ ses , had explo@@ ited us , figured out how to get us to basically de@@ forest the world .
we have got to un@@ te@@ ther clin@@ ici@@ ans and patients from the notion of travel@@ ing to a special bri@@ ck@@ s-@@ and-@@ mor@@ t@@ ar place for all of our care , because these places are often the wrong tool , and the most expensive tool , for the job .
i believe that we are at the start of a collabor@@ ative revolution that will be as significant as the industrial revolution .
my doctors at the may@@ o clin@@ ic ur@@ ged me not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here .
but the same neur@@ on , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being tou@@ ched .
pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ ats .
and i did like , you know , the nar@@ r@@ ator , and i read it .
ok . we &apos;ve heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
and there it is , again , as it &apos;s starting to get resol@@ ved te@@ ct@@ on@@ ically , and then there &apos;s the school .
such an inti@@ mate video .
you &apos;re not really given any instru@@ ctions , but the forces of the process itself keep you in place .
this i know inti@@ ma@@ tely , because even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them , i struggle .
currently , they &apos;re using a method of trial and error , but this could tell you precisely what disease you have .
the sal@@ mon on top is a gene@@ tically engine@@ ered chin@@ o@@ ok sal@@ mon , using a gene from these sal@@ mon and from one other fish that we eat , to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed .
it could really change things quite significantly .
maybe if we all start doing this , we can make it soci@@ ally un@@ accep@@ table to say yes to plastic in the che@@ ck@@ out line .
my students and i got very excited about this a few years ago .
and , of course , happy faces .
so i decided -- i had this crazy ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any at two in the morning .
and this is my favorite .
in fact , it &apos;s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of pa@@ ved roads .
in fact , the american publi@@ sher@@ s of my book , &quot; the elephant , the tiger and the cell phone , &quot; ad@@ ded a gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous subti@@ tle saying , &quot; india : the next 21@@ st-@@ century power . &quot;
not a lot .
it just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
when this am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id sequence gets pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced as atoms , these little letters are sti@@ cky for each other .
so we &apos;re going to start that video .
a little bit like on this picture here .
the women are very good about getting mammo@@ gra@@ ms now .
and i thought , &quot; these ants , are they looking for the que@@ en ant ?
&quot; an australi@@ an study in 2001 found that o@@ live oil in com@@ bin@@ ation with fru@@ its , veget@@ ables and pul@@ ses off@@ ers meas@@ ur@@ able protection against skin wr@@ in@@ kl@@ ings . &quot;
in au@@ stri@@ a , again , nobody che@@ cks the box .

they are powered by the sun . solar pan@@ els power them .
and i wanted to do it , because -- i believed -- to continue my studies .
their importance bl@@ ends into the sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alized dra@@ ma of prime time tv .
could be a really big deal to you . hus@@ band # 1 : is that your wife ?
the world needs an international forum .
we went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound .
now , below that board of dire@@ ctors , you &apos;ve got essentially what are regi@@ onal v@@ ps -- people who control , say , the south side of chicago , or the west side of chicago .
take marriage for example .
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
30 percent of our hou@@ se@@ holds gave .
m thank you all . thanks p@@ at .
this to me , in its own strange way , is very , very com@@ for@@ ting .
here &apos;s a building at ober@@ lin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to oper@@ ate and pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es its own water .
there are those who , if they &apos;re not with us , are against us .
i paint as well .
but i decided and i com@@ mitted to at this point to the thing i most wanted to do -- was to help as many people as possible re@@ gain the creative confidence they lost along their way .
please raise your hand -- oh , that &apos;s a lot .
and country 2 is possibly india . &quot;
it says you &apos;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
it &apos;s something that a group of countries and the world blind union are adv@@ oc@@ ating , a cros@@ s-@@ bor@@ der treat@@ y so that if books are available under a copy@@ right exception and the other country has a copy@@ right exception , we can transport those books across bor@@ ders and give life to people , particularly in developing countries , blind people who don &apos;t have the books to read .
they have to be precisely la@@ th@@ ed .
it &apos;s like when you &apos;re mean to your wife because you &apos;re mad at somebody else .
because that &apos;s really the moment we really know what we &apos;re made of .
everything we know is made of some com@@ bin@@ ation of what you see de@@ pic@@ ted here .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
this is a de@@ generation of the retin@@ a .
so this is a form of synthetic hybri@@ di@@ zation of the genome of an extin@@ ct species with the genome of its closest living rela@@ tive .
and apart from a few very important loo@@ se ends , which you &apos;ve heard about here -- like dark energy and dark matter -- this equ@@ ation descri@@ bes , seems to describe everything about the universe and what &apos;s in it .
if we wait 10 years , it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive , perhaps impossible .
&quot; i want to hold my bre@@ ath for a really long time . how could it be done ? &quot;
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
and with his only diplom@@ a , his primary education cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , he found himself working at a dy@@ er - dr@@ y cle@@ an@@ er .
and you see that the pri@@ est never we@@ ars sho@@ es because hol@@ y feet -- there must be nothing between the feet and the earth for a mam@@ o .
well how would you go about it ?
here we are . unfortunately , i can &apos;t show you a picture of this symmetri@@ cal object .
it &apos;s not really a conscious decision , &quot; i &apos;m going to do this next , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
and the only thing they had con@@ sen@@ sus on : well , if i could see them , i would clearly be able to tell them apart .
see , i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation .
and there it is , that &apos;s the b@@ am@@ bi 16 .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . &quot;
how big ? well , i can give you the numbers -- 14@@ 0,000 square meters -- but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much .
it &apos;s like a rain@@ bo@@ w .
so you see it that way .
it fol@@ ds in thir@@ ds . it &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that origami .
we all need help , even those of us who are very se@@ as@@ oned .
finally , after about 10 years of ali@@ en@@ ating friends and stran@@ gers ali@@ ke , i finally got it , a new personal truth all my own , that if i was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was ga@@ ining , i &apos;d better find a different way of going about it .
without memory we would be am@@ n@@ es@@ i@@ ac@@ s .
there were so many times when i thought i &apos;d hit that limit , but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy .
but that doesn &apos;t mean my bias is wrong , and most important , all of this can be tested scienti@@ fically .
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later , and most women , than@@ k@@ fully , survive .
tra@@ c@@ ey g@@ am@@ ley ste@@ pped up to give me the impossible ki@@ dney that i was never supposed to have .
and they &apos;re going to be wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly tele@@ me@@ ter@@ ed again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monit@@ ored re@@ mot@@ ely .
don &apos;t try to be like those fol@@ ks on &quot; law &amp; amp ; order &quot; and those other tv shows that pu@@ m@@ mel their subje@@ cts into sub@@ mission .
and then wow , what a radi@@ cal idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this new@@ fan@@ gl@@ ed technology to actually interact with a nur@@ se or a doctor on the other end of the line .
another thing that helped me as a little kid is , boy , in the &apos; 50s , you were taught man@@ ners .
now , at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning when you &apos;re all alone , haven &apos;t had much sleep , that was a very roman@@ tic idea , but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there &apos;s somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appe@@ aled to me so much that 20 years later i took a job at the se@@ ti institute . now , i have to say that my memory is not@@ ori@@ ously por@@ ous , and i &apos;ve often wonder@@ ed whether there was any truth in this story , or i was just , you know , mis@@ remember@@ ing something , but i recently just ble@@ w up this old negative of mine , and sure enough , there you can see the sh@@ klo@@ v@@ sky and sa@@ gan book underneath that an@@ alog cal@@ cul@@ ating device .
&quot; well , because the street is sa@@ fer now , &quot; they ans@@ wer@@ ed .
and of course there is rule number nine .
ter@@ ence loved po@@ e@@ try , and the gre@@ ek po@@ et const@@ ant@@ ine ca@@ v@@ af@@ y is one of my favorite po@@ ets .
this is an area that &apos;s lar@@ gely un@@ explor@@ ed but here &apos;s a little bit of data i can show you .
and we have to think much more in terms of narra@@ tives and whose narra@@ tive is going to be effective .
so , this is a view of what humans are .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
la@@ sting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks , fun@@ er@@ al cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies are a rau@@ c@@ ous aff@@ air , where com@@ memor@@ ating someone who &apos;s died is not so much a private sa@@ dness but more of a publi@@ c@@ ly shared transition .
and here is an example of one of her analy@@ ses : &quot; the move from a stru@@ c@@ tur@@ alist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively hom@@ olog@@ ous ways to a view of he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y in which power relations are subject to repe@@ ti@@ tion , conver@@ gen@@ ce and re@@ artic@@ u@@ lation brought the question of tempor@@ ality into the thinking of structure , and mar@@ ked a shift from the form of al@@ th@@ us@@ ser@@ ian theory that takes structural tot@@ alities as theore@@ tical objects ... &quot;
now i am a beli@@ ever in democracy .
you &apos;re going to see , in just two weeks , the normal wor@@ ms are old .
it &apos;s like the water of the stream ; it never si@@ ts still .
that &apos;s the short term . that &apos;s the fl@@ ame part .
if you want a more positive model -- this is the g@@ m car .
four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders love their dinosau@@ rs , they memor@@ ize them .
this problem of shi@@ f@@ ting compar@@ is@@ ons can be@@ de@@ vil our attemp@@ ts to make rational decisions .
i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this co@@ ok@@ book .
are we in the middle of something unusual histor@@ ically in your op@@ ini@@ on ?
so we can run this through to something like pro@@ sthe@@ tics , which is highly speci@@ alized to an individual &apos;s han@@ di@@ ca@@ p .
they &apos;re always made from local ch@@ ert .
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibi@@ tion ever .
and when the natural bre@@ e@@ ze isn &apos;t enough , the kids de@@ plo@@ y bub@@ bles , but not the kind of bub@@ bles you know .
these images that show at one time , there was very fast flo@@ wing water on the surface of mars .
and , sa@@ dly , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have time for you to meet everybody i brought , but -- i &apos;m trying to be@@ have myself , it &apos;s my first time here .
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lo@@ ver .
i don &apos;t want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot .
and before long , the con@@ dom was know as the girl &apos;s best friend .
and it does that in the middle of having great fore@@ play and meeting their needs . so it &apos;s not mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive .
they are living in happiness . they are living in their v@@ ill@@ as .
so to address this , we developed with a dr. brown in stanford : virtual dis@@ se@@ ction table .
you know , just at the beginning of this year , at the turn of the new year , new york city ma@@ yo@@ r michael blo@@ om@@ berg made a new year &apos;s resol@@ ution that he was going to learn to code in 2012 .
so i went up there , and i lived with these guys out in their wh@@ aling camp here , and photographed the entire experience , beginning with the tax@@ i ri@@ de to ne@@ war@@ k air@@ port in new york , and en@@ ding with the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ing of the second whale , seven and a half days later .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
now , as a politi@@ cian myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stran@@ ger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reve@@ al the nature of my prof@@ ession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a sna@@ ke , a monkey and an i@@ gu@@ ana , and through all of this , i feel , stron@@ gly , that something is going wrong .
something happened when i began travel@@ ing in v-day , eight years ago . i got lost .
enormous . ps : you &apos;ve got a ... 14@@ -@@ foot cro@@ c .
for three years , they were in hi@@ ding .
how do we transport an airplane to mars ?
study of the ancient climate is very important .
in my part of the world , too many people live below the poverty line .
another way of putting it is , is there some hum@@ ong@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can spli@@ t into tiny 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a cap@@ tcha they solve a little bit of this problem ?
and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutri@@ ents in the li@@ qu@@ id .
this top@@ ic is also old .
les@@ lie or@@ gel is still a molecular biolog@@ ist , brilliant guy , and or@@ gel &apos;s second rule is : evolution is cle@@ ver@@ er than you are .
we &apos;re all ma@@ mm@@ als here , we all have a lot of neu@@ ral and hor@@ mon@@ al programm@@ ing that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
each stor@@ m sc@@ ours the atmosphere , was@@ hing out du@@ st , so@@ ot , tra@@ ce chemicals , and de@@ pos@@ iting them on the snow p@@ ack year after year , millen@@ nia after millen@@ nia , creating a kind of peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table of elements that at this point is more than 1@@ 1,000 feet th@@ ick .
so this , for example , is hydro@@ gen@@ -@@ gener@@ ating al@@ ga@@ e .
this here , on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , is what &apos;s called a -- if you look at the fine print under the aw@@ ning -- it &apos;s a hotel .
and what happens ?
but we &apos;ve got survi@@ vor@@ s and things that get through , and it turns out the things that get through pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally are cold b@@ loo@@ ds .
in 2011 three young women swe@@ pt the top pri@@ zes of the first google science fair . lau@@ ren ho@@ dge , sh@@ re@@ e bo@@ se and na@@ om@@ i sha@@ h describe their extraordinary projects -- and their route to a passion for science . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , that &apos;s really the goal of my talk , is to a , communicate that moment to you and b , have you leave this s@@ ession a little du@@ mber than when you enter@@ ed .
i &apos;m an individual . i &apos;m one person .
one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today , but in his day it wasn &apos;t taken for granted .
now , with all of my optimis@@ m , and i am an opti@@ m@@ ist , comes a healthy dose of cau@@ tion , or rather , an ur@@ gent need to address some pres@@ sing , complex questions .
it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ates de@@ fic@@ it spending .
when he a@@ im@@ ed , he never mis@@ sed .
now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
and that was done also without permission , although no one seem@@ ed to care .
are you guys ready to celebrate em@@ ma ?
and the experiment@@ er said , &quot; if you &apos;ve finished everything , go home .
yes .
you have to have those ste@@ ps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
and within a hundred years , that population of 24 had explo@@ ded to half a billion .
but what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this , where there &apos;s just so much stuff coming in , it &apos;s just , &quot; start sho@@ ot@@ ing , come on , everybody , we &apos;ve got to just work together , just start sho@@ ot@@ ing . &quot;
and that &apos;s when the liber@@ i@@ ans came along .
so , we have now made an amazing discovery , a po@@ st-@@ do@@ c in the lab who is a physi@@ c@@ ist asked me , what do the cells do when you put them in ?
it was able to do that itself .
also , those super-@@ symmetri@@ c particles are very strong can@@ di@@ dat@@ es for the dark matter .
i don &apos;t know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
here , used as a pro@@ x@@ y , temperature vari@@ ability .
they get lo@@ cked in .
the more optimi@@ stic you were , the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information .
for example , it is counter@@ intui@@ tive to have an il@@ liter@@ ate study particip@@ ant , like cel@@ ine , sign a leng@@ thy con@@ sent form that they are un@@ able to read , let alone understand .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defen@@ se usually win@@ s cham@@ pi@@ on@@ shi@@ ps , and would work hard on defen@@ se .
it &apos;s nearly hal@@ f@@ way around the glo@@ be .
i said , &quot; did je@@ ffer@@ son ever dis@@ ap@@ point you ? &quot;
now , let &apos;s take a little tour around the gulf a little bit .
it &apos;s mostly un@@ explor@@ ed , and yet there are beautiful si@@ ghts like this that cap@@ tiv@@ ate us and make us become familiar with it .
who makes a great interview in this context ?
and this waste@@ bas@@ k@@ et part , that &apos;s to repres@@ ent what the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time itself is doing during this period .
mihal@@ y c@@ zi@@ ks@@ zent@@ mihal@@ y@@ i as@@ ks , &quot; what makes a life worth living ? &quot; not@@ ing that money cannot make us happy , he looks to those who find pleas@@ ure and la@@ sting satis@@ fac@@ tion in activi@@ ties that bring about a state of &quot; flow . &quot;
these aren &apos;t financial stat@@ s ; this is culture .
i drink coffee .
two : well , maybe it exists , but it &apos;s really something else .
and the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a fra@@ me@@ work .
one story is about this baby , and his name is od@@ in .
no , no , no , no , no . i take atten@@ dance .
so i just swit@@ ched on in the train , lou@@ dly .
ed : all right . now last week , when i did this , you had me measure that spo@@ t to the right .
they are only one-@@ sev@@ ent@@ h of the way up that tree .
jen@@ ni@@ fer : a soldi@@ er walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
this is what political scientists call auth@@ or@@ it@@ arian de@@ liber@@ ation , and it happens when governments are actually re@@ aching out to their cri@@ tics and letting them engage with each other online .
a low entrop@@ y con@@ figuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ r@@ ange@@ ments that look that way .
now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extremely unusual example , and i wouldn &apos;t want to be guil@@ ty of the same kind of cher@@ r@@ y-@@ pi@@ cking and sele@@ ctive refer@@ encing that i &apos;m ac@@ c@@ using other people of .
what tri@@ bes are , is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years .
it &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
they can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , all the while knowing that there &apos;s somebody when they come back .
so what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typ@@ ing a cap@@ tcha on the internet .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be refer@@ red to as &quot; la toi@@ le d &apos;@@ ar@@ a@@ ig@@ nee mon@@ di@@ ale &quot; -- the global spider web -- re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions that the french ga@@ ily ignore .
no wonder the moon in the window seems to have dri@@ fted out of a love po@@ em that you used to know by heart .
you can see it doesn &apos;t make sense to make an average of this zero impro@@ v@@ ement and this very fast impro@@ v@@ ement .
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
a land where every field hi@@ des a gra@@ ve , where millions of people have been de@@ por@@ ted or killed in the 20th century .
takes about a minute .
our big break came in 2004 .
now there is also another very important dynamic , and this is a dynamic normally analy@@ tics don &apos;t see .
the villa@@ gers thought she was cur@@ sed ; they didn &apos;t know what to do with her .
mar@@ gar@@ et th@@ at@@ cher was my mother .
the second reason is , we cannot keep doing animal experiment@@ ation forever , and we have to em@@ body all our data and all our knowledge into a working model .
and i was on a college cho@@ ir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were rel@@ ax@@ ing next to this beautiful i@@ dy@@ lli@@ c lake in the mountains .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
that was not my inten@@ tion . i was just making these requ@@ ests as part of research for my first book .
birds then came , bringing in seeds , and our pi@@ le became an o@@ as@@ is of life .
this is the universe of 2007 , the last two months .
it &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
it doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste good , so i &apos;m going to need some help with that .
and , i get a lot of fla@@ k for this at cambridge .
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
it leads , in the worst cases , in the analysis of a soci@@ ologist like emi@@ l dur@@ k@@ heim , it leads to increas@@ ed rates of suici@@ de .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
so we did just this ; we gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
this one &apos;s a little bit more sophi@@ st@@ icated , and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices , use those devices .
and that was the end of the shr@@ in@@ king of vac@@ u@@ um tu@@ bes , but it was not the end of the exponenti@@ al growth of computing .
maybe it even got published in a high-@@ profi@@ le scientific journ@@ al .
i remember him sitting behind the work@@ ben@@ ch s@@ mil@@ ing .
and what we &apos;ve shown is that doing a sha@@ m ir@@ radiation -- this is the th@@ ick line here -- this is sh@@ ining u@@ v on the arm so it war@@ ms up but keeping it covered so the rays don &apos;t hit the skin .
and when i was seven years old , all of a sudden , a search party arri@@ ved at my home .
next is an australi@@ an artist , jan@@ e@@ en jack@@ son , and this is from a project of her@@ s called &quot; what an art@@ work does when we &apos;re not watching . &quot;
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s war@@ ran@@ ted .
so what can we do to restore our micro@@ bi@@ al community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us ?
that &apos;s where all the resources come from .
five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups .
world population , pc plac@@ ements , the archi@@ ve of all the medical liter@@ ature , moore &apos;s law , the old way of sequen@@ cing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff .
so i go , &quot; you know , why don &apos;t we go on the internet , and maybe we can see ... like on wikipedia . &quot;
they go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have st@@ able power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
you know , when you want to forget , you don &apos;t want to see things , so you just want to go to your room , to lo@@ ck yourself inside and say , &quot; that &apos;s enough . &quot;
and that was the fin@@ ishing post right there .
all the dri@@ vers are becoming members . it &apos;s excell@@ ent .
so that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a na@@ sty ki@@ ck@@ back .
this demo@@ graphi@@ c divi@@ den@@ d is incredible , but parado@@ x@@ ically , there &apos;s also the mi@@ rage of mi@@ gh@@ ty labor po@@ ols .
and what was left of the city soon followed .
now why do we call david an under@@ dog ?
it &apos;s not very appropri@@ ate to do it now . some people tell me to do it ; i think , well , that &apos;s not really pro@@ per , you know , these days .
this year , they are now producing eight million nets a year , and they emplo@@ y 5,000 people , 90 percent of wh@@ om are women , mostly uns@@ killed .
and one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty aw@@ ful messa@@ ges , and he was dres@@ sed as bat@@ man .
now , if the e@@ am@@ es@@ es had stopped with that first great solution , then we wouldn &apos;t be the bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ari@@ es of so many wonderful designs today .
go ahead and hit that right sound ic@@ on .
but one , to me , that &apos;s most comp@@ elling is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar sensi@@ tivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output .
a human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent kill another pol@@ ar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one step . what the pol@@ ar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes .
over the last 10 years , i &apos;ve had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries , many of them in the emerging markets , in latin america , asia , and my own continent of africa .
a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation .
my parents had this whole el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate story about sant@@ a cl@@ aus : how they had talked to sant@@ a cl@@ aus himself and agreed that instead of sant@@ a deli@@ vering our pres@@ ents over the night of christmas e@@ ve , like he did for every other family who got to open their surpris@@ es first thing christmas morning , our family would give sant@@ a more time .
now , let &apos;s imagine those plates ag@@ it@@ ated with community actions around food .
they have sensor@@ s on their wing .
about four years ago i took a team of students down to ha@@ iti , and we worked with peace cor@@ ps volunte@@ ers there .
it was not christmas time . there was a christmas tree .
then there &apos;s an important military role .
i have half a do@@ zen ideas .
there is no way you can know what people want .
wonderful study compar@@ ing different countries .
now , what i &apos;m going to do is , i &apos;m going to see how -- i can &apos;t see out of these , ok .
this is what the computer inter@@ face used to look like , dos .
this re@@ moves the dist@@ in@@ ction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also deter@@ mine the ini@@ tial state .
now , that &apos;s for oral re@@ hydra@@ tion therapy .
thank you . i &apos;m so happy to be here .
we built 50 units to do that as a monit@@ or@@ ing test for the dur@@ ability and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure and ter@@ mit@@ es , so on .
we st@@ um@@ bled on your video on deci@@ mals and it got through .
and i remembered a line from the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata , the great indian ep@@ ic : &quot; what is the most won@@ dr@@ ous thing in the world , y@@ u@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ thir@@ a ? &quot;
americans have so often tried to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate their ideas of choice , believ@@ ing that they will be , or ought to be , wel@@ com@@ ed with open he@@ arts and minds .
i said , &quot; no , i can &apos;t use my legs . &quot;
this is the wor@@ d@@ scape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
this is a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical ad .
we demand an explanation from god .
as we make them smaller and less expensive , the electr@@ ons have less distance to travel .
when i &apos;m starting talks like this , i usually do a whole spiel about sustain@@ ability because a lot of people out there don &apos;t know what that is .
it is that specific .
and then once i have that fol@@ ded shape that we call the b@@ ase , you can make the legs nar@@ ro@@ wer , you can b@@ end them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
ad@@ her@@ ence rates . how many people are taking their insu@@ lin every day ?
his admini@@ stration nar@@ ro@@ wed key m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ al th@@ or@@ ough@@ far@@ es from five lan@@ es to three , out@@ la@@ wed par@@ king on those streets , exp@@ and@@ ed pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an wal@@ k@@ ways and bi@@ ke lan@@ es , created public pla@@ z@@ as , created one of the most efficient bus mas@@ s-@@ trans@@ it systems in the entire world .
the idea is we create this long he@@ dge of green@@ houses facing the wind .
but we believed that we had a very soli@@ d metho@@ d@@ ology that might work ...
and then as the cells grow , they &apos;re all rele@@ as@@ ing that molecule into the environment , so there &apos;s lots of molecule there .
jo@@ se@@ tte she@@ er@@ an : en@@ ding hunger now
but it was earlier this year , when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization .
so , how could this happen ?
which i &apos;ve covered in coffee , and i ask the re@@ cep@@ tion@@ ist to plu@@ g in this us@@ b key and print me a new one .
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tis@@ m out of the way .
they were literally turning pollu@@ tion into ab@@ undance for a desert people .
often we can get c@@ lar@@ ity or the answer to a simple question very quickly , like this one , the recent ic@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c vol@@ can@@ o .
it &apos;s a little bit of a de@@ di@@ cation to james , james wat@@ son .
it &apos;s a planet somewhat similar to earth . it &apos;s a little bit smaller , but the land mass on mars is about the same as the land mass on earth , you know , if you don &apos;t take the oceans into account .
does he not look content , ready to go , like he could survive anything ? and then , if you look at the kid in back , it looks like he &apos;s already cho@@ king before the cr@@ ash even happens .
it &apos;s about three miles out of nai@@ ro@@ bi , and it &apos;s a mile long and about two-@@ ten@@ ths of a mile wide , where over half a million people live cra@@ mm@@ ed in these little tin sha@@ cks , generation after generation , r@@ ent@@ ing them , often eight or 10 people to a room .
i &apos;ve brought with me , from sou@@ thern california , the f@@ m device .
and these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
but of course none of that happened .
and i &apos;ve put the formul@@ a up there .
ice in my ice ch@@ est mel@@ ted within hours , and it was pretty miser@@ able .
you just had teams of hundreds of people .
this is a little bit of a problem , so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control , and this is really where the idea of re@@ view and pe@@ er re@@ view comes in .
but if you sat down and asked him , &quot; who are you really , and what do you do ? &quot;
right ?
and to a man -- they were all men -- to a man , every single one of them said , &quot; my mother . &quot;
now this transformation has dou@@ bled the area of the original figure , and therefore we have just learned that the area of the tri@@ angle equ@@ als the area of this re@@ ct@@ angle divided by two .
femin@@ ist blog@@ ging is basically the 21@@ st century version of consciousness raising .
w@@ k : yeah .
but , there &apos;s one catch . this is the fat@@ al -- you know , we saw it in starting these programs up .
maybe you can re@@ lie@@ ve the phan@@ tom pain , the phan@@ tom cra@@ mp .
he did not , happ@@ ily , follow in the foot@@ ste@@ ps of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , and tell us to just go shop@@ ping .
my point is , they couldn &apos;t go beyond 15 .
now , i &apos;m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool inter@@ vention is .
and my father said , &quot; ok , listen .
let me start with the aspe@@ ct of comfort , because many people are con@@ f@@ using ambi@@ ent temperature with ther@@ mal comfort .
they said , &quot; can we do an advertising campaign ?
and the training center there was built around the scientific con@@ gol@@ ese st@@ af@@ f and some american scientists also .
we are the only ones who can make love for hours , have a bli@@ ss@@ ful time , multiple or@@ gas@@ ms , and touch nobody , just because we can imagine it .
but surro@@ und the bre@@ wing of that coffee with the ambi@@ ance of a star@@ bucks , with the auth@@ enti@@ c c@@ ed@@ ar that goes inside of there , and now , because of that auth@@ enti@@ c experience , you can charge two , three , four , five dollars for a c@@ up of coffee .
and no matter where i am or what i &apos;m doing , i &apos;ve got to do that .
math is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own intui@@ tion .
i wrote a magazine , was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted for it when i was a teenager .
and mom over@@ heard us and said , &quot; well , you know what ? if you really understand the nature of this celebra@@ tion , it is that this is a time where you ex@@ tend the circle of love .
if you don &apos;t bri@@ be the offic@@ er , then you will get a traffic ti@@ cket -- or , as is the case of &quot; far@@ go , &quot; worse -- whether the honest offic@@ er is honest or dis@@ honest .
every fish that gets away gro@@ ws with every telling of the tale .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
now as our pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons de@@ materi@@ alize into the cloud , a bl@@ ur@@ ry line is appe@@ aring between what &apos;s mine , what &apos;s yours , and what &apos;s ours .
we &apos;ve written a number of things on the role of ga@@ ia hypo@@ thesis -- whether or not you could consider earth as a single enti@@ ty in any meaningful scientific sense , and then , as an out@@ growth of that , i worked on the environmental con@@ sequences of nuclear war .
thank you .
this is where it really hit home for me -- that my legs could be we@@ ar@@ able sculp@@ ture .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
i was also interested in the physi@@ c@@ ality of this format , because you have to walk to see it .
pan@@ el b is the woman , very smo@@ oth .
it &apos;s about supply and avail@@ ability .
and that &apos;s the fun .
and i want to close with two quick stories to illu@@ strate this .
you feel like you &apos;re on top of your game and you can do anything you want .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is bor@@ e into the brain to see where all this happens .
you have to con@@ den@@ se a story into 3@@ 2 pages , usually .
if you start taking los@@ ses , they see you as weak and sh@@ it . &quot;
it &apos;s not the pain@@ ting we would have pain@@ ted , it &apos;s the pain@@ ting that we actually pain@@ ted .
but he too wa@@ its pati@@ ently , gets his food and goes on .
you can tell people what you are going to do , and then you still nu@@ dge them to dis@@ close arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary amo@@ un@@ ts of personal information .
&quot; what do you think of my dou@@ b@@ let ? &quot; i asked .
the fra@@ ction of those that get the second replic@@ ator .
thank you very much .
i was an out@@ si@@ der who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ide@@ ology of the islam@@ ic revolution .
you &apos;ve all done it .
the occu@@ p@@ y movement found a voice , and i still have to speak english constantly .
resi@@ dents were often given less than a month &apos;s notice before their buildings were ra@@ zed .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
i &apos;ve had a patent , and that was cool , and we started a company , and it grew , and it became the biggest , and then it went down , and then it became the biggest again , which is harder than the first time , and then we sold it , and then we sold it again .
second , the geographi@@ es in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of , spo@@ radi@@ c electricity and high levels of corruption .
maggie and milly , molly and may they went down to the beach one day to play and maggie discovered a sh@@ ell that s@@ ang so swe@@ et@@ ly she couldn &apos;t remember her trou@@ bles maggie and milly , molly and may maggie and milly , molly and may milly be@@ fri@@ ended a str@@ and@@ ed star whose rays , whose rays five langu@@ id fing@@ ers were maggie and milly , molly and may maggie and milly , molly and may molly was ch@@ as@@ ed by a horri@@ ble thing which ra@@ ced si@@ de@@ ways blo@@ wing blo@@ wing blo@@ wing may came home with a smo@@ oth , ro@@ und stone small as a world and as large as alone for whatever we lose like a you or a me always ourselves that we find at the sea thank you .
let &apos;s take mer@@ it@@ o@@ cra@@ cy .
now , if islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great con@@ fron@@ tation , what does that mean ?
so i started looking for any evidence that -- does conne@@ ctivity really increase produ@@ ctivity ?
that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m using this po@@ di@@ um and using these not@@ es .
and at heart , both re@@ forma@@ tions , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
even my books on children have c@@ ute , fu@@ zz@@ y animals .
the artist had very cle@@ ver@@ ly suggest@@ ed people and clo@@ th@@ es and wa@@ g@@ ons and all sorts of things , and my brain had taken the sugge@@ sti@@ on .
it &apos;s your 100 percent factor . games are brilliant at this .
now we have pages -- the un@@ it has been resol@@ ved into pages , so one page links to another page .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had break@@ fast with their grandmother .
i remember when you were the first woman as secre@@ tary of state , and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing , how you looked -- the thing that happens to a lot of women , especially if they &apos;re the first in a position .
what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geome@@ try and the interactions of el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary particles .
that one &apos;s gone as well .
this is another species of work that i do .
in bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a , on las ra@@ m@@ bl@@ as for some film fe@@ sti@@ val , i did the hollywood sign going and coming , made a building out of it , and they built it .
so i didn &apos;t know any of this , and we got a present@@ ation that had an agen@@ da , looked like this .
and he cli@@ cks the &quot; buy now &quot; butt@@ on .
and what you see is bright and dark regi@@ ons , and that &apos;s about as far as it got for us .
and finally , depen@@ ding on your particular version of european simil@@ arity , you can think about the u.@@ k and fr@@ ance as either similar cul@@ tur@@ ally or not .
that means , when bar@@ b@@ ari@@ a is back , forget the beautiful cha@@ irs , forget the beautiful hotel , forget design , even -- i &apos;m sorry to say -- forget art .
we compare each u@@ plo@@ ad against all of the reference fil@@ es in our dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and i put strategy at the top of it .
let us re@@ call the pione@@ ers who made this technical mar@@ vel possible .
we ban@@ ned those chemicals , and we replac@@ ed them , un@@ know@@ ingly , with other sub@@ stances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more po@@ tent as he@@ at@@ -@@ tra@@ pping , greenhouse g@@ ases than carbon di@@ oxide .
this is a dna synthesi@@ zer , and here at the bottom are just bot@@ t@@ les of a , t , c and g -- the four chemicals that make up our dna chain .
we only have a million galaxies , right ?
very soon they &apos;ll be doing everything for us .
but the thing is that any one of those would requi@@ re some effort and motivation .
one of the things that wor@@ ries me is how easily what you might call mer@@ it@@ o@@ cra@@ tic plu@@ to@@ cra@@ cy can become cr@@ ony plu@@ to@@ cra@@ cy .
if you think about it , every cell in your body has the same dna as you had when you were an em@@ br@@ yo .
it &apos;s not the nation@@ -@@ states that have potential access to mass destruction , but individuals .
they have no idea who &apos;s been pos@@ ing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of ta@@ pes , and they say , &quot; oh , we want to hi@@ re these people , &quot; -- all the high-@@ power pos@@ ers -- &quot; we don &apos;t want to hi@@ re these people .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , i began to think of things in a different way .
and it turns out the royal in@@ signi@@ a has a re@@ ct@@ angle within a re@@ ct@@ angle within a re@@ ct@@ angle , and the path through that pal@@ ace is actually this spi@@ ral here .
now , how would you walk -- because you know , my prof@@ ession , the music prof@@ ession doesn &apos;t see it that way .
the other thing we did is that we smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed the profi@@ le .
this forming of the powerful atta@@ ch@@ ment between child and par@@ ent provi@@ des the building blo@@ cks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or development .
boy : oh , mar@@ cus , you know what i mean .
touch is even better .
at the global com@@ mission we have studied the evidence , and we &apos;ve heard the experi@@ ences of over 7@@ 00 people from 1@@ 40 countries .
if i walk into a store in the united states , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in fi@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pped at great expen@@ se to the united states .
everybody could go and listen , you know -- ordinary people , even the sul@@ tan , muslims and non-@@ muslims .
it &apos;s hard to imagine or measure .
he la@@ id down the mathematical founda@@ tions for computer science , and said , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter how you make a computer . &quot;
i &apos;m a very serious &quot; possi@@ bili@@ st . &quot;
and what was even more stri@@ king to me , and what i really got hung up on , was that the world inside the screen seem@@ ed to have no physical reality of its own .
this issue isn &apos;t just theore@@ tical .
he didn &apos;t say we didn &apos;t even have a theory . he says , we don &apos;t even know how to begin to think about it -- we don &apos;t even have a fra@@ me@@ work .
so if human need is the place to start , and prototyp@@ ing , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the dest@@ ination .
b@@ ones were broken . especially in old , fra@@ gi@@ le people , you couldn &apos;t use it .
of course not , you can be sele@@ ctive . it &apos;s expected .
if the government &apos;s fis@@ cal survival depen@@ ds on it having to raise money from its own people , such a government is dri@@ ven by self-@@ interest to go@@ ver@@ n in a more en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ed fashi@@ on .
india &apos;s revolution@@ ary ar@@ a@@ v@@ ind eye care system has given sight to millions . th@@ ul@@ asi@@ ra@@ j ra@@ v@@ ill@@ a looks at the in@@ gen@@ ious approach that drives its treatment costs down and quality up , and why its metho@@ ds should tri@@ g@@ ger a re-@@ think of all human services .
then these two fel@@ lo@@ ws came along , and they were flying kit@@ es to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .
i also use it as a tool for visu@@ ali@@ zing and tracking pollu@@ tion .
these are some of the businesses : mu@@ sh@@ rooms , cr@@ ab@@ s , veget@@ ables , trees , fru@@ its , and this is very interesting -- nike ice cre@@ am and nike bis@@ cu@@ its ; this is a village spon@@ sor@@ ed by nike .
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don &apos;t always do their la@@ undry as much as they should .
instead of anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating , the child always follo@@ ws where the ball has been .
i always say to my partner , mar@@ is@@ a gar@@ din@@ i , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .
this is another po@@ ster from the school of visual arts .
and generally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news .
and i hope i &apos;ve convin@@ ced you of that , which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders , and your national leaders , &quot; why haven &apos;t you sol@@ ved these problems ?
here &apos;s a little s@@ nap@@ shot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a domin@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years .
because if you sit a long time in summer in shor@@ ts , you will walk away with temporary br@@ and@@ ing of the story el@@ ement on your th@@ ig@@ h@@ s .
one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family , and this really tra@@ gic thing happened where my si@@ ster@@ -@@ in-@@ law , her inte@@ st@@ ine suddenly stran@@ gl@@ ed one day , and we took her to the emer@@ gen@@ cy room , and she was , she was in really bad shape .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
you go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term .
so , we put my hand in my po@@ cket and say , &quot; guys , let &apos;s just buy stuff .
so we have this dat@@ ab@@ ase of things .
and by 2010 , we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman .
they &apos;re still probably us@@ able . they could be &quot; re-@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed , &quot; but the way they count things , which is very complicated , we think we have about a third of the nuclear wea@@ po@@ ns we had before .
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our comple@@ xity and fra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty and the danger@@ s that face us , but it can also show us our power with collective learning .
there is no care@@ taking in desire .
i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attra@@ cted to the type of man that i really , really wanted to mar@@ ry .
we don &apos;t need more data -- we need a good theory about it .
when i got to the — for the next four , five years , i was held in four different children &apos;s homes .
let me show you what it looks like .
and notice that as the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um gro@@ ws , it con@@ qu@@ ers terri@@ tory and then it begins the net .
now the ra@@ w material of it , of course , is just the music of everyday life .
took off fast , didn &apos;t get far . i fi@@ red , &apos; po@@ w ! &apos; fo@@ ol fell between two par@@ ked cars .
but the challenge is really for ri@@ ley &apos;s future teachers , the ones she has yet to meet .
the threat to worry about isn &apos;t stran@@ gers .
so our dream is to bring teen@@ a@@ gers together , so they &apos;ll have a community service experience as well as a cros@@ s-@@ cultural experience , as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure .
this is a guy called ju@@ ander@@ son .
but even as a child , i could feel the hea@@ vin@@ ess in their he@@ arts .
and in addition , we &apos;ve actually used pol@@ ari@@ zers on all the lights -- just like pol@@ ari@@ zed sun@@ glas@@ ses can block the gl@@ are off of the road , pol@@ ari@@ zers can block the shine off of the skin , so we don &apos;t get all those spe@@ cul@@ ar refle@@ ctions to take this map .
thank you .
it &apos;s in fact , that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead .
it &apos;s not that easy !
the dance of our gl@@ an@@ ces , challenge , ab@@ di@@ cation , eff@@ ac@@ ement , the per@@ fu@@ me of our con@@ ster@@ nation .
and this is the model , how it &apos;s going to work . so , it &apos;s the same system ; the vehicle is different . and that &apos;s the model .
and so does every wild hab@@ it@@ at on the planet , like the amazon rain@@ forest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
and last but not least , it is an ob@@ s@@ ession .
&quot; we &apos;re going to give you five bucks -- four dollars for your time . &quot;
but wait , the good news is it &apos;s at least better than me@@ th labs and gon@@ or@@ rhe@@ a .
we are all totally recy@@ cl@@ able .
and i said , &quot; where &apos;d you get that from ? &quot;
di@@ é@@ b@@ é@@ do fran@@ c@@ is k@@ é@@ r@@ é knew exactly what he wanted to do when he got his degre@@ e in architecture … he wanted to go home to gand@@ o in bur@@ kin@@ a fas@@ o , to help his neighbors re@@ ap the benef@@ it of his education . in this char@@ ming talk , k@@ é@@ r@@ é shows off some of the beautiful structures he &apos;s helped to build in his small village in the years since then , including an awar@@ d-@@ w@@ inn@@ ing primary school made from cla@@ y by the entire community .
ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of re@@ gr@@ essi@@ ve and on@@ er@@ ous im@@ migra@@ tion laws , in reality tv that th@@ ri@@ ves on hu@@ mili@@ ation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , day-@@ in , day-@@ out in the united states , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , please report any su@@ spi@@ cious behavior or su@@ spi@@ cious individuals to the auth@@ orities near@@ est you , &quot; when all of these ways we are encoura@@ ged to view our fellow human being with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty and fear and con@@ temp@@ t and su@@ spi@@ ci@@ on .
it &apos;s in operation between earth and mars .
and they would just kind of throw the bu@@ ckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away .
and that is , there is an ab@@ normal gene , a mu@@ tation in the gene that caus@@ es this ab@@ normal cross wir@@ ing .
he said , &quot; did you qu@@ it or were you fi@@ red ? &quot;
so now , what i can do -- i can au@@ g@@ ment the world around me with this digital information .
for example , a friend of mine .
and if they try to fight us in the traditional , stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t-@@ up man@@ ner we &apos;re going to k@@ ick their ass , which is why people don &apos;t try to do that any more .
that &apos;s ken on the right getting beat three to one by wat@@ son , the &quot; je@@ opar@@ dy ! &quot; -@@ playing super@@ computer from i@@ b@@ m .
we &apos;ve put all of that together into one thing , and i &apos;ll show you what that syn@@ thesis looks like .
we &apos;re seeing the con@@ sequences all around us .
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed that ex@@ act diffic@@ ul@@ ty on a da@@ ily basis , i had never seen the in@@ her@@ ent challenge of communication in so cr@@ y@@ st@@ all@@ ine a light .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
na@@ if al-@@ muta@@ wa : super@@ heroes inspired by islam
i &apos;ve spe@@ cul@@ ated that bat@@ s may see color with their e@@ ars .
so , i &apos;m going to have a moment to think , and i &apos;ll try to make something out of it .
so i wish you the best of all possible jour@@ ne@@ ys and the courage to speak soft@@ ly .
and basically on hospital day eight , that &apos;s when they called us .
in math , we know the obje@@ ctive facts .
and there is no way of your being not limit@@ less too .
c@@ l : now i &apos;m not suggest@@ ing that the c@@ at is hearing that tr@@ um@@ pet the way we &apos;re hearing it .
but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology doesn &apos;t just get adop@@ ted because it works .
and , very simply , and i &apos;m really cu@@ tting it short because of the time limits here , it &apos;s essentially the ability of a country to attra@@ ct others because of its culture , its political values , its foreign policies .
well , he was the former oil minister of ni@@ ger@@ ia under president ab@@ ach@@ a , and it just so happens he &apos;s a convi@@ cted money la@@ under@@ er too .
and that success@@ es are being ch@@ al@@ ked up on this very important fight .
so he said , &quot; all right . i get the point . &quot; he went back .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , &quot; what hand gras@@ p pattern do i want ? &quot;
computer : memory , th@@ um@@ p . c@@ l : th@@ um@@ p of the beat in a known repe@@ at rhyth@@ m and rhy@@ me , they make me complete the climb is su@@ bli@@ me when i &apos;m on the mic spit@@ tin &apos; rhy@@ mes that hit you like a li@@ ght@@ ning stri@@ ke i search for the truth in this e@@ tern@@ al qu@@ est my passion &apos;s not fashi@@ on , you can see how i &apos;m dres@@ sed psychop@@ ath@@ ic words in my head appear wh@@ is@@ per these lyri@@ cs only i can hear the art of disco@@ vering and that which is ho@@ vering inside the mind of those un@@ con@@ fin@@ ed all of these words keep po@@ uring out like rain i need a mad scientist to check my brain i guaran@@ tee you that will never happen again .
it will make you im@@ mor@@ tal .
in our mind , the relevant metri@@ c is student@@ -@@ to-@@ valu@@ ab@@ le-@@ human@@ -@@ ti@@ me@@ - with@@ -@@ the-@@ teacher ra@@ ti@@ o .
right here i &apos;m ad@@ ding a s@@ ine wave with four pe@@ a@@ ks and turning it on .
these became the two boo@@ ken@@ ds of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mir@@ r@@ ored the changing development landscape .
i still start every day practic@@ ing playing b@@ ach .
and the basic message is that the western power@@ s do not care about civili@@ an deaths , so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with western power@@ s are fair game .
this tells us that that in@@ signific@@ ance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can principle , it &apos;s all wrong .
a child can na@@ vig@@ ate with an x@@ box controll@@ er or a game controll@@ er .
the surprise of bil@@ ba@@ o was in its context to the city .
so here r is the charac@@ teri@@ stic leng@@ th of the robot .
that was my mantra .
now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are , wouldn &apos;t it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this ?
and in neuro@@ science , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain .
so , i went yesterday , i apo@@ logi@@ ze , i ski@@ pped a few of the talks , and i went over to the national acade@@ my of sci@@ ences building , and they sell to@@ ys , giant microbes .
thank you very much .
in fact , that was a piece by bee@@ tho@@ ven , and so i was not func@@ tioning as a com@@ pos@@ er .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazi@@ l .
and as i said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
and people have different vie@@ ws on this .
there &apos;s a whole class of problems like this , ones with adap@@ tive adver@@ s@@ ari@@ es . they r@@ ar@@ ely if ever present with a repe@@ at@@ able pattern that &apos;s disc@@ ern@@ able to computers .
name it , i &apos;m on it .
there &apos;s a lot of exciting things , and i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about them .
and then the second time i tried it , the coun@@ sel@@ or came up to me with a concern@@ ed expression on her face and she repe@@ ated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be out@@ going .
and they are just as suspe@@ ct in telling us to optimi@@ ze these little things around the ed@@ ges and missing the elephant in the living room .
maybe , to really be happy , we need to stay completely immer@@ sed and focused on our experience in the moment .
it &apos;s a beautiful idea . the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who mer@@ it to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by imp@@ lication , and in a far more na@@ sty way , believe in a society where those who des@@ erve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
well , because an eli@@ te and its facili@@ tat@@ ors have been making millions of dollars for many years .
it cost me 2@@ 50,000 dollars to build this .
what if my mother had told us that fi@@ de &apos;s family was poor and hard@@ working ?
now it &apos;s a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , in the chimpanze@@ es .
but every single thing that makes us , every atom in us , has already created a my@@ ri@@ ad of different things and will go on to create a my@@ ri@@ ad of new things .
now , by corruption i don &apos;t mean brown paper ba@@ g cas@@ h secre@@ ted among members of con@@ gress .
we &apos;re in the process of trans@@ forming from this , to what i would call a bi@@ op@@ hi@@ lic society , one where we learn to nur@@ ture society .
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
and the only accep@@ table answer is -- -- yes .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
which , even at yale , is extra@@ ordin@@ arily rare .
did the camera got it ?
you &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s waste@@ ful .
that &apos;s the size of africa .
d : michael , what &apos;s your take on the people story ? are you interested ?
imagine if a group of sculp@@ tors could be inside of a lat@@ ti@@ ce of atoms and sc@@ ul@@ pt with their material .
and it &apos;s time for our mathematics cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um to change from an@@ alog to digital , from the more classi@@ cal , continu@@ ous mathematics , to the more modern , dis@@ crete mathematics -- the mathematics of un@@ certain@@ ty , of rand@@ om@@ ness , of data -- that being prob@@ ability and statistics .
we have to change the minds of the american people . because pres@@ ently the politi@@ cians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
o@@ z takes one hour to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
so what you see here -- i know it sounds funny , but that &apos;s the way it works .
you can of course watch movies .
that &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
so , they &apos;re all flo@@ ating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
the sa@@ d thing is , when it comes to diet , is that even when well-@@ inten@@ tioned fe@@ ds try to do right by us , they fa@@ il .
eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth : tell me , is it true ?
so adoles@@ cence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological , hor@@ mon@@ al , physical changes of pu@@ ber@@ ty and ends at the age at which an individual at@@ tains a st@@ able , independent role in society .
i know what these kids des@@ erve on the healthcare side .
why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
and it &apos;s fair to say that if you look up somebody &apos;s no@@ se , you &apos;re unlikely to see anything res@@ em@@ bl@@ ing this .
he was mostly interested in ink b@@ lea@@ ching .
compassion , because a billion people are living in societies that have not off@@ ered cre@@ di@@ ble hope .
we don &apos;t think you can pull it off , we &apos;re not going to give you our 17@@ ,000 peace ke@@ e@@ pers for fo@@ d@@ der . &quot;

a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
this is the notion of loss a@@ version .
here &apos;s what happened last fall that has really un@@ ner@@ ved the researchers .
a pair of heli@@ ces and 40 wo@@ o@@ den s@@ lat@@ s .
and in this context , you can only talk about the prob@@ ability of finding a certain value of the hig@@ gs mass .
an al@@ mo@@ st-@@ extin@@ ct animal from x@@ o@@ ch@@ im@@ il@@ co , mexico called an ax@@ ol@@ ot@@ l that can re-@@ generate its li@@ m@@ bs .
there you go chris .
and the poor man said , &quot; and you mean god didn &apos;t answer my ple@@ as ? &quot;
the meat is tor@@ n up .
it goes very slowly .
you will decide whether you want to don@@ ate your organs or not .
it sounds like , he says , &quot; god , i want you to make me famous . &quot;
you know , you &apos;ve come home from a long day , and you take a glass of wine , and you put your feet up .
this , too , is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
over tens and hundreds of thousands of years , we evolved to find certain things stimul@@ ating , and as very intelligent , civili@@ zed beings , we &apos;re enorm@@ ously stimul@@ ated by problem solving and learning .
now the video games industry is far and away the fa@@ st@@ est growing of all modern media .
so , life -- long li@@ fes@@ p@@ ans -- like , that is to say , much more than 30 -- weren &apos;t sele@@ cted for , but we are learning to actually manipu@@ late and change these software programs through the biot@@ echn@@ ology revolution .
so here imagine an electro@@ de im@@ plan@@ ted on the back of the sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d to deliver pain@@ less stimu@@ lation .
the sa@@ cre@@ d river , the ur@@ u@@ b@@ am@@ ba , or the vil@@ can@@ ota , which is itself the earth@@ ly equivalent of the mil@@ ky way , but it &apos;s also the traject@@ ory that vi@@ ra@@ co@@ ch@@ a walked at the da@@ wn of time when he brought the universe into being .
we need to be thinking more about per@@ ma@@ culture , which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .
he just knows how to run a company .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s for . it &apos;s so that ideas don &apos;t die out .
rory , thank you very much .
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
and the reason is simple : because wind buil@@ ds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
so the over@@ all consumption of energy is about 25 watts at ta@@ ke@@ off and 16 to 18 watts in flight .
and they don &apos;t usually ask for permission ; they just go ahead and do it , and then other googl@@ ers join in , and it just gets bigger and bigger .
it &apos;s actually surpris@@ ingly simple .
and i suspe@@ ct many of you gave something to the people of ha@@ iti this year .
you &apos;ll be seeing one of the most high-@@ performance materials known to man .
only nine percent is pas@@ sen@@ ger cars , interest@@ ingly enough .
and making us go on wonderful , long bi@@ ke ri@@ des .
and they &apos;d say , &quot; play that part again . &quot;
he poli@@ tely agreed that an appropri@@ ate name for the members of the association did not exist .
and i also repor@@ ted that we &apos;d made this mind-@@ blo@@ wing discovery -- this on@@ c@@ e-@@ in-@@ a-@@ life@@ time discovery of to@@ wer@@ ing je@@ ts er@@ up@@ ting from those fra@@ ctures at the south pole , consi@@ sting of tiny water ice cr@@ y@@ st@@ als ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by water va@@ po@@ r and simple organic com@@ pounds like carbon di@@ oxide and me@@ than@@ e .
he was speaking at a dinner , he said , &quot; wall street got dr@@ unk . &quot;
in this case , the character &apos;s hands are fi@@ x@@ ed to a particular point in space , and all we &apos;ve told the character to do is to struggle .
j@@ b : ok , put this -- ok , i &apos;ll just hold this thing . ok , great .
which brings us to sk@@ ill number two a system has .
so this graph here , i &apos;m going to show you now .
because we &apos;ve got people in all five , around us .
tour@@ ist : i &apos;ve taken my step@@ -@@ daughter here from indi@@ an@@ a@@ poli@@ s .
and they &apos;re different .
and it &apos;s from x-ray cr@@ y@@ st@@ allo@@ graphy , so it &apos;s an accurate model of dna .
imagine if you &apos;re speaking with somebody who &apos;s growing things and making them fl@@ our@@ ish , somebody who &apos;s using their tal@@ ents to do something productive , somebody who &apos;s built their own business from sc@@ rat@@ ch , someone who is surro@@ unded by ab@@ undance , not scar@@ city , who &apos;s in fact creating ab@@ undance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not emp@@ ty hands asking for you to give them something .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your home@@ work , in order to understand whether this is true .
it &apos;s just d@@ ough that is we@@ t .
that fi@@ x@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with a meal -- changes .
well , that &apos;s a good question .
autonom@@ ous cars are coming -- and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . chris ger@@ des reve@@ als how he and his team are developing robotic race cars that can drive at 150 mp@@ h while avo@@ i@@ ding every possible accident . and yet , in studying the bra@@ in@@ waves of professional ra@@ cing dri@@ vers , ger@@ des says he has ga@@ ined a new appreci@@ ation for the instin@@ cts of professional dri@@ vers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s about inter@@ facing these markets direct into the highest offici@@ al chan@@ n@@ els in the land .
women get inti@@ macy from fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face talking .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
thank you .
now what form do they take ?
the publi@@ cation of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
and so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot ple@@ xi@@ glass structure .
but i think that glam@@ our actually has a much bro@@ ader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fic@@ tional characters , but also comes in other forms .
they shu@@ t down . they turn off .
girl : are you si@@ ck ?
so all these fac@@ tors , and many more bes@@ i@@ des , we don &apos;t even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to de@@ fe@@ at a mon@@ stro@@ sity as big as bin la@@ den@@ ism , the global j@@ i@@ had , you needed this group effort .
so in some sense , the foot soldi@@ ers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at mcdonald &apos;s .
the scene of ar@@ rest , the scene of m@@ isi@@ den@@ ti@@ fication , the ali@@ bi location .
but actually , i believe there are really two micro@@ so@@ f@@ ts .
and you count the number of times until the pattern head@@ -@@ tail@@ -@@ head appears and you average them . ok ?
and i said , &quot; well , you know , that might be a bit ambi@@ tious for our budget . &quot;
those last few pictures were of ray hi@@ cks , who just passed away last year .
and in doing so , they &apos;ll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year . a million lives .
so something to think about ton@@ ight if you &apos;ve had a couple .
this is probably true .
that stuff -- it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
and it made me su@@ spi@@ cious .
and , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing angiogen@@ esis .
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was roll@@ ing around , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
it shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
and you &apos;ve got to get better , and better , and better , and better .
the other picture is the popul@@ arity of the real need for change .
but you can actually per@@ ver@@ sely tell people to come , convince them that they have to come .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they &apos;ve been left out in one way or another .
so , there &apos;s a rhyth@@ m to it .
my colleagues , compar@@ ing com@@ position of chemical elements in different gal@@ ac@@ tic stars , actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy .
and you can see this indian p@@ sor@@ i@@ as@@ is break@@ through ob@@ ta@@ ined by this re@@ verse form of &#91; un@@ clear &#93; by doing things differently .
i mean , these are sort of the extreme examples , and they &apos;re am@@ using and good to lau@@ gh at .
what we need is information .
and it has ar@@ ou@@ sed huge anger and fru@@ stration among our young generation .
but what does it mean ?
two weeks after my spe@@ ech , in tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds of portraits were made .
finan@@ cially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
they thought it would reduce their proper@@ ty values .
and i think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappe@@ aring from artificial intelligence and robots .
language really is the voice of our genes .
but sometimes it just sat there .
this says that entrop@@ y , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase .
we do like to consu@@ me , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
chip ki@@ d@@ d : designing books is no lau@@ gh@@ ing matter . ok , it is .
so , it &apos;s needs we have . i believe there are six human needs .
we bring in civil society , we bring in n@@ gos , we bring in researchers and scientists to have an in@@ formed discussion -- sometimes a battle roy@@ ale -- to figure out what are the key im@@ pac@@ ts of these products , what is a global ben@@ ch@@ mark , what &apos;s an accep@@ table impact , and design standards around that .
but it &apos;s not just australi@@ a that has better health than britain .
it has no choice but to be@@ have .
some years later , i and this woman -- we &apos;ll call her &quot; ca@@ therine fle@@ t@@ cher &quot; -- -- went travel@@ ing through the south of portu@@ gal together .
we &apos;ll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
my wife wouldn &apos;t k@@ is@@ s me for the last two months .
we also need to mo@@ bili@@ ze afri@@ cans in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , not only to go into the traditional se@@ ctors , but to go into agriculture and also to inst@@ ig@@ ate change from within .
so , i wonder , is it possible that in the future , the hig@@ gs field will under@@ go a phase transition and , through quantum tun@@ n@@ eling , will be trans@@ formed into this na@@ sty , ultra@@ -@@ den@@ se state ?
so they use po@@ st-@@ its or exc@@ el or facebook .
co : so tor@@ na@@ does don &apos;t happen in massa@@ ch@@ usetts .
most are non-@@ violent and they fall into two bro@@ ad categ@@ ories : active engagement with eth@@ ni@@ c ri@@ val@@ ries and religi@@ ous belie@@ fs and fair , transpar@@ ent economic development and pro@@ vision@@ ing of services .
another stati@@ stic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
when i began recor@@ ding in the late &apos; 60s , the typical metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding were limited to the frag@@ mented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like ma@@ mm@@ als and am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans .
in a nuclear power plant , you have a big po@@ t of water that &apos;s under high pressure , and you have some fuel ro@@ ds , and these fuel ro@@ ds are en@@ cas@@ ed in zir@@ con@@ ium , and they &apos;re little p@@ el@@ lets of ur@@ ani@@ um di@@ oxide fuel , and a fis@@ sion reaction is controll@@ ed and main@@ ta@@ ined at a pro@@ per level , and that reaction he@@ ats up water , the water turns to ste@@ am , ste@@ am turns the tur@@ b@@ ine , and you produce electricity from it .
when i run it through my lab , this he@@ at@@ -@@ mapping shows everything is intelli@@ gi@@ ble .
for instance , you see the spec@@ tra@@ l line of the gold is the only spec@@ tra@@ l line in the spectrum of the sun .
and 30 years later i was sitting in an airplane , next to a lady called ver@@ on@@ ic@@ a , who came from chi@@ le , and we were on a human rights tour , and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tor@@ tured , and , from my very privile@@ ged position , this was the only reference point that i had .
mar@@ du@@ k tells cy@@ rus that he will do these great , gener@@ ous things of setting the people free .
we talk about ourselves as om@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
the pr@@ us@@ si@@ an pe@@ as@@ an@@ try said , &quot; we can &apos;t even get the dogs to eat these dam@@ n things .
it was a match .
mi@@ a says , &quot; when my class@@ mates write a pres@@ cri@@ ption , they think their work is done .
so with that pre@@ am@@ ble , i want to go into disc@@ us@@ sing the two most profound social trends .
but what , you may ask , do a poli@@ sh po@@ et , a british dame , a country music hall of fam@@ er all have in common bes@@ i@@ des this totally excell@@ ent google ran@@ king ?
i wish for her to be a nur@@ se . &quot;
like a lot of parents , our kids are something like ber@@ mu@@ da tri@@ angl@@ es .
it &apos;s si@@ mul@@ taneously an incredible medical techni@@ que , but also a terri@@ fying ...
you know , as for me , my wife and i have our own crazy leg@@ acy project .
as a kid , i was fascin@@ ated with all things air and space .
so this was one particular problem they talked about , that it might be used in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately .
and that &apos;s how my relationship with corruption really began .
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
now you were at those negoti@@ ating tab@@ les when they weren &apos;t , when there was maybe you -- one voice , maybe one or two others .
kir@@ by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on : embra@@ ce the re@@ mix
if there &apos;s a you@@ tu@@ be@@ -@@ like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zi@@ p code specific -- where people could join together , and through satellite ima@@ ging systems , through virtual earth or google earth , you could con@@ fir@@ m carbon cre@@ di@@ ts are being sequ@@ est@@ ered by the trees that are coming through life boxes .
we &apos;re having a debate .
and what marine ma@@ mm@@ als have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to dep@@ end on sound to both expl@@ ore their world and also to stay in touch with one another .
i was separ@@ ated , lar@@ gely , from my family , including my mother and father .
they communicate their de@@ light to their children , who respond with s@@ miles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more .
the other was micro@@ soft .
we &apos;re all hi@@ v-@@ positive .
and the debate un@@ se@@ tt@@ les everybody in the 19@@ th century to realize that the he@@ bre@@ w scri@@ p@@ tures are part of a much wi@@ der world of religion .
and the closer we look at anything , the more it disappe@@ ars .
our lives dep@@ end upon these creatures .
so , i made this for ted . it &apos;s &quot; chri@@ stian . &quot;
but now , as they say in inf@@ om@@ er@@ ci@@ als , we have something much better for you , which we &apos;re working on : planes that are only six in@@ ches -- 15 c@@ enti@@ meters -- in size .
if astron@@ om@@ ers were fro@@ gs perhaps they &apos;d see ker@@ mit the fro@@ g .
then at a certain moment , the door opened and she walked out perfectly dres@@ sed , completely com@@ posed .
this is a typical insu@@ lin in@@ je@@ ction .
12 weeks : in@@ different pen@@ is -- girl or boy yet to be determin@@ ed 8 months deli@@ very : the ex@@ pul@@ sion stage the moment of birth thank you .
and he actually took one look at my squ@@ ig@@ gly line , and said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just embra@@ ce the shake ? &quot;
so let &apos;s see what some of those in@@ ventions were .
you &apos;ve got to look at the out@@ puts , and you got to say to yourself , &quot; what can i do to produce that particular output ? &quot;
and here are the lo@@ w-@@ power poses .
so literally what you &apos;re seeing now is the con@@ flu@@ ence of a bunch of different people , a bunch of different memories , including my own , of taking a little bit of liber@@ ty with the subject matter .
they &apos;re responsible for this video , &quot; here it goes again . &quot;
there &apos;s just one problem .
that time the it@@ ur@@ i forest was created as a forest reser@@ ve with some animals and also plants .
it re@@ minds us that we know we can do better .
wil@@ de@@ be@@ ests don &apos;t hang with li@@ ons because li@@ ons eat wil@@ de@@ be@@ ests .
and i got a lot , like 30 in a half an hour .
this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate circu@@ it made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being ba@@ th@@ ed in a sub@@ stance .
and o@@ ct@@ op@@ us are , they live in all the oceans .
i &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
the sun is over@@ head , maximum he@@ ating , maximum ev@@ apo@@ ration , maximum clouds , maximum rain@@ fall , maximum opportunities for re@@ production .
and he took schwar@@ z@@ schil@@ d &apos;s idea to the pr@@ us@@ si@@ an acade@@ my of sci@@ ences the next week .
so this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the cosmic background explor@@ er -- made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were lar@@ ge-@@ scale flu@@ ctu@@ ations , and actually flu@@ ctu@@ ations on several sc@@ ales . you can kind of see that .
so it &apos;s what we call fre@@ el@@ o@@ ading .
in china , the definition of liter@@ acy is the ability to read and write 1,500 chinese characters .
even with all that — excell@@ ent treatment , wonderful family and friends , suppor@@ tive work environment — i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life , and that &apos;s because the st@@ ig@@ ma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn &apos;t feel safe with people knowing .
aff@@ ord@@ able is not a 4@@ 0,000 dollar se@@ dan , right ?
but then , if we shift the di@@ al 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolutely healthy and gor@@ geous , forming spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ular structures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per di@@ ve .
but let &apos;s swi@@ vel around and look at me fron@@ t@@ ally .
although they &apos;re part of the plastic , they &apos;re not co@@ val@@ ently bon@@ ded to the plastic back@@ bone .
don &apos;t read them bed@@ time stories every night .
can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the al@@ ham@@ bra ?
but here it is un@@ written by law .
so to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language .
and we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy .
but , little did i know , until i jump@@ ed for the first time in a marine reser@@ ve .
i didn &apos;t look the part .
but that doesn &apos;t tell us too much , so we actually cl@@ one the whole thing .
today , much of mexi@@ can society is in den@@ ial of the situation we &apos;re going through .
the planets which are mar@@ ked &quot; like earth , &quot; &#91; are &#93; defin@@ itely more than any other planets that we see .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know@@ -@@ how out there .
okay . get ready .
and something else that happens is that those ima@@ ge-@@ making regi@@ ons where you have the pl@@ ot@@ ting of all these neu@@ ral maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of pur@@ ple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make recor@@ ds of what went on in those is@@ lands of ima@@ ge-@@ making .
we don &apos;t have that . so that &apos;s one problem .
but in 198@@ 9 , he team@@ ed up with bill jo@@ y@@ ce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer .
so , around this time i was studying computer science at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on university , and i notic@@ ed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal arti@@ facts , not just from street cor@@ ners , but also from the internet .
outside , we &apos;d have to re@@ he@@ ar@@ se running away , or learn to stay still like stat@@ ues , giving no clu@@ es that we were there .
construction play -- it &apos;s pla@@ y@@ ful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
i mean , youtube is just a gold mine .
in there he talked about the divided self .
taking tests is stres@@ s@@ ful , but bub@@ bl@@ ing in a scan@@ tr@@ on does not stop bul@@ lets from bur@@ sting .
they travel down roads .
i just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
&quot; and move your normal hand . &quot;
it &apos;s called ch@@ un@@ king .
and without ski@@ pping a beat at all , he said , &quot; well , they &apos;d be about the same .
also , every time you buy gas@@ ol@@ ine in the united states , half of it is actually being refin@@ ed along the coast , because the gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refin@@ ing capacity and a lot of our marine termin@@ als as well .
what about caus@@ ality ?
all right , pick one , last qu@@ est : shake someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
but i &apos;m not . i &apos;m capable of thinking anything .
so we recently pres@@ ented the ma@@ ster plan , and it has gotten appro@@ ved .
i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells , and was trying to look for ways we could inno@@ v@@ ate and make solar cells more in@@ expen@@ si@@ vely .
so i started a project called life edi@@ ted at life@@ edi@@ ted@@ .@@ or@@ g to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
and there is a vari@@ ant of this gene that is in the normal population .
so here &apos;s another example . this one &apos;s somewhat more som@@ ber .
i believe that photograph@@ y can make a real connection to people , and can be emplo@@ yed as a positive ag@@ ent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today .
indian institu@@ tes and edu@@ ca@@ tional system , with a few ex@@ cep@@ tions , are in@@ capable of producing students in the quanti@@ ty and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going , so companies are finding innovative ways to over@@ come this , but in the end it does not ab@@ solve the government of the responsibility for creating this edu@@ ca@@ tional structure .
in fact , it appeared in a por@@ no com@@ ic book , which is the slide on the right .
so what actually works ?
and as you bring these trends together , and as you think of what it means to take people who are pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dea@@ f , who can now begin to hear -- i mean , remember the evolution of hearing aids , right ?
if we could make new pictures in the sky , what would we draw ?
now this , we make lots and lots of pump@@ s .
i mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s harv@@ est -- we say we harv@@ est the pig , you know ?
just have a look at the plants .
okay ? but we were just getting started , the kids loved the technology , so we called up george and we said , &quot; we got@@ ta learn more ! &quot;
and that &apos;s a project that is just about to open next week , the new home for the d@@ all@@ as theater center , the de@@ e and charles w@@ y@@ ly the@@ at@@ re .
so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investig@@ ate how dung be@@ et@@ les deal with these problems .
i met a father the other day ; he looked a little cra@@ zed .
so this non-@@ le@@ th@@ al wea@@ pon was being used , in fact , in this case as a le@@ th@@ al force multi@@ pli@@ er to make kill@@ ing more effective in this particular situation .
and it &apos;s got a comm@@ ents se@@ ction here where we can sub@@ mit comm@@ ents to the website .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
the twi@@ st is that one player , on the left , is in@@ formed about how much on each trial there is .
there &apos;s new programm@@ ability in these parts .
well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
but for the time being , thank you for that .
you can ear@@ n 60 euro@@ s . isn &apos;t that great ? yes or no ? &quot;
oce@@ an@@ ograph@@ er paul s@@ n@@ el@@ gro@@ ve shares the results of a ten@@ -@@ year project with one goal : to take a cen@@ sus of all the life in the oceans . he shares amazing photos of some of the surprising fin@@ ds of the cen@@ sus of marine life .
now , the next question that you would like to ask is : what would you like to measure ? what would you like to analy@@ ze ?
that technology is si@@ mul@@ ating humans .
this is a la@@ undry ch@@ ute , and this right here is a sho@@ e last .
there &apos;s a little le@@ dge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is fil@@ ling it up like that .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college near@@ by -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the par@@ king lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
so , my clo@@ sing thought .
well , amaz@@ ingly , for once , our world leaders actually lived up to that millenni@@ um moment and back in 2000 agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff : vision@@ ary , meas@@ ur@@ able , long-term targets called the millenni@@ um development goals .
you can click on every single equ@@ ation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it , tin@@ ker with it , understand it , because we really don &apos;t understand until we do .
he co@@ ached little leagu@@ e for our son .
there &apos;s a revolution going on .
independent diplom@@ at is now estab@@ li@@ shed in five diplo@@ matic cen@@ ters around the world , and we &apos;re ad@@ vis@@ ing seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depen@@ ding on how you wish to define them -- and i &apos;m not big on defini@@ tions .
he &apos;s still ahead of some of the stuff that &apos;s being done now .
when extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about pic@@ ni@@ cs -- then extra ants are allo@@ cated to collect the food .
i like to think of it as a kind of technological magic .
that is my in@@ vention .
and yet , everything in this ca@@ ve has adap@@ ted to it .
i tried to call deep on my courage .
so the quanti@@ ta@@ tive results were great .
rory suther@@ land : now , natur@@ ally , a debate ra@@ ged .
let me tell you another thing we could do .
if you have a b@@ out of depression , you &apos;ll go to the right side .
but 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later , my bo@@ ss said i could do it on the side , as a sort of a play project , k@@ ick the ti@@ res of a new computer we &apos;d got .
the two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world .
we shot a space probe at it and hit it . okay ?
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to condu@@ ct my own music with this new software .
in this energi@@ zing talk , am@@ ory lo@@ v@@ ins la@@ ys out his simple plan for we@@ an@@ ing the us off oil and re@@ vit@@ ali@@ zing the economy .
&quot; now you &apos;re showing your true colors , &quot; mom says . she thin@@ ks , &quot; why does he take after his dad ? &quot;
i &apos;ve become the crazy wr@@ ong@@ ness lady .
so sol@@ es , i think we need a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um of big questions .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of p@@ ill@@ ars and hot spr@@ ings and vol@@ can@@ ic er@@ up@@ tions and earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , in@@ hab@@ ited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
okay ? there &apos;s sugar in everything .
and then i did some vari@@ ations of it , but it still wasn &apos;t co@@ al@@ es@@ cing graphi@@ cally at all .
save more tomorrow inv@@ it@@ es emplo@@ ye@@ es to save more maybe next year -- some@@ time in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating ban@@ anas , volunte@@ ering more in the community , ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ ing more and doing all the right things on the planet .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
this is a picture of , actually rory sa@@ y@@ res &apos; gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s brain .
there &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense .
i didn &apos;t have the fra@@ me@@ work .
since then , i &apos;ve had the great pleas@@ ure of working with the googl@@ ers , with do@@ er marine , with national geographic , with do@@ zens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could en@@ list , to put the ocean in google earth .
he was a mathemati@@ cian on a mission .
we &apos;ve got ideas about how to fix these er@@ r@@ ors .
it can only be a state of being , not just a fle@@ eting emotion , sen@@ sation .
it had a revolution@@ ary pro@@ s@@ thetic fit@@ ment and deli@@ very system , a quick mol@@ ding and mod@@ ular compon@@ ents , en@@ ab@@ ling custom@@ -@@ made , on-@@ the-@@ spo@@ t limb fit@@ ments .
the han identity has been the c@@ ement which has held this country together .
and so what i &apos;m about to show you is an accurate represent@@ ation of the actual dna replic@@ ation machine that &apos;s oc@@ curr@@ ing right now inside your body , at least 2002 biology .
are you able to say in a sent@@ ence or two how this type of thinking could integra@@ te at some point to things like str@@ ing theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explan@@ ations of the universe ?
and this is de@@ tri@@ mental to the local ec@@ ology of the sea area that it &apos;s pump@@ ed back out into .
i mean , we all have h@@ d-@@ capable camer@@ as in our po@@ ckets right now -- most people in this room , i bet -- and it &apos;s something that &apos;s -- i never want to forget another day that i &apos;ve ever lived , and this is my way of doing that , and it &apos;d be really interesting also to see , if you could just type in on a website , &quot; june 18 , 20@@ 18 , &quot; and you would just see a stream of people &apos;s lives on that particular day from all over the world .
it creates people -- when you manipu@@ late inc@@ enti@@ ves to get people to do the right thing -- it creates people who are addi@@ cted to inc@@ enti@@ ves .
so what we really need to do is re@@ gain the idea that it &apos;s our government sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding our interests and re@@ gain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fi@@ ber and so forth , and turn it back into soil and sequ@@ ester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ?
so we have this huge challenge , this huge gap .
this is actually quite meaningful to me , because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the tot@@ em pole -- we don &apos;t do coffee table books with just one lam@@ p inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it &apos;s a little bit difficult to get into the aes@@ thetic side under the same sort of termin@@ ology that one would discuss art .
they climb into the back of the truck . they go off with the person who re@@ cru@@ its them .
i will not l@@ end my name nor my rhyth@@ m to your beat .
the year is 2010 .
that &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
and that tiny little pack@@ et of energy is what they use , then , to run their life process@@ es .
why does this matter ? well first because , for brain dis@@ or@@ ders , behavior is the last thing to change .
what these things have in common is that kids will take a chance .
the algorith@@ m mat@@ ched us up because we share a love of g@@ ad@@ gets , we share a love of math and data and &apos; 8@@ 0s music , and so i agreed to go out with him .
you go to the hotel and you check in . there &apos;s a le@@ ban@@ ese .
we have a challenge , because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time . people are moving to the cities .
these inclu@@ de mas@@ sage , dancing and pra@@ ying .
if you stick around , then good lu@@ ck .
the next move was that we wanted to try and ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the size of those h@@ ex@@ ag@@ ons .
and that &apos;s a very powerful thing . pro@@ gr@@ ession is powerful .
and you can measure the performance , in terms of energy consumption , of that building against a typical library .
but it &apos;s also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ; they are able to sense .
it wasn &apos;t a virtual cho@@ ir .
gold@@ fish s@@ wa@@ m .
i was blind , i couldn &apos;t speak , and i couldn &apos;t walk .
it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a law@@ yer .
they don &apos;t want to feel like they need to take a sho@@ wer to get the moral gri@@ me off their bodies everyday when they come home from work .
it was big enough to be transpar@@ ent to light , and that &apos;s what we see in the cosmic micro@@ wave background that george smo@@ ot described as looking at the face of god .
and i was ro@@ tat@@ ing it in 3d and saying , &quot; i understand now . &quot;
remember i said it r@@ uns in families ?
ni@@ c mar@@ ks : the happy planet index
so every year , instead of just teaching our students , we also have a well@@ ness week .
just a few quick before and after sh@@ ots .
the pil@@ gri@@ ms come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they &apos;re not going to get in tru@@ cks and bu@@ ses and go down there .
so , the water bottle .
in india in 1960 , there was a 24 percent child mortality rate , lots of people didn &apos;t make it . this is incredibly un@@ fortunate .
and does it happen anywhere else ?
it &apos;s made of light and sha@@ do@@ w .
imagine a network of neurons with one neuro@@ mod@@ ul@@ ator .
the stories we were hearing got us to the south pole .
well , she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center , in a re@@ ception area , in a mail room .
it turns out , all sorts of things .
because typically they &apos;ve been too in@@ efficient , in@@ ac@@ c@@ essi@@ ble , they &apos;ve not been fast enough , they &apos;ve been quite expensive .
this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanze@@ e .
sometimes inter@@ species cl@@ ones have res@@ pi@@ ration problems .
for his brilliant eff@@ or@@ ts , he was nearly im@@ pe@@ ached .
this is a completely programm@@ able and adap@@ tive pi@@ pe on its own .
so what will happen now is what we call &quot; the big fil@@ l-@@ up . &quot;
now i realize -- i &apos;m not saying -- health and education -- no , you can also provide that as well .
in other words , we have these hi@@ jack@@ ers -- you &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a par@@ asi@@ te that infe@@ cts the brain and indu@@ ces even suici@@ d@@ al behavior on be@@ half of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fit@@ ness .
we find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
but if it weren &apos;t for the stran@@ gely familiar sto@@ mach@@ -@@ chur@@ ning od@@ or that constantly pas@@ ses through the apartment , it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a co@@ w shed and on top of a land@@ fill .
and the rest of the year they &apos;re free to ro@@ am around edu@@ ardo &apos;s land and eat what they want .
and when it &apos;s ready to harv@@ est , you take it out of the bat@@ h and you was@@ h it in cold , so@@ ap@@ y water .
not just about its gene@@ tics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
the difference between the dinosau@@ rs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
these guys can tell us .
if you want to know about africa , read our liter@@ ature -- and not just &quot; things fall apart , &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
obviously , i &apos;m having a fabul@@ ous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
but before i do that , i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like pla@@ stics , which requi@@ re huge amo@@ un@@ ts of energy to create and , because of their dis@@ pos@@ al issues , are slowly po@@ is@@ on@@ ing our planet .
now , the machine is -- in this case , it &apos;s a real appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tion of that , because obviously you can &apos;t move physical matter infin@@ itely with infin@@ ite speed and have it stop inst@@ ant@@ an@@ eously .
just before we jump into that , there &apos;s sort of a question of : why is this important ?
and she went , &quot; haha . there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
and some of the wat@@ ches there , attemp@@ ting to be beautiful and hu@@ mor@@ ous -- maybe not attemp@@ ting , hopefully succe@@ eding .
and it &apos;s very hard to find an eth@@ ic@@ ist who consi@@ ders any change worth making , because he says , what about the con@@ sequences ?
it &apos;s a huge opportunity for trans@@ forma@@ tional development .
here &apos;s chris &apos; clock .
and it stru@@ ck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and inter@@ connected , that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference .
stop . do you see the pattern ?
there they are today .
that was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country .
so let &apos;s switch back to that .
and that is a fe@@ at that we are not really conscious of that much .
it pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts . something is going on here .
and that is what lin@@ ked data is all about .
for example , in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent angiogen@@ esis -- not enough blood ves@@ sel@@ s -- leads to wo@@ unds that don &apos;t he@@ al , heart attacks , legs without circu@@ lation , death from stro@@ ke , ner@@ ve damage .
and you get a sense of out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ body experience .
so val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day is coming up in a couple of days , and these are currently arri@@ ving in ma@@ il@@ boxes all around the world .
and that &apos;s where it &apos;s actually also interesting to think about , where does 40@@ 4 come from ?
of course , we can &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen and we have to live with un@@ certain@@ ty .
and the art of conversation is being replac@@ ed -- danger@@ ously , i think -- by personal bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting .
and speaking of design , you notice that i already bro@@ a@@ den@@ ed the discussion .
and then of course there was sha@@ h ru@@ k@@ h playing the kol@@ kat@@ a crowd .
for wind , there &apos;s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a ful@@ l-@@ time writer , as many people know .
no protection .
and over the course of dinner , i learned that ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i ga@@ ins most of its re@@ venue -- it &apos;s a very poor country -- but it ga@@ ins what re@@ venue is has by s@@ elling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters , because ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i does not have the capacity to take the fish itself .
a few years ago , professor vac@@ la@@ v s@@ mi@@ l tried to calculate the prob@@ ability of sudden dis@@ ast@@ ers large enough to change history .
and econom@@ ists -- for@@ give me , for those of you who play the lot@@ tery -- but econom@@ ists , at least among themselves , re@@ fer to the lot@@ tery as a stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty ta@@ x , because the od@@ ds of getting any pa@@ yo@@ ff by invest@@ ing your money in a lot@@ tery ti@@ cket are appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely equivalent to fl@@ us@@ hing the money directly down the toi@@ let -- which , by the way , doesn &apos;t requi@@ re that you actually go to the store and buy anything .
and then some che@@ ery sou@@ l usually always pi@@ pes up and says , &quot; hey , don &apos;t forget about pla@@ gu@@ es . &quot;
so we &apos;re really challen@@ ged on what we &apos;re doing there .
or the color@@ a@@ do river , which no longer flo@@ ws to the ocean .
now , in this parado@@ x between love and desire , what seems to be so puzz@@ ling is that the very ingredients that nur@@ ture love -- mu@@ tu@@ ality , reci@@ pro@@ city , protection , worry , responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stif@@ le desire .
their diet is mostly plan@@ t-@@ based , ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated with fo@@ ods that they can carry into the fields .
music is the language of emotions .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t enjoy anything after that .
her mother , that &apos;s right .
i began the spe@@ ech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nas@@ h@@ ville .
because democracy depen@@ ds on an in@@ formed citi@@ zen@@ ship .
the information was inside my house and it was awesome .
so one of the very first things we teach people in econom@@ ics and statistics and business and psych@@ ology cour@@ ses is how , in a stati@@ st@@ ically val@@ id way , do we elimin@@ ate the weir@@ dos .
it actually got harder .
she wanted to keep far@@ ming until she dies .
it &apos;ll take a few years to prove it , experiment@@ ally , but i &apos;m going to try .
j@@ h : so no@@ te how bra@@ d@@ ley &apos;s pe@@ tty , mor@@ ali@@ stic self just dies on the way up the sta@@ ir@@ case .
she stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liber@@ ation , and in the pal@@ m of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
so if somebody could see it , you could say , here &apos;s how the machine works , here &apos;s what we do , and then here &apos;s what happens .
in generations .
there was some bom@@ b shel@@ ter built , appar@@ ently in the &apos; 60s cu@@ ban mis@@ si@@ le crisis .
and we have one .
we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to imple@@ ment this and move it forward .
and there &apos;s about three hack@@ er@@ spac@@ es or more in de@@ troit .
we can &apos;t guaran@@ tee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
every single use therefore requ@@ ir@@ es permission ; without permission , you are a tr@@ es@@ pas@@ ser .
the first is to create a kind of balloon structure , fill it with bacteria , then allow the sand to was@@ h over the balloon , po@@ p the balloon , as it were , dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating the bacteria into the sand and soli@@ di@@ fying it .
i don &apos;t have a good answer for this one .
it &apos;s man@@ -@@ made and can be over@@ come and er@@ adi@@ cated by the actions of human beings . &quot;
and six , the work eth@@ ic .
that &apos;s kind of too much effort .
pre@@ vi@@ ously known as the department of foreign propaganda , the state coun@@ cil information office is responsible for all of china &apos;s ex@@ tern@@ al publi@@ city oper@@ ations .
batter@@ y-@@ powered , it is sil@@ ent and r@@ ar@@ ely notic@@ ed .
lap@@ top@@ s , computers , tab@@ lets -- you name it , they have it .
to sell his idea , he became a sho@@ w@@ man .
today , i want you to look at children who become suici@@ de bom@@ bers through a completely different lens .
this isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple demonstration .
and i know u.@@ s@@ .@@ -@@ china relations doesn &apos;t need another law@@ yer .
now this brings me to a basic categ@@ ori@@ zation in the way scientific disco@@ ver@@ ies are made .
it feels like i &apos;ve land@@ ed in a col@@ ony of angel@@ s . &quot;
i want to help you . &quot;
i just pil@@ ed them up .
often , our theor@@ ies fa@@ il quite miser@@ ably when we go to the data .
to me , this ob@@ s@@ ession is the source and root of all of our produ@@ ctivity and crea@@ tivity .
it was in a big pa@@ vili@@ on in green@@ ville , an in@@ door pa@@ vili@@ on , and i went to it because i was so frustrated as go@@ ver@@ nor that i couldn &apos;t stop the out@@ flow of these jobs , and i wanted to grie@@ ve with them , and as i went into the ro@@ om@@ -- there &apos;s thousands of people there .
and it &apos;s a kind of water body for all se@@ as@@ ons .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to try and do .
and of course , lo@@ wer@@ ing child mortality is a matter of u@@ t@@ most importance from human@@ it@@ arian aspe@@ cts .
so , pri@@ zes work great .
and now look at this second set of sli@@ des .
and what i mean by that , it &apos;s the behavi@@ ors that we &apos;re in den@@ ial about , and the ones that oper@@ ate below the surface of our da@@ ily awareness .
hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
it takes a pi@@ le of loo@@ se sand and it creates sand@@ stone out of it .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , they &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , they &apos;ve seen lots of deaths . how do they answer this question ?
a restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant .
it is the project of questi@@ on@@ ing what we believe and why we believe it -- what so@@ cr@@ ates called &quot; the exam@@ ined life . &quot;
with all apo@@ logi@@ es to my friend mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u ri@@ card , a shop@@ ping m@@ all full of zen mon@@ ks is not going to be particularly prof@@ itable because they don &apos;t want stuff enough .
tho@@ m may@@ ne : howard ? i &apos;m sitting next to howard . i don &apos;t know howard , obviously , and he &apos;s going , i hope you &apos;re not next .
and instead of son@@ y blo@@ cking , they allowed the u@@ plo@@ ad to occu@@ r .
but lat@@ ely , the do@@ ors of the pal@@ ace have been fl@@ ung open , and the walls are coming down .
my only wish that night was to co@@ ok a meal for him , and that night i also thought of what else i could do to honor him .
and we &apos;ve got pretty good vac@@ cin@@ es , as i &apos;ve just showed you .
well , i can feel it , it &apos;s doing all right -- i don &apos;t have to check it .
don &apos;t try to sell to the poor kids ; they don &apos;t have cas@@ h . the rich people do . go get some .
another shape is made for cancer .
so i found that they had a friend , a local accoun@@ t@@ ant , a young girl , and they played football with her .
and the familiar illu@@ stration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a spor@@ ts stadium and the next atom is in the next spor@@ ts stadium .
it &apos;s really a wh@@ olly separate radiation .
they &apos;re completely natural .
this is ed day putting ... so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c@@ 4 in it .
we discovered a pro@@ fusion of life , in a world that it should not exist &#91; in &#93; . giant tube wor@@ ms , 10 feet t@@ all .
great person .
lots of complex stuff .
i &apos;ve got a real est@@ ate problem .
when i went this morning to lar@@ ry brilliant &apos;s tedtalk prize -- his fabul@@ ous networks -- imagine if there was an open-@@ source mes@@ h communic@@ ations device that can be put into those networks , to make all that happen .
so i began looking around for -- to see if anyone sold a k@@ it , some kind of model that i could get , and i found lots of reference material , lots of lo@@ vely pictures .
and the world health organization also says that depression is the biggest epide@@ mic that human@@ kind has ever fac@@ ed .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civili@@ zation these days , they &apos;re not going to do it with tan@@ ks .
look a decade ago , look two decades ago : marke@@ dly different .
how then can we en@@ sure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an un@@ fair advan@@ tage of those who are already most affected by the pande@@ mic ?
i mean , that &apos;s a fine lo@@ gic , that sounds pretty convin@@ cing , pretty ir@@ on@@ cla@@ d , doesn &apos;t it ?
and a few years ago , i was walking in tel a@@ vi@@ v and i saw this gra@@ ff@@ iti on a wall , and i found it so comp@@ elling that by now i pre@@ ach it to my students , and i &apos;d like to try to pre@@ ach it to you .
and it is robert kenne@@ dy &apos;s beautiful descri@@ ption of why gross national product cap@@ tures so little : it &quot; does not allow for the health of our children , the quality of their education , or the joy of their play .
and they asked me how was it , and i say to them , &quot; it was good , &quot; and i zi@@ p my pan@@ ts up in front of them , and i head for the door .
see what &apos;s really puzz@@ ling and fru@@ str@@ ating about the last mile , to me , is that the first 9@@ 99 miles are all about science .
that &apos;s the wrong answer .
you &apos;ve got to come up and see them .
we lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years .
what is buddh@@ ism but 2,@@ 500 years of em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal obser@@ vation as to the nature of mind ?
do you want to try it ?
today these low pri@@ ces are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 6@@ 2 countries , and about 5@@ 50,000 people are getting the benef@@ its of them .
zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow , tell various stories through different medi@@ ums .
but i had always felt like , look , you know , i made the best choice i could make given who i was then , given the information i had on hand .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i try to do .
in del@@ hi , we used to live -- we used to call it a ch@@ hat or the k@@ hot@@ a .
now june the nin@@ th , 2009 , we got the first results from the first trial with this vac@@ cine , and it turned out to be a g@@ am@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger .
some of them will be cop@@ i@@ ed even though they &apos;re not .
now , in one sense , the claim that history has a direction is not that contro@@ versi@@ al .
but it &apos;s not just the car@@ bon@@ ate produ@@ cers that are affected .
she &apos;s not sure that would have happened if the edi@@ tor had not been a female .
here &apos;s a map made by mark gra@@ ham who &apos;s down the street at the ox@@ ford internet institute .
i think it &apos;s not the only ingre@@ dient in design , but possibly the most important .
i think you &apos;re a person who believ@@ es in your leg@@ acy .
so without noise redu@@ ction technology , our country would not exist .
so those are examples of positive inter@@ ventions .
so , thank you . another person , another card .
and those bu@@ mp@@ s act like a mag@@ net for water .
we &apos;re also sele@@ cting for brains in which we can get the tissue , we can get con@@ sent to take the tissue within 24 hours of time of death .
because the kids can &apos;t learn , they look for other things to distra@@ ct their attention .
and one area that i think is very interesting , which many of you may have now that we &apos;ve thro@@ wn microbes into the crowd , is something that i would call &quot; ger@@ m@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot;
oh yes ? why not ?
because i feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clo@@ th@@ es out there .
but we wanted it to look at atoms , at ir@@ on atoms , so that we could read the page from before and after .
to give you a quick pri@@ mer on where we are , a quick re@@ fres@@ her on where we are .
the first building ? well , there &apos;s nobody there .
does it make a difference if war@@ ri@@ ors go to battle changing their appe@@ ar@@ ance or not ?
we don &apos;t go home at the end of the day and think , &quot; well , i really know who i am now because the wall street journ@@ al says that the stock exchange closed at this many points . &quot;
the explor@@ ers s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ed the bra@@ ves . sweeney : horri@@ bly .
and somehow , through some dynamic effect , we &apos;re having these ge@@ y@@ s@@ ers which are being , you know , em@@ it@@ ted from it .
these are chemical clo@@ cks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
so after five days of cros@@ sing the dra@@ ke passage -- isn &apos;t that beautiful .
zero dollars a month .
i mean , can you picture a politi@@ cian standing up in britain and saying , &quot; g@@ d@@ p fell two percent this year . good news !
you go into an area like this , you get a ge@@ ologi@@ c map , you get a topo@@ graphi@@ c map , and the best , mo@@ st-@@ inspired team you can bring to the area .
so to comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te , i &apos;d hold the pen ti@@ ghter , and this pro@@ gr@@ essi@@ vely made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen ti@@ ghter still .
instead of just seeing the travel grow , we can use innovative pri@@ cing , char@@ ging for road infrastructure by the mile , not by the g@@ all@@ on .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile sub@@ scri@@ p@@ tions .
generally the first dog can be relatively content .
and i think now you &apos;re seeing the move towards impro@@ ving our cities .
you have a 3d camera , so you get a 3d view .
so if i pick the same comm@@ and through many times , i will get a different no@@ is@@ y version each time , because noise changes each time .
and so here i am .
this is a new@@ t re-@@ growing its limb .
and anything you see in the book , you can pick up with two fing@@ ers and li@@ ft off the page and open up .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
so you were for@@ war@@ ding on . you didn &apos;t have control .
and this stuff is moving very quickly , and by the way , that thing can carry about 3@@ 50 pounds of weight .
when scot@@ t hei@@ fer@@ man fo@@ unded me@@ e@@ tu@@ p , he thought it would be used for , you know , train spo@@ t@@ ters and c@@ at fan@@ ci@@ ers -- classic aff@@ in@@ ity groups .
there &apos;s a whole family of cur@@ ves here .
compassion can be sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous with empathy .
in stun@@ ning lar@@ ge-@@ format photographs , ed@@ ward bur@@ t@@ yn@@ sky follo@@ ws the path of oil through modern society , from well@@ head to pi@@ p@@ eline to car engine -- and then beyond to the proje@@ cted pe@@ ak@@ -@@ oil end@@ game .
chri@@ stop@@ her mc@@ dou@@ g@@ all explor@@ es the myster@@ ies of the human desire to run . how did running help early humans survive -- and what ur@@ ges from our ancient ance@@ stors spur us on today ? mc@@ dou@@ g@@ all tells the story of the mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er with a heart of gold , the unlikely ultra@@ -@@ run@@ ner , and the hid@@ den tri@@ be in mexico that r@@ uns to live . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , the interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away , it &apos;s as if you haven &apos;t learned anything in the last minute .
we want to be with you and across from you .
and it took them four days .
for example , fe@@ e-@@ b@@ ates , a com@@ bin@@ ation of a fe@@ e and a re@@ b@@ ate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of in@@ efficient vehi@@ cles and cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly pay you a re@@ b@@ ate for efficient vehi@@ cles .
alli@@ son g@@ ins@@ bur@@ g : good evening .
this takes energy , producing clean water .
they don &apos;t understand what the hell it &apos;s about .
and we don &apos;t do it because there are so many of us . we don &apos;t co@@ ordin@@ ate .
and this is -- at least , to a traditional econom@@ ist -- somewhat remarkable , because the traditional account of economic man would say that , basically , you do things for a con@@ crete re@@ ward , pri@@ mar@@ ily financial .
in fact , the week afterwards , some ta@@ x cu@@ ts were done that made the situation even worse than their assu@@ mp@@ tions .
so , everybody can r@@ ank these mon@@ et prin@@ ts from the one they like the most , to the one they like the least .
but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by exper@@ ts in 20@@ 16 , that this sch@@ ism between the political and economic ide@@ ologi@@ es of the west and the rest is likely to wi@@ den .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
here are stres@@ s-@@ stra@@ in cur@@ ves gener@@ ated by ten@@ si@@ le testing five fi@@ bers made by the same spider .
i will show it to you .
the teams do a great job , and that &apos;s their work .
and if you engine@@ er what they do you can change the world , you can get a better result .
the good projects , which we as a don@@ or community would take under our wings , they took years , you know , you had too many studies , and very often they didn &apos;t succeed .
it also has a friend near@@ by -- well , i think they &apos;re friends .
because when tan@@ kers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point , so when they &apos;re emp@@ ty , they have the ballast water in there .
he &apos;s turning 50 this year , and he &apos;s convin@@ ced that the rich ta@@ pe@@ stry of re@@ pu@@ tation he &apos;s built on air@@ b@@ n@@ b will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life .
if you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it off@@ ered you some war@@ m@@ th , some food , shel@@ ter , and maybe the car@@ ing attention of a nur@@ se .
but if you need to reach more places than just one , you need to move the robot .
but the truth was that as this start becoming popular , a couple ri@@ ght@@ wing blogs and some message boar@@ ds appar@@ ently found it to be a little pat@@ r@@ oni@@ zing , which i could also see .
if that had been a dog , i would have la@@ id him out .
some people would argu@@ e that today there is still no equal rights .
this may sound like simple ad@@ vice , but hardly anyone does that , and it &apos;s incredibly hel@@ p@@ ful .
i present to you an ex@@ cer@@ pt of that work &quot; sim@@ han@@ and@@ in@@ i . &quot;
and we ate an aw@@ ful lot of the swe@@ et po@@ tat@@ oes .
and i simply said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry .
these mem@@ bran@@ es are also quite similar , mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally and func@@ tionally , to the mem@@ bran@@ es in your body , and we can use these , as they say , to form the body of our proto@@ cell .
i am going to ci@@ te the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience .
and the earli@@ est evidence for it cro@@ ps up somewhere between 80 and 1@@ 20,000 years ago in africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long di@@ stances in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
modern medicine is in dan@@ ger of losing a powerful , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned tool : human touch . physi@@ cian and writer abraham ver@@ gh@@ ese descri@@ bes our strange new world where patients are mer@@ ely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-@@ on-@@ one physical ex@@ am .
we are a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ hea@@ vy culture in more ways than one .
they were always going to ask me to help them and give them things , which i was excited to do , but i didn &apos;t know how it was going to work .
so , mean@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back typ@@ ing this up , taking it completely ser@@ i@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind .
ok . co@@ ke japan comes out with a new product every three weeks , because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
see , our pattern dete@@ ction device , which appears to be located in the an@@ teri@@ or c@@ ingu@@ late cortex -- it &apos;s our little dete@@ ction device there -- can be easily fo@@ ol@@ ed , and this is the problem .
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
black men ski . black men ski .
this universe is described by being a network of relationships .
that &apos;s why we build space shu@@ tt@@ les and ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extra@@ ct ter@@ mit@@ es .
well , they ori@@ ent to the care@@ gi@@ ver .
so she has to give 10 percent of the mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge -- of the total value , or about 400 dollars in sa@@ v@@ ings .
&quot; oh , he &apos;s bad at studies , but let him send to the drawing competi@@ tions . &quot;
and when i was five , my parents gave me an or@@ ange sch@@ win@@ n st@@ ing-@@ ray bicycle .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green cur@@ ve .
a belo@@ ved grandmother , a lo@@ ver -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end us@@ er .
and it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kin@@ dness .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
back then -- actually my first expedi@@ tion was when i was 17 years old . it was 49 years ago .
it &apos;s not at all clear where it &apos;s going to take us .
artists and inno@@ v@@ ators -- many of the people you &apos;ve seen on this stage .
so there &apos;s some ten@@ sion here between trying to get the most money but trying to go@@ ad the other player into giving you more .
and now , in this experiment they get re@@ war@@ ded if they go to the blue flo@@ wers .
whenever they have a moment they ch@@ at to each other .
this is a us air force he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter particip@@ ating after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 2@@ 50,000 people .
we &apos;re only just holding it together .
it has many contra@@ sts .
it was very difficult not to get sc@@ ared , not to get da@@ un@@ ted .
and then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we ju@@ dge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system .
and the first gene that was ma@@ pped in association studies for this , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set pro@@ state cancer , was this gene called r@@ nas@@ el .
vol@@ ta@@ ire sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed why . he said , &quot; work sa@@ ves us from three great ev@@ ils : bor@@ e@@ dom , vice and need . &quot;
it &apos;s called strong , which is &quot; se@@ cure transpor@@ tation reducing oil needs gradu@@ ally , &quot; and the idea is instead of being hel@@ pl@@ ess , we need to be more strong .
now , when psych@@ ologists show you b@@ ars , you know that they are showing you a@@ ver@@ ages of lots of people .
but in &apos; 9@@ 6 they heard a few weird son@@ gs , and it turned out that these strange son@@ gs were typical of west coast whales .
some of these pain@@ t@@ ings , when you look at them very close , odd things appear that really look like hor@@ ses or birds or cro@@ co@@ di@@ les , elephants .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
maybe these are the deaths that simple re@@ hydra@@ tion alone doesn &apos;t solve . that &apos;s not true either .
you now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medi@@ c@@ alized .
this is an inde@@ x@@ ical regi@@ ster of a lived moment of a body in time .
it ar@@ ises around cra@@ cks in the earth .
the thought of the war@@ far@@ in was really quite fri@@ ghten@@ ing .
and so she ultimately turned to prostit@@ ution .
and whatever happens in this uni@@ qu@@ ely cru@@ cial century will res@@ on@@ ate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth , far beyond the earth as de@@ pic@@ ted here .
and all of it was coming from this : shri@@ mp far@@ ms .
bill ford is a car guy -- his great@@ -@@ grand@@ father was hen@@ ry ford , and he grew up inside the massive ford motor co . so when he wor@@ ries about cars &apos; impact on the environment , and about our growing global gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck problem , it &apos;s worth a listen . his vision for the future of mo@@ bility inclu@@ des &quot; smart roads , &quot; even smar@@ ter public transport and going green like never before .
sometimes we see da@@ ds get more excited than their kids playing with le@@ gos or putting together plastic robots .
and i think once we ask that question we have to go back , actually , to life . because obviously , if we keep exten@@ ding the orig@@ ins of technology far back , i think we come back to life at some point .
if there is only one machine , and our little hand@@ hel@@ ds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically constru@@ cting a single , global machine .
on the back , you see this again .
but with lots of intelligent people foc@@ using on whether food is organic or local , or whether we &apos;re being nice to animals , the most important issues just aren &apos;t being addres@@ sed .
i &apos;d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphor@@ us issue is .
and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest .
why does this happen ?
we have one organis@@ m that lives off of carbon mon@@ oxide , and we use as a reducing power to spli@@ t water to produce hydro@@ gen and oxygen .
so you still get he@@ ated , but you don &apos;t dis@@ si@@ pate any .
and this is ba@@ o@@ steel , right outside of shanghai .
she came to my country and saw the importance of education .
and this pol@@ ar bear stands over the hus@@ ky , no cla@@ ws extended , no fan@@ gs taking a look .
and slowly , i moved out of that miser@@ able state of mind .
but let &apos;s bring it home .
humans invented the idea of hospit@@ als and clinics in the 17@@ 8@@ 0s . it is time to up@@ date our thinking .
daniel go@@ le@@ man : why aren &apos;t we more com@@ passionate ?
basically , we get it out of min@@ es .
and they shel@@ ved the project . and it sat there for 10 years , and then one day ab@@ e spiegel from los angeles , who had lost his three-@@ year-old son at au@@ schwi@@ tz , came , saw the model , wrote the check and it got built 10 years later .
thank you very much .
e : twe@@ et , twe@@ et , twe@@ et .
a friend of mine once said , &quot; you know , a three year-old is not half a six year-old . &quot;
but the extra bon@@ uses that she gets is various infe@@ ctions , sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted infe@@ ctions , hiv , aids , sy@@ phili@@ s , gon@@ or@@ rhe@@ a , you name it , sub@@ stance ab@@ use , drugs , everything under the sun .
so the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and i can up@@ date it in a second .
the first limit@@ ation is the oxygen -- oxygen to@@ xic@@ ity .
we spend right now about 7@@ 50 million to 8@@ 00 million dollars a year .
this can be a factor , and everybody can be saying it &apos;s counter@@ intui@@ tive . it can be a story , it can be experience .
it pretty much covers half the planet .
simil@@ arly , when you put motor output on movement output , it &apos;s extremely no@@ is@@ y .
in this particular case , the source over and over has been flo@@ od bas@@ al@@ ts .
the numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these a@@ vat@@ ars and expl@@ ore objects that appear in the virtual world .
you see something on it . it &apos;s not just to look like a geck@@ o .
the sym@@ b@@ ols are most com@@ mon@@ ly found on se@@ als .
goo@@ d-@@ looking people are always ju@@ d@@ ged as being more friend@@ ly .
someone did all eight videos -- a b@@ ass even singing the sop@@ ran@@ o parts .
and i &apos;d like to think of it as a 21@@ st century wisdom table , really .
well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that &apos;s usually used for cancer , but it can also reve@@ al in@@ fl@@ am@@ ma@@ tion .
that changes everything , right ?
how se@@ cure is the the@@ o@@ cra@@ tic regime in iran ?
it &apos;s open source .
africa was being used as a success story !
it is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
they go on to ja@@ m inno@@ cent gps recei@@ vers for miles around you .
now the ir@@ ony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collabor@@ ative behavi@@ ors that are har@@ d-@@ wired in all of us .
we don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . thank you for coming to ted .
and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identifi@@ cation .
so that &apos;s what you see here .
and that &apos;s one of the reasons why arth@@ ur ander@@ sen cho@@ se to laun@@ ch ac@@ cent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ ade the world that ander@@ sen &apos;s could stand for something other than accoun@@ tan@@ cy .
but i want to take you into one clu@@ ster that &apos;s particularly important to me , and that &apos;s the environment .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed organs .
therefore it &apos;s the ex@@ clu@@ sive pres@@ erve of an eli@@ te , tal@@ ented body .
he really was not inten@@ ding to work in patent research , but he couldn &apos;t really find an alternative technical job .
i &apos;m notic@@ ing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
you know , this is n@@ ollywood , where the magic lives .
now this may sound arro@@ gant , or even full of hu@@ br@@ is .
so if you pull the data from d@@ b@@ pedia about ber@@ lin , you &apos;ll end up pul@@ ling up these other things as well .
some of you might be wonder@@ ing what a cyber@@ security speci@@ alist looks like , and i thought i &apos;d give you a quick in@@ sight into my career so far .
and all the se@@ di@@ ment is then put through these scre@@ ens , and where we go again through it very car@@ efully , looking for small bone frag@@ ments , and it &apos;s then was@@ hed .
and you could expect quite a lot to come from this .
this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care , in fi@@ x@@ ing health care .
well , our vision is to re@@ disco@@ ver the spirit of the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , create a new discipl@@ ine where engineering for cultural her@@ it@@ age is actually a symbol of bl@@ en@@ ding art and science together .
these are just remarkable , remarkable changes in the out@@ look for some of the biggest kill@@ ers .
and after pie@@ cing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and exten@@ ding opportunity to the 70 percent of pakistan@@ is who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pa@@ th@@ ways to hope .
this is : &quot; having &quot; -- this is the same thing ; it &apos;s just , you know , photographed from the side .
if we made all of our autos this way , it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half sau@@ di arab@@ i@@ as , or half an op@@ e@@ c , by dri@@ ll@@ ing in the de@@ troit formation , a very pro@@ spe@@ ctive play .
bl@@ ess you . thank you very much .
it &apos;s a natural compon@@ ent for bringing people together , disc@@ us@@ sing ideas -- in the same way we &apos;re doing here at ted .
and she was getting a yo@@ gur@@ t in the google caf@@ e .
well , it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the compu@@ ta@@ tional universe .
are you serious about it , and not just , you know , when the consum@@ ers want it , when the regul@@ ators force us to do it we will go there ?
and then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the arm , this learned paraly@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body image and into your phan@@ tom , ok ?
so , they did their work with kit@@ tens , with different kinds of de@@ pri@@ vation regi@@ ments , and those studies , which date back to the &apos; 60s , are now being app@@ lied to human children .
so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in swi@@ tzer@@ land , den@@ mark and the u.@@ k .
or , you could say that the individual &apos;s pre@@ fer@@ ences were shaped by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of specific others .
they get a bad ra@@ p .
and in order to show you that the mal@@ ig@@ nant phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e i didn &apos;t just choose one , here are little movies , sort of fu@@ zz@@ y , but you see that on the left are the mal@@ ig@@ nant cells , all of them are mal@@ ig@@ nant , we add one single in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or in the beginning , and look what happens , they all look like that .
and the reason is that they &apos;re not able to communicate .
and i had a telephone call from robert lu@@ e at harvard , in the molecular and cell@@ ular biology department , a couple of years ago . he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard .
she needs to give it to us .
i had the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars from cla@@ es , and i put them there , and i could never get rid of them after that .
some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban bee@@ keeping terri@@ fic is in new york city , bee@@ keeping was illegal until 2010 .
it &apos;s really up to us .
you feel deep , deep guil@@ t .
it &apos;s out of print -- still ...
and you know what that means , of course .
hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine so i asked people whether they had basic audi@@ o cap@@ abilities , just so they could sing along to the song with head@@ phones on , so i could just get their voices back .
we did esti@@ mates in our study that for countries like brazi@@ l , india and in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , even though ecosystem services -- these benef@@ its that flow from nature to humanity for free -- they &apos;re not very big in per@@ cent@@ age terms of g@@ d@@ p -- two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent -- but in these countries , if we measure how much they &apos;re worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent .
here &apos;s a map a law@@ yer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
day zero : nothing happening .
and this is such an in@@ version , and such a wonderful example of children being the ag@@ ents of change .
at cor@@ e@@ ana super@@ market buying my k@@ im@@ ch@@ i because i like k@@ im@@ ch@@ i .
when their kids were five and two , c@@ aro@@ l had a stro@@ ke and a brain tumor and died suddenly .
and i &apos;m very well ... hung .
based on that we are announ@@ cing , here at ted , in true ted tradition , sing@@ ul@@ arity university .
there is no reason which does not take a position in the eth@@ ical sphere , in the philosop@@ hi@@ cal myster@@ y of what we are .
now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red . okay ?
but if you look at the blue data points , which is mechan@@ ically venti@@ l@@ ated air , it &apos;s not as di@@ verse .
there are a few key points .
more recently , finding ancient history .
in the 12@@ th century , hu@@ go of sant@@ all@@ a brought it from islam@@ ic my@@ stics into spa@@ in .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
there are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation .
these things were also important to me but not necessarily de@@ al-@@ break@@ ers .
this pic@@ to@@ graph by the jo@@ k@@ we people of ang@@ ola tells the story of the creation of the world .
and the har@@ dest part about that is probably the light , because it means you have to open up , you have to show your stuff to the world .
you &apos;ll have inter@@ n@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries for the rest of your life .
there was once a statement made by a psych@@ ologist that said that 80 percent of the pur@@ suit of happiness is really just about the genes , and it &apos;s as difficult to become happ@@ ier as it is to become t@@ aller .
i wish i had that when i was in college .
we &apos;re facing this problem .
he was a ma@@ ster mechan@@ ic , and he taught me how to use tools .
the co@@ p says , &quot; are you sure ? hey bud@@ dy , are you sure you lost your keys here ? &quot;
start all over again .
but if we place these technologies before student in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , we can be ro@@ b@@ bing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers : our students &apos; questions .
it actually goes way back , and what i want to suggest is it goes a long way back .
what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contribu@@ tors , instead of net pl@@ under@@ ers ?
and it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
and one of them is the l@@ ac@@ king buying power .
mom@@ a design cur@@ ator paola ant@@ on@@ elli pre@@ vie@@ ws the gro@@ und@@ breaking show &quot; &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; h@@ ttp : / / w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ mo@@ ma@@ .@@ or@@ g / exhibi@@ tions / 2008 / el@@ ast@@ ic@@ mind / &quot; &amp; gt ; design and the el@@ a@@ stic mind &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; &quot; -- full of products and designs that refle@@ ct the way we think now .
then i opened it up to creating art that was destro@@ yed natur@@ ally .
hans rosling : religi@@ ons and babies
and it &apos;s not a trip that requ@@ ir@@ es li@@ ght-@@ years of travel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defined by light .
every time i sort of pus@@ hed one down , another one would just sort of po@@ p back up again .
on janu@@ ary 2@@ 4@@ th , app@@ le computer will introduce ma@@ cin@@ to@@ sh .
so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibi@@ tion in china expla@@ ining the project .
but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneur@@ ship .
now , can someone own this idea ?
and what i did , i gave him just antibio@@ tics that we care for tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
i asked them what kind of building it was .
the first number is three : three billion people .
first , they &apos;re going to create an as@@ set regi@@ ster of sp@@ are land that they &apos;ve got , put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wher@@ ever they live , and they &apos;re going to under@@ p@@ in that with a licen@@ se .
once you do that , your arti@@ ll@@ ery becomes accurate .
they spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars mark@@ eting fo@@ ods that kids shouldn &apos;t eat for every one dollar mark@@ eting healthy , nutri@@ tious food .
but we need to be very clear about how little that means .
and not having to know history &apos;s next mad rage or re@@ gr@@ ession , it might be a re@@ lief .
it had occur@@ red on land , in rain@@ forests of south america and africa , where lan@@ dow@@ ners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
one stri@@ king recent case that we &apos;ve investig@@ ated is how the government in the democra@@ tic re@@ public of con@@ go sold off a series of valuable , stat@@ e-@@ ow@@ ned min@@ ing as@@ sets to sh@@ ell companies in the british virg@@ in is@@ lands .
we did it in 2004 , and we hope to assem@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
and she told all the other people , and she said , &quot; how could it possibly be that something that &apos;s cheap and simple works as well as something that &apos;s complicated and expensive ? &quot;
so they engine@@ ered these cells so that when they &apos;re growing in the exponenti@@ al phase , they would sm@@ ell like w@@ inter@@ green .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot@@ line .
and they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model .
but in 2002 , when my tour came to an end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london .
pollu@@ tion , global warming , these things -- the con@@ sequences are dist@@ ant in time and space .
it was about sha@@ do@@ ws .
and the part of the electric revolution that i want to focus on is sort of the gol@@ den age of appli@@ an@@ ces .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago , robert ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d used the pris@@ on@@ er &apos;s di@@ le@@ m@@ ma as a probe of the biological question : if we are here because our ance@@ stors were such fi@@ er@@ ce competi@@ tors , how does co@@ operation exist at all ?
it &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
because on earth , almost all -- 99@@ .@@ 9 percent -- of the me@@ than@@ e is produced by living systems , not little green men , but micro@@ scop@@ ic life below the surface or at the surface .
i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate al@@ chem@@ ist .
and right around that time , in the 19@@ 80 &apos;s , that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up , up , up , up , up , she wrote an edi@@ tori@@ al in the new england journ@@ al of medicine and said , the y@@ ent@@ l syn@@ dro@@ me .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure . &quot;
and yet , it is not taught in any k through 12 cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in america that i &apos;m aware of .
and this is one of those examples of the sets .
the united nations even has an agency which could bro@@ ker these comp@@ acts ; it &apos;s called the peace building com@@ mission .
in ab@@ sen@@ ce of the code , because , you know , video game companies are not very for@@ th@@ coming in some cases , in ab@@ sen@@ ce of that , we ac@@ qui@@ re the relationship with the company .
it &apos;s starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is d@@ ough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states , and a hand@@ ful of other developed countries , have shoul@@ dered the entire bur@@ den of research and development .
but ultimately you &apos;re going to civili@@ ani@@ ze it , probably two thir@@ ds .
and we can wra@@ p our heads around the sp@@ ills , because that &apos;s what we see here , but in fact , these guys actually live in a war zone .
i know i should men@@ tion : i &apos;m making all these things .
in fact , this lady has a particularly as@@ ym@@ metri@@ cal face , of which both si@@ des are beautiful .
if you want real evidence of out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ body experi@@ ences , by the way , get yourself along to a res@@ identi@@ al conference of sen@@ ior acade@@ mi@@ cs , and po@@ p into the disco@@ the@@ que on the final night .
someone who is , as the itali@@ ans say , &quot; ca@@ go@@ ots . &quot;
we can &apos;t be kill@@ ing camera men . we can &apos;t be kill@@ ing st@@ unt men .
and one of my big concern@@ s with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstra@@ ct .
it &apos;s the ultimate distribu@@ ted foot : its whole body in this case is acting like its foot .
they simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
the next is actually taking this feed@@ stock and putting in a tool , physi@@ cally fil@@ ling an en@@ clo@@ sure , a m@@ old , in whatever shape you want to get .
is this a good evolutionary adap@@ tation , or is it going to lead us to being the shor@@ te@@ st-@@ lived hom@@ in@@ id species on planet earth ?
we can see the same process@@ es at work in terms of the commer@@ ce bank -- its depen@@ dence on natural venti@@ lation , the way that you can model those gar@@ den@@ s , the way they spi@@ ral around .
somehow buying a local let@@ tu@@ ce , changing a light bul@@ b , driving the speed limit , changing your ti@@ res regul@@ arly , doesn &apos;t seem suff@@ ici@@ ent in the face of climate crisis .
sa@@ man@@ th@@ a power tells a story of a complicated hero , ser@@ gi@@ o vi@@ ei@@ ra de m@@ ell@@ o . this un diplom@@ at walked a thin moral line , negoti@@ ating with the world &apos;s worst di@@ ct@@ ators to help their people survive crisis . it &apos;s a comp@@ elling story told with a fi@@ ery passion .
now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worl@@ ds .
finally , make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as anno@@ ying and as pain@@ ful and as difficult as possible for them .
these are really simple , smart solutions based on exi@@ sting technology .
so , i probably have about two more years left on this project -- on this phase of the project , but after five years , i really feel like i know what &apos;s at the heart of this work .
an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can demon@@ strate that if poverty was the only factor , well bin laden is from one of the rich@@ est families in sau@@ di arab@@ ia .
it &apos;s an alternative form of heal@@ ing , right ?
so , i hope i can really ac@@ comp@@ lish that .
he &apos;s war@@ y , so he &apos;ll keep his eyes on me .
they &apos;re si@@ ck , and so they &apos;re less able to de@@ fend themselves from the mosquit@@ oes .
you can walk through . you can touch .
this is a shop@@ ping m@@ all .
so even though i didn &apos;t grow any t@@ aller , i didn &apos;t spr@@ out a be@@ ard , something had changed : my inter@@ ior di@@ alo@@ gue had changed .
we want to go and work in a dog shel@@ ter .
and we build the project to the end .
remember that i men@@ tioned before the children who lose their finger@@ tips .
and some doctors think , &quot; yeah right , you &apos;re really in pain . &quot;
what &apos;s your view on that ?
our worst fe@@ ars might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening .
she had to im@@ person@@ ate a man .
it isn &apos;t just about nice .
it &apos;s hot@@ ter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more , right , because of the ti@@ lt of the earth .
to show you how schizop@@ hren@@ ic this all is , here &apos;s the head of my@@ space , or fo@@ x interactive , a news cor@@ p company , being asked , well , with the writers &apos; stri@@ ke , isn &apos;t this going to hurt news cor@@ p and help you online ?
but also , there seems to be a complete sort of gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck in terms of solving these small solutions .
that &apos;s the idea .
well , let &apos;s hold on to that thought for just a minute .
so , you give people lots and lots of different tas@@ ks .
well i was born in the most difficult time , when my country was at war .
so the data that i have sugge@@ sts that if you double ex@@ port volu@@ me , it will lead to a quad@@ ru@@ pling of new hiv infe@@ ctions .
it &apos;s this am@@ phi@@ theater right over 10@@ th a@@ ve .
and to connect our country after world war i@@ i , we didn &apos;t build more two-@@ lan@@ e high@@ ways , we built the inter@@ state highway system .
and all forms of inter@@ vention need support , the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth , the kinds of institutions that increase produ@@ ctivity .
in fact , the data doesn &apos;t make any sense .
now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sphere .
it &apos;s pretty clean . if you &apos;re healthy , you &apos;re pretty healthy .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
the familiar one on the lower right .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappe@@ ar . &quot;
because liber@@ als re@@ je@@ ct three of these founda@@ tions .
i grew up like this , and so did my other three si@@ sters .
&quot; i told david , &apos; keep your work out of my kitchen . &apos; but i was wrong . &quot;
even more proble@@ matic , they &apos;re not listening to poor people themselves .
life needs a mem@@ bran@@ e to con@@ tain itself so it can replic@@ ate and mu@@ tate .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , mr. ze frank .
e@@ j : finally , let &apos;s see what this looks like .
and it turns out i &apos;ve got the de@@ vil inside of me .
the tube there &apos;s hol@@ low , about pa@@ per@@ -@@ thin .
there is no society ever discovered in the re@@ mot@@ est corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts .
it &apos;s about getting a space@@ craft that &apos;s hur@@ tling through deep space and using all this ba@@ g of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour .
might we answer that cl@@ ari@@ on call with science , with reason , with facts , and , d@@ are i say it , emotions ?
prof@@ its made , prophe@@ ts ignor@@ ed .
this is the exhi@@ b@@ ited art on the walls of the ci@@ a in lang@@ ley , virginia , their original head@@ quar@@ ters building .
i never was p@@ ure .
google &apos;s &quot; j@@ olly good fellow , &quot; cha@@ de-@@ men@@ g tan , talks about how the company practic@@ es compassion in its everyday business -- and its b@@ old side projects .
what i wanted to do was give the dol@@ ph@@ ins choice and control .
it &apos;s in manhattan . you &apos;re in central park -- it &apos;s kind of ir@@ relevant -- but the c@@ able looks one-@@ dimensional from a dist@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and i all know that it does have some th@@ i@@ ck@@ ness .
well nonetheless , on the top of the world trade center my first step was terri@@ fying .
&quot; really , &quot; for an animal , is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to as@@ s@@ ist its survival , and because different species live in different worl@@ ds , there will be a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ting variety of &quot; really &quot; s .
the doctors who are not fighting , the artists , the students , the men who re@@ fu@@ se to pick up the g@@ uns , they are , too , ex@@ clu@@ ded from the negoti@@ ating tab@@ les .
nothing really interesting , basically .
there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
so it was taken for granted that i at@@ tend some of the best universities , which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity .
now , did he look for the most popular brand variety of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce ? no !
there &apos;s also ne@@ o-@@ biological design , where more and more we &apos;re actually using life itself and the process@@ es of life to become part of our industry .
this is the tate modern in london .
i &apos;m actually more critical of the men who won &apos;t take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to ear@@ n enough money to support those children .
dou@@ g &apos;s story takes place in a hospital .
stem cell@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved retin@@ al transplan@@ ts , now in a research phase , may one day restore vision , or part vision , to millions of patients with retin@@ al diseases worldwide .
but well , i &apos;m feeling good right now .
they p@@ at one another on the back ; they s@@ wa@@ g@@ ger ; they shake their f@@ ist -- the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context .
and the answer is , perhaps , that you use these guys , bac@@ ill@@ us pa@@ steu@@ ri@@ i , a micro@@ -@@ organis@@ m that is re@@ adi@@ ly available in wet@@ lands and marsh@@ es , and does precisely that .
i had my own &quot; lost time &quot; moment , where i wo@@ ke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day , almost din@@ ner@@ time , and she had not come back .
in fact , sol@@ z@@ hen@@ it@@ sy@@ n once said , &quot; to have a great writer is to have another government . &quot;
form and content are together here .
and go from this concept of walking , brea@@ thing , and then his hands , speak , and ultimately happiness and function .
this is the equivalent to the entire american cor@@ n cro@@ p fail@@ ing along with all of our fru@@ it cro@@ ps , as well as whe@@ at , to@@ bac@@ co , rice , sor@@ gh@@ um -- whatever sor@@ gh@@ um is -- losing sor@@ gh@@ um .
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that sl@@ ing@@ ers were the decisi@@ ve factor against in@@ fan@@ try in one kind of battle or another .
to temp@@ t us to act differently with deli@@ ght@@ ful creative sc@@ ra@@ ps .
and we saw that , where you have all the computers of the world .
thank you .
what i am saying though is that human beings are not one-@@ dimensional .
we can &apos;t predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual col@@ li@@ sion .
so , again , this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on .
and the objects which were used as examples , when i was a child and a student , as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -- those objects , i turned them completely around .
and of course , i wanted to know whether i was doing that .
another said it was &quot; liber@@ ty and freedom and being open-@@ minded with each other . &quot;
satis@@ fied ?
it may not be pus@@ hing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy by teaching in environ@@ ments like that day after day .
we went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent by the early post@@ war years .
that &apos;s basically all we &apos;re going to be talking about here .
given ra@@ w facts or data to actually answer questions , one has to compu@@ te : one has to imple@@ ment all those metho@@ ds and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries .
and yet black hol@@ es may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they ban@@ g on spac@@ e-@@ time like a drum .
&quot; tra@@ vels the world . &quot;
the partici@@ pan@@ ts at impro@@ v everywhere events have just as much lei@@ sure time as any other new yor@@ kers , they just occasi@@ on@@ ally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
but nothing , nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of ju@@ ly 2008 .
i like to think of it as a mes@@ h of civili@@ zations , in which the strands of different cultures are inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed .
and because , quite ri@@ ghtly , they were saying psych@@ ology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you . spo@@ t the lo@@ ony .
al@@ is@@ a &apos;s the president of public radio international .
you &apos;re at a particular road jun@@ ction .
i had the vegetable car@@ vers work on that for me .
and this started an incredible collabor@@ ation with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vac@@ cine that tar@@ ge@@ ted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
this is me in the middle making faces .
and if we find that thing , maybe there is a big f@@ at no@@ bel prize out there .
the three of us go to the ex@@ am together , and we sit down .
especially if you &apos;re me , &apos; cause al@@ z@@ hei@@ mer &apos;s ten@@ ds to run in families .
for instance , there &apos;s e@@ bird , where ama@@ te@@ ur bir@@ d@@ wat@@ chers can u@@ plo@@ ad information about their bird si@@ ght@@ ings .
right now the de@@ fau@@ lt position about when a new technology comes along , is we -- people talk about the prec@@ au@@ tion@@ ary principle , which is very common in europe , which says , basically , &quot; don &apos;t do anything . when you meet a new technology , stop , until it can be pro@@ ven that there &apos;s no har@@ m . &quot;
i was walking . i heard &quot; be@@ ep , be@@ ep . &quot;
it &apos;s that will to live , that need to survive , to express itself , that comes in a car , and takes over people like me .
giving your life away .
you haven &apos;t pat@@ ented this stuff . it &apos;s really interesting to me .
ultimately , we now live in a world defined not by consumption , but by particip@@ ation .
it never re@@ a@@ ches the ground where it was meant for .
look what it takes to make things like ipo@@ ds .
they wrote books and artic@@ les pro@@ mot@@ ing indu@@ ctive method in all the sci@@ ences that were wid@@ ely read by natural philosop@@ her@@ s , university students and members of the public .
and i said , &quot; dr. heal@@ ey , if my dau@@ gh@@ ters come to you one day and say , &apos; what should i learn from my da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s story ? &apos; what would you tell them ? &quot;
so you have to be open to having your data shared , which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page , or your computer .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innova@@ tions today .
art can change the way we see the world .
that is how , for example , four ger@@ man states in 2010 were 4@@ 3 to 5@@ 2 percent wind powered .
he had to tour around europe to support his family -- wol@@ f@@ gang ama@@ de@@ us mo@@ z@@ art -- but that was centuries ago , so we can make him an exception .
and , finally , compare no@@ des c and d : c and d both have six friends .
so i now would like you to &#91; put &#93; your seat bel@@ ts on and put your hat@@ s &#91; on &#93; .
it &apos;s a research plat@@ form .
but it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pull itself up .
&quot; going on &quot; is perhaps a little bit strong .
true ali@@ ens , sto@@ cks that arri@@ ved from ou@@ ter space .
ren@@ dering auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity -- and the ke@@ y@@ word is &quot; ren@@ dering . &quot;
thank you very much .
in the mean@@ time , we had to cover n@@ ollywood , and we talked to a lot of film@@ ma@@ kers .
i think it &apos;s quite significant . this is where they go .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well .
now , we &apos;ve seen a lot of examples of people who are pur@@ su@@ ing that sort of vision in science , but i think it &apos;s also true in the arts , it &apos;s true in politics , it &apos;s even true in personal en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s .
what do they bring ? they bring this fabul@@ ous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
all right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an ir@@ ani@@ an woman and an ir@@ ani@@ an artist , even if i have to oper@@ ate in the west only for now .
so i &apos;m not im@@ mun@@ e to this .
c@@ p : at first , very kind of pa@@ ined , aw@@ k@@ ward conver@@ sations .
she couldn &apos;t sing much , couldn &apos;t play anymore .
we constantly have to kind of di@@ al them back .
the spi@@ kes on the back of the sty@@ gi@@ m@@ olo@@ ch are actually res@@ or@@ bing , which means they &apos;re getting smaller as that dom@@ e is getting bigger .
you know something ? this has been achiev@@ ed in india .
for the ki@@ dney , as i talked to you about the first pain@@ ting that you saw , the first slide i showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a ki@@ dney , 90 percent .
there is so much organic social action all around google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these eff@@ or@@ ts .
imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve rais@@ ed -- maybe you &apos;re a politi@@ cian in a developing country and you have a budget to spend . you want to spend it on the poor : how do you go about it ?
i still have to help them a lot .
surpris@@ ingly , origami and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami turn out to have appli@@ cations in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consu@@ mer electron@@ ics and more .
it &apos;s important because mis@@ reading is really the chance for comp@@ lication and opportunity .
and then when i would run out of that story , i would imagine that wo@@ od@@ cu@@ tter &apos;s universe is one atom in the a@@ x of another wo@@ od@@ cu@@ tter .
i think i have it .
co@@ ws are invisible . co@@ ws are boring .
and we &apos;ve ren@@ dered something il@@ le@@ gi@@ ble , and we &apos;ve lost the sense of what &apos;s actually happening in this world that we &apos;ve made .
we extended this idea . we tested it many times over , and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trick@@ le charge on solar energy , but most importantly connect to a car battery , because a car battery is a ubi@@ quit@@ ous source of power in places where there &apos;s not enough electricity or er@@ ra@@ tic electricity .
and it turns out that , in fact , technologies don &apos;t die .
so imagine you &apos;re inside the big ban@@ g .
so even though bas@@ king sharks are found throughout the world , you couldn &apos;t tell the difference gene@@ tically from one from the pac@@ i@@ fic , the atlantic , new ze@@ al@@ and , or from ireland , south africa .
this is a real ad .
but we got up there , and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been di@@ ved and just get to an island and go , &quot; okay , where are we going to di@@ ve ?
ma@@ tt rid@@ ley : thank you , cy@@ n@@ thia .
so , i think science can be -- seren@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important .
i &apos;m going to show you what it &apos;s like to do one of these di@@ ves that we do .
there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism . in fact , we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism , and genetic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , much more than just genes .
i hope nobody fin@@ ds that offen@@ sive .
there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bac@@ teri@@ al cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .
kt : that is weird .
so they have ad@@ ju@@ sted the 2012 olymp@@ ic budget for the optimis@@ m bias .
we carry in our face the proof that co@@ o@@ king , food transformation , made us what we are .
tomorrow , paola ant@@ on@@ elli is speaking . i love paola .
i had no jo@@ ke for that .
on this side was men , and then the bar@@ ri@@ er , and this side was women .
natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted , and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don &apos;t get what we wanted .
this was published after he died : his sort of un@@ finished not@@ es on self-@@ re@@ producing machines , what it takes to get the machines sort of jump@@ -@@ started to where they begin to re@@ produce .
so anything that influ@@ ences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
and then , ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing all our ge@@ ar , we were for@@ ced to ri@@ de out in the middle of the night , in a quite dra@@ matic scene .
thank you .
we &apos;re like every big city in the world .
even when the japanese bom@@ bed pe@@ ar@@ l h@@ arb@@ or , at least they shot back .
this was bad .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
to inten@@ tionally har@@ m people psych@@ ologi@@ cally , to hurt people physi@@ cally , to destroy people mor@@ t@@ ally , or ideas , and to com@@ mit cri@@ mes against humanity .
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back .
but you don &apos;t want to have to res@@ et the whole machine because the le@@ go car at the end doesn &apos;t work , right .
bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
well , it &apos;s not@@ ori@@ ously difficult to get people to be far@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
an ir@@ a dri@@ ver was shot , and his car plo@@ wed into people on the side of the street .
this is a picture that al g@@ ore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the so@@ vi@@ et union a long , long time ago , showing the fishing fle@@ ets of the ar@@ al sea .
this has rough@@ ly 6@@ 0,000 elements on it , so we repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly measure various genes of the 25@@ ,000 genes in the genome .
now this situation , already i -- you know , i don &apos;t really like thinking about this , although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it . so the point is that we &apos;re very , very inse@@ cure in terms of developing this material .
&quot; run like the wind , ver@@ u@@ ca ! run ! &quot;
now , he gets to f-@@ shar@@ p , and finally he goes down to e , but it &apos;s the wrong ch@@ ord -- because the ch@@ ord he &apos;s looking for is this one , and instead he does ...
so we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . we figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
we are a country of vi@@ cti@@ ms .
it was a kind of un@@ inten@@ ded positive feedback loo@@ p between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move , that engineers knew nothing about .
but more importantly , it was lin@@ ked in to the an@@ de@@ an no@@ tions of sa@@ cre@@ d ge@@ ograph@@ y .
places that are not markets , see@@ ding it with the principles of sat@@ u@@ ration , conne@@ ctivity , low ages , etc .
and then in 2000 , the map satellite was launched -- the w@@ map -- and it made somewhat better pictures .
so to the tun@@ isi@@ an intelligence agency , and organi@@ zations like it all over the arab world , j@@ i@@ had equ@@ aled extre@@ mis@@ m , bin laden &apos;s definition had become institution@@ alized .
and now it &apos;s just limited to a couple of spo@@ ts in ne@@ p@@ al and india .
and we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
it has to be able to come off of the cen@@ ter@@ line and then be able to work back toward that cen@@ ter@@ line .
the ima@@ gery of god is absolute being , absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love .
and the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important , because when new cells are formed , these strands come apart , new strands are synthesi@@ zed with the old ones as tem@@ plates in an almost perfect process .
but i should really talk stage five , right ? &quot; life is great . &quot;
one can do it as a tech person , or as a finance person , or a non@@ profit person , or as an enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment person , but every one of us is all of those things and more .
so , i would suggest that we don &apos;t think intelligence , we think replic@@ ators .
i ran away .
tomorrow , i am going to ca@@ ir@@ o , and i &apos;m so moved that i will be with women in ca@@ ir@@ o who are v-day women , who are opening the first safe house for batter@@ ed women in the middle east .
could we have people singing together in real time ?
w@@ f@@ p &apos;s been able to leave 30 nations because they have trans@@ formed the face of hunger in their nations .
so t is f .
so that brings us to the first problem that i &apos;ll raise this morning , which is how do we stop a de@@ ad@@ ly disease that &apos;s spread by mosquit@@ os ?
no re@@ fu@@ eling means you can se@@ al them up and they &apos;re not going to be a pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation risk , and they &apos;re not going to have either nuclear material or radi@@ ological material pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ated from their cor@@ es .
and it is a process that can be energi@@ zed and nur@@ tured .
a ger@@ man pris@@ on camp .
so let &apos;s start by making autos oil free .
and from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of regi@@ stration , not only of still images , but also of video .
moder@@ ator : ai@@ me@@ e and the designer of them will be at ted@@ med 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
to me , this is not an information age , it &apos;s an age of net@@ worked intelligence .
contemporary art , i later discovered , isn &apos;t explained by a l@@ ame story like mine .
so richard sau@@ l wur@@ man has about a 15 percent google share of the ted conference .
so for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , mi@@ ch@@ al , a few of my friends , are just making images .
the last ice age started rough@@ ly 1@@ 20,000 years ago .
and they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we &apos;re going to -- how we &apos;re going to continu@@ ally prove that the planet is getting war@@ mer , when that &apos;s actually contr@@ ary to most people &apos;s sen@@ sations .
it &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
or is it a kind of seren@@ di@@ p@@ ity that we cannot explain , like the co@@ sm@@ ological const@@ ant ?
i should say that how far advan@@ ced a notice one might get about something depen@@ ds on a ho@@ st of fac@@ tors .
now , i &apos;m going to show you the beginn@@ ings of a piece that is about balance in some ways , and also -- oh , actually , if you &apos;re bor@@ ed , not here , here &apos;s one use for it .
f@@ las@@ h@@ -@@ forward to the next year and &quot; the book of awesome &quot; has now been number one on the best@@ s@@ eller list for 20 straight weeks .
he needed to be a very sym@@ pa@@ thetic character .
giant , al@@ mon@@ d-@@ shaped , un@@ blin@@ king eyes ?
okay , india .
so a pretty big en@@ dea@@ vor , and we worked on the dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers .
this says : &quot; one clean f@@ its all . &quot; .
if we look at the re@@ turns to labor , in other words total wa@@ ges paid out in the economy , we see them at an all@@ -@@ time low and head@@ ing very quickly in the op@@ posite direction .
in northern california , we &apos;re beginning to take ob@@ serva@@ tions with the first 4@@ 2 telescop@@ es of the allen telescope ar@@ ray -- and i &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publi@@ c@@ ly thank paul allen and na@@ than my@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and all the team@@ se@@ ti members in the ted community who have so gener@@ ously supported this research .
and i think , &quot; i &apos;m sitting next to lewis pu@@ gh . &quot;
this reaction exp@@ ands into adul@@ tho@@ od and becomes sort of a ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn dis@@ gu@@ st response , no longer just about whether or not we &apos;re about to be po@@ is@@ oned , but whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical cont@@ am@@ ination from some source . but the face rema@@ ins stri@@ k@@ ingly similar .
it &apos;s a great challenge for them .
didn &apos;t have to worry about ear@@ ning money .
it &apos;s a big deal . it sounds big , it sounds important , it sounds soli@@ d . it sounds american . ball@@ sy , serious , male .
bill gates : how state budgets are breaking us schools
so think , this is a serious question .
this is a little us@@ b key .
if you think about the last time , i dun@@ no , you had a wo@@ b@@ bly to@@ oth .
is this change , though , a real change , or is it a fig@@ ment of the imagination of the patient themselves ?
the first thing that you need to do when you have an un@@ deci@@ pher@@ ed scri@@ pt is try to figure out the direction of writing .
but today , women are re@@ building r@@ wand@@ a .
and there &apos;s also a balance between the visible and the invisible in com@@ ics .
it was for funding from the government for us@@ er-@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed design for energ@@ y-@@ efficient buildings , difficult to say , and something i had no idea what it was when i went into the work@@ shop , but quickly learned .
this is not local population , this is re@@ b@@ els .
malaria is one of the great public health problems .
especially here in washington , if you try to make a break@@ fast date , and you say , &quot; how about eight o &apos;@@ clock ? &quot;
and they say &quot; it &apos;s 18 minutes . &quot;
we saw scientific revolu@@ tions , the prote@@ stant re@@ formation , const@@ itu@@ tional democra@@ cies possible where they had not been possible before .
that 14@@ -year-old kid would say : &quot; oh , well ... &quot;
the best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspe@@ cts of life that we need to embra@@ ce in order for our own crea@@ tivity to fl@@ our@@ ish .
this one says , &quot; bu@@ co@@ lic me@@ a@@ do@@ w with spli@@ t-@@ ra@@ il f@@ ence .
it &apos;s predi@@ ct@@ able .
keep shoot &apos; n . keep shoot &apos; n .
so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can hand@@ le sort of sounds a little re@@ tr@@ o , but i think it still has its place .
so we know that in pri@@ mate hierarch@@ ies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one has gone up significantly and his cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l has dro@@ pped significantly .
i like the physical book .
it &apos;s much easier to use , much less pain@@ ful .
okay . so ...
and i conclu@@ ded , after resear@@ ching every other technology that we could de@@ plo@@ y for stor@@ ing energy -- fl@@ y@@ whe@@ els , different for@@ mu@@ lations of batter@@ ies -- it just wasn &apos;t prac@@ tical to store energy .
audience : a@@ y@@ e .
although women do two-@@ thir@@ ds of the world &apos;s labor , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s as@@ sets .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the flu@@ p@@ sy par@@ ade and che@@ er on the o@@ y@@ ster sp@@ ats as they go down to the re@@ e@@ f .
we &apos;ve got 3@@ 3 camer@@ as out this moment .
and imagine cop@@ ying that by hand .
also , another sense which com@@ ics &apos; vision repres@@ ents , and that &apos;s time .
&quot; british jobs for scot@@ tish people ...
i talked to a boar@@ ding school up in new england , probably the most pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous boar@@ ding school , and they said , &quot; we already know that .
the ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening .
this image , for example , is sort of spo@@ t-@@ on because it exactly sums up what el@@ ton may be doing in private , and also what might be happening with sa@@ d@@ da@@ m hus@@ sein , and george bush reading the koran up@@ si@@ de-@@ down .
although five is a good number , of course .
to recei@@ ve a prize from the university , and three days later , a pil@@ ot was flying over the landscape and found this thing .
the hid@@ den dan@@ ger is he@@ ter@@ oc@@ y@@ cli@@ c am@@ ines -- specifically phen@@ ome@@ th@@ y@@ li@@ mi@@ da@@ zop@@ y@@ rid@@ ine , or phi@@ p -- which is the im@@ mun@@ ogen@@ ic or car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic com@@ po@@ und .
and so now let me suggest two comp@@ li@@ ment@@ ary appro@@ a@@ ches to changing the reality of the situations .
paul mac@@ cre@@ ad@@ y : a flight on solar wings
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent .
the world is much better equi@@ pped to over@@ come an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what i &apos;m talking about .
and i believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face , it is to per@@ su@@ ade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are fo@@ unded on these rules .
they listen and mi@@ mic and re@@ mix what they like .
an ny@@ u resear@@ cher here took little car@@ d@@ board robots with s@@ mi@@ ley faces on them , and a motor that just dro@@ ve them forward and a fla@@ g sti@@ cking out the back with a des@@ i@@ red dest@@ ination .
so we began this journey , and we launched it in 199@@ 9 .
okay . now we &apos;re going north , very far north .
but that bl@@ ack@@ out risk disappe@@ ars , and all of the other ris@@ ks are best managed , with distribu@@ ted ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables organi@@ zed into local micro@@ -@@ gri@@ ds that normally inter@@ connect , but can stand alone at need .
this is a huge problem and a huge ob@@ stac@@ le to change because it means that some of the most passionate and in@@ formed voices are completely si@@ len@@ ced , especially during election time .
not many people check boxes .
all right , why would we see this cor@@ relation ?
they would have to film us from a really long distance by he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter and then have a really long lens , and we would see ourselves , on tv , pa@@ sting .
they had found a problem .
cli@@ ff@@ ord stol@@ l : the call to learn
the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information .
you can see the cop@@ per tips on these things .
humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because , by and large , we really don &apos;t have to ada@@ pt to our environment ; we ada@@ pt our environment to us .
and i think we make a fundamental mista@@ ke -- we make an assu@@ mption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
and since then i &apos;ve followed the un@@ folding issue of wor@@ ker rights .
and their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genoci@@ de and put our tro@@ op@@ s in har@@ m &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and plu@@ ck genoci@@ da@@ ir@@ es from cam@@ ps .
we can de@@ fle@@ ct both of these asteroi@@ ds .
so all of a sudden we had two problems .
fungi don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibio@@ tics come from fungi .
not just for y@@ ourselves , but for your generation and generations to come .
they organi@@ ze their whole life around this .
that &apos;s basically how this thing oper@@ ates .
so what do artists do ? well , what artists do is to measure .
y@@ ang lan : the generation that &apos;s re@@ making china
so if you cross the bor@@ der -- just across the bor@@ der -- a small fac@@ tory in ger@@ many , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communic@@ ated .
let &apos;s do something really simple .
it could destroy the ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca del@@ ta , the largest and possibly greatest fres@@ h@@ water del@@ ta in the planet .
and i &apos;m going to go through some of them .
and i use this little image to say this is what happens to mo@@ s@@ ses .
so kal@@ u@@ za said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more prec@@ ise .
and that was such an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening , trans@@ forma@@ tive moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact i &apos;d ever had on anyone &apos;s life , a moment that had a woman walk up to a stran@@ ger four years later and say , &quot; you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , &quot; was a moment that i didn &apos;t even remember .
she looks at me like i &apos;m her , you know , her mor@@ on child , the cre@@ tin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and dist@@ in@@ ctly .
but they have qu@@ alities we &apos;d all recognize .
everybody has the wrong idea . they think buddha was so boring , and they &apos;re so surprised when they meet d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a and he &apos;s fair@@ ly j@@ olly .
and think of the laptop as a vac@@ cine .
the hi@@ pp@@ o ju@@ g@@ ger@@ n@@ aut we have created , if un@@ ab@@ ated , is dest@@ ined -- according to the best esti@@ mates of on@@ going bio@@ diversity research -- to reduce half of earth &apos;s still survi@@ ving animal and plant species to extin@@ ction or critical en@@ danger@@ ment by the end of the century .
and again , we had to fly to the jo@@ vian system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
and the interesting thing that happens -- because we &apos;re using ta@@ d@@ po@@ les , of course , because they have the most ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te bio@@ senses that we have , several or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tude more sensi@@ tive than some of our senses for sen@@ sing , respon@@ ding in a biologi@@ cally meaningful way , to that whole class of industrial cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants we call en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine dis@@ rup@@ tors or hor@@ m@@ one e@@ mul@@ ators .
this , de@@ ar friends , poses a human pressure on the planet of mom@@ ent@@ ous scale .
if you want to talk to me about ad@@ h@@ d afterwards , you can talk to me then . all right -- by the way , one last instru@@ ction , for my ju@@ d@@ ges with the cal@@ cul@@ ators -- ok , you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that i will make a mista@@ ke here .
we don &apos;t have to choose between inspired emplo@@ ye@@ es and si@@ z@@ able prof@@ its , we can have both .
and even better , because it &apos;s an interactive app@@ lication , you can tell the story for yourself .
and when they find them they pull them out and they p@@ in them to the wall like bu@@ tter@@ flies .
of course , because of the free licen@@ sing , if i do a bad job , the volunte@@ ers are more than happy to take and leave -- i can &apos;t tell anyone what to do .
and so they &apos;re valuable . this is preci@@ ous met@@ als and gem@@ st@@ ones .
and the she@@ pher@@ d dra@@ ws closer and closer , and the giant sees that he &apos;s car@@ r@@ ying a st@@ af@@ f .
all i wanted to do was put my running sho@@ es on and run out the door .
there &apos;s nothing i can do as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
bill gates hop@@ es to solve some of the world &apos;s biggest problems using a new kind of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y . in a passionate and , yes , funny 18 minutes , he as@@ ks us to consider two big questions and how we might answer them .
through evolution and sele@@ ction , we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathema@@ tically se@@ mi@@ -@@ liter@@ ate .
yes . exactly .
and the rest of you , you still count , you still matter .
you express yourself because you have compassion .
we &apos;ve also made partner@@ shi@@ ps with artists , with people who understand and can communicate the aes@@ thetic beauty of trees and forest can@@ op@@ ies .
somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by she@@ aring win@@ ds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer diff@@ er significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this und@@ ul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those spe@@ eds is just right , the top@@ s of the un@@ du@@ lations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like vor@@ tic@@ es .
thank you .
so bio@@ sphere 2 was essentially a three-@@ ac@@ re , enti@@ rely se@@ aled , mini@@ ature world that i lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
ki@@ wis are , and so are these ha@@ w@@ ks tra@@ pped near antar@@ c@@ tica .
it &apos;s a large effort . it &apos;s all at nasa lang@@ ley research center .
so , how do i explain this myster@@ ious aff@@ in@@ ity ?
and you wonder , if this is a museum , what it &apos;s going to be like inside ?
i was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good inten@@ tions .
but that &apos;s just the easy part , or ought to be .
if it &apos;s population , we &apos;re on course to top the char@@ ts .
and to be honest , if i had known when i was asked to give this up@@ beat talk that even as i was giving the up@@ beat talk , the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se would be un@@ folding -- -- i might have said , &quot; is it okay if i talk about something else ? &quot;
so exploration can pay for itself .
this isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
then there was no looking back at all for us .
i thought it was fit@@ ting for me to be doing that .
so imagine yourself .
the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , &quot; our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospit@@ als and nur@@ sing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot;
so i basically rough@@ ed out what ht@@ m@@ l should look like : hyper@@ text proto@@ co@@ l , h@@ ttp ; the idea of ur@@ ls , these names for things which started with h@@ ttp .
this is the work of k@@ ac@@ ey mar@@ ra from pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world .
and i ran the story and i said , &quot; what do you think ? &quot;
thank you very much .
after 198@@ 5 , and before the break up of the so@@ vi@@ et union , we began to dis@@ arm from a nuclear point of view .
this is a pres@@ cri@@ ption to improve water quality .
a@@ o : fantastic . well done , der@@ ek .
the seeds are then plan@@ ted , then gro@@ wn .
n in the process of my research , i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone resear@@ ching this .
why has it ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated lat@@ ely ?
so we &apos;ll have to use our computers to try to uns@@ cra@@ m@@ ble the chain .
they dance , they act -- and the more they do , they are pra@@ is@@ ed .
in response , three tri@@ bes led by the la@@ k@@ ota ch@@ ie@@ f red cloud attac@@ ked and de@@ fe@@ ated the u.s. ar@@ my many times over .
it &apos;s as though mexico and canada were ho@@ sti@@ le neighbors to the united states , which they &apos;re not .
find me when you can . &quot;
this is not unusual , and it &apos;s part of what en@@ ables people to main@@ tain these kinds of changes , because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life .
instead , the human spirit radi@@ ated out from the met@@ al walls and g@@ arb@@ age he@@ aps to offer something no legal neigh@@ bor@@ hood could : freedom .
you can feel your body .
and typically , you would take data , like the data of a pen here , which would be a ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric represent@@ ation of that product in 3d , and we would pass that data with material into a machine .
i &apos;m actually going to give you an example of how we do so .
and we can see them divi@@ ding throughout .
we have to recognize that human fl@@ our@@ ishing is not a mechan@@ ical process ; it &apos;s an organic process .
they do a lot of the similar things .
people are gla@@ dly willing to wait : as long as they &apos;re waiting 12 , they might as well wait 13 .
it &apos;s like a project on which they &apos;re constantly ad@@ ding up@@ gra@@ des and impro@@ v@@ ements and corre@@ ctions .
those of you who have seen the film &quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball , &quot; or have read the book by michael lewis , will be familiar with the story of bil@@ ly be@@ an@@ e .
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
notice both hal@@ ves of that explanation .
the first dra@@ w@@ back is that it turns out the pleas@@ ant life , your experience of positive emotion , is her@@ itable , about 50 percent her@@ itable , and , in fact , not very modi@@ fi@@ able .
i think he &apos;s one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in afghanistan , in iraq .
he would come into fail@@ ing businesses and close down 30 percent of the work@@ force , just turn american to@@ w@@ ns into g@@ ho@@ st to@@ w@@ ns .
it &apos;s still going on .
by dete@@ cting the od@@ or of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analy@@ ze the results .
however , these two countries have the identical g@@ in@@ i co@@ efficient , which is a measure of income equality .
god knows it took a huge amount of technical sk@@ ill .
i like them young , male , un@@ mar@@ ried , slightly p@@ is@@ sed off .
but on the other side of that pre@@ dat@@ ory ga@@ ze is a female hus@@ ky in a play bo@@ w , wa@@ g@@ ging her tail .
a cl@@ am@@ sh@@ ell &apos;s hard .
another half an hour and we would have won . &quot;
and i knew she wouldn &apos;t want me to go get them , so i just did it anyway .
but they wrote a paper about this , and everybody in the western world began using electricity to con@@ vul@@ se people who were either schizop@@ hren@@ ic or sever@@ ely depres@@ sed .
jo@@ kes , no copy@@ right protection .
mach@@ u pic@@ ch@@ u was never a lost city .
so we calculate the percent redu@@ ction per year , but it &apos;s sort of the same per@@ cent@@ age .
bar@@ ry schwar@@ tz : our loss of wisdom
the earth always did have limits .
can we see that ? em : yeah .
the pakistan@@ i bat@@ s@@ man trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here i was , out@@ war@@ dly very successful , but in@@ war@@ dly very depres@@ sed .
the picture behind me was sna@@ pped by the cop@@ il@@ ot in our ch@@ ase air@@ craft just moments after the whe@@ els got off the ground for the first time .
and so these days i try to learn from my grand@@ father &apos;s example in my own way .
so this is a typical men@@ u .
almost all patients are in@@ cur@@ able . &quot;
em : with a friend who will re@@ main nam@@ eless .
and the first story is called &quot; the fau@@ l@@ ty switch . &quot;
so babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cultu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers that we are .
and i take the united states -- we still want to see the background -- i put them up like this , and now we go back@@ wards .
i negoti@@ ated for my country the resol@@ ution in the security coun@@ cil of the 12@@ th of september 2001 con@@ dem@@ ning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .
too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that &apos;s so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago i thought that the most un@@ boring place in the world would be like a t@@ .@@ v@@ . studio , like for a day show . some kind of day talk show .
so it turns out that google is a com@@ passionate company , because googl@@ ers found compassion to be fun .
he had the quali@@ fi@@ cations . not the only one , but he was one that i used in that particular categ@@ ory , because i think he made the effort to become the best &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
then they present all of the stuff that they &apos;ve developed to their team@@ mates , to the rest of the company , in this wild and wo@@ ol@@ y all@@ -@@ hands meeting at the end of the day .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
now , in my lab at stanford , we &apos;ve been working on autonom@@ ous cars too , but with a slightly different spin on things . you see , we &apos;ve been developing robotic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance .
perhaps the universe exi@@ sted before the ban@@ g , and the ban@@ g was just a violent event in a pre@@ -@@ exi@@ sting universe .
this is an easy sell .
it &apos;s just , you know , it was just so interesting , just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there .
we &apos;re all going to eventually , even in the developed world , going to have to lose everything that we love .
i paid about one million dollars for that machine .
the b@@ hu@@ tan@@ ese aren &apos;t on some as@@ pi@@ rational tre@@ ad@@ mil@@ l , constantly focused on what they don &apos;t have .
they don &apos;t feel the push from the ground , is the truth .
thanks .
well , what does this really look like ?
but we won &apos;t be able to take care of any of those things if we don &apos;t solve the real problem we have in mexico first .
you say that you were born in par@@ ad@@ ise .
what happens is , if something ma@@ gi@@ cal happens , if something natural happens to you , you &apos;re able to produce all this beautiful stuff inst@@ antly , and then that &apos;s what i consider &quot; flow , &quot; because that &apos;s when everything cli@@ cks and you &apos;re able to do anything .
never forget -- like that , like that .
so , si@@ ber@@ ia , man@@ ch@@ uri@@ a .
so you could wait and go through con@@ gress , although you should be very im@@ patient .
education : six , seven , eight percent of the economy and growing .
maybe many of you have notic@@ ed this with loved ones , you can find somebody who can &apos;t recognize their face in the mirror , or can &apos;t tell anyone in their family , but you can still find a sh@@ ard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing . and with that you can bring back parts of people &apos;s memories and person@@ alities .
we have identifi@@ ed over 400 species of be@@ es in pennsylvania .
it &apos;s okay on fra@@ ppe@@ d-@@ out agri@@ cultural land .
and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa .
and that has fe@@ ature si@@ zes down to about 20 nan@@ ome@@ ters , and it &apos;s a complex 3d structure .
dou@@ g ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter won@@ ders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smar@@ ter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
there &apos;s no compar@@ ison at all .
the first drug for hiv / aids was not developed for hiv / aids .
and we learn , of course , many , many pleas@@ ures , but many of them are b@@ ase . and one of them , of course , is bi@@ op@@ hi@@ lia -- that we have a response to the natural world that &apos;s very profound .
and she didn &apos;t see him for years .
and then that was it .
you &apos;re a class b fel@@ on , life@@ time sex offen@@ der .
ah , because you know , it &apos;s im@@ permanent .
we are born into a box of time and space .
and then you find these things and you &apos;re happy or un@@ happy .
so imagine if we could create the world &apos;s first r@@ ating system in which we could score fo@@ ods according to their anti@@ angiogen@@ ic , can@@ cer@@ -@@ prev@@ ent@@ ative proper@@ ties .
i believe a story there has to be told .
now let &apos;s imagine that you were an econom@@ ist in 192@@ 9 , trying to for@@ ec@@ ast future growth for the united states , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cli@@ ff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic dis@@ aster certainly in the 20th century .
so , you can see we mat@@ ched them perfectly , perfectly .
and another way that you saw , sort of , this sort of , this anti@@ pa@@ thy towards the chinese is through docum@@ ents like this .
i &apos;m sure many people here have heard about pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we asked medi@@ tat@@ ors , who have been doing that for years and years and years , to put their mind in a state where there &apos;s nothing but lo@@ ving kin@@ dness , total avail@@ ability to sen@@ ti@@ ent being .
but if we were fre@@ ely fall@@ ing through the space , even without this hel@@ p@@ ful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , un@@ de@@ fle@@ cted straight pa@@ ths through the universe .
so i said , &quot; well , perhaps we should constru@@ ct a bio@@ sig@@ nature based on life as a universal process .
the big idea , i think , is more political .
l@@ ur@@ ching a little , but it &apos;s building .
we found nuclear mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ al genes . it &apos;s there .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this pro@@ c@@ ed@@ ure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
when you arri@@ ve at the theater , you disco@@ ver that somewhere along the way you &apos;ve lost the ti@@ cket .
you might know that f@@ at has memory .
care@@ ful exam@@ ination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the co2 changes by a few centuries .
one : production is too low . two : price is too high .
now , when you want to use the l@@ f@@ c in@@ do@@ ors , all you have to do is pull the le@@ vers out of the dri@@ v@@ et@@ rain , sto@@ w them in the fra@@ me , and it conver@@ ts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair , and we si@@ zed it like a normal wheelchair , so it &apos;s nar@@ row enough to fit through a standard do@@ or@@ way , it &apos;s low enough to fit under a table , and it &apos;s small and man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able enough to fit in a ba@@ th@@ room and this is important so the us@@ er can get up close to a toi@@ let , and be able to trans@@ fer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair .
whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
it doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six .
and i believe we need to streng@@ then this approach in modern diplo@@ macy , not only between states , but also within states .
a lot of he@@ ck@@ ling is the ten@@ sion of trying to make sure that the com@@ edi@@ an is going to be able to domin@@ ate , and over@@ come the he@@ ck@@ ler .
health was poor .
we tried to make it more difficult .
so when does this transition begin ?
so let &apos;s assu@@ me , let &apos;s deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we &apos;ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fan@@ tas@@ y air@@ planes .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t fly trans@@ -@@ atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but i assu@@ me that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expres@@ sions of , you know , bi@@ got@@ ry about ra@@ cial groups or eth@@ ni@@ c groups , because the people who are flying trans@@ -@@ atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , cap@@ ital@@ ism has been a constru@@ ctive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum@@ ness that has been a constru@@ ctive force in exp@@ and@@ ing people &apos;s real@@ m of moral awareness . i think the non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic , which is not only economic by any means -- it &apos;s not always commer@@ ce -- but it has dri@@ ven us to the ver@@ ge of a moral truth , which is the fundamental equality of everyone . it has done that .
and while i was busy working -- i was working on these col@@ li@@ ding worl@@ ds , in the day .
we can &apos;t just say , &quot; well , if they &apos;re young enough to benef@@ it from these therap@@ ies , then they &apos;ll live 30 years longer . &quot;
they can make some edu@@ cated gu@@ esses .
and this is all a physical simulation of the body , using ai to drive virtual mus@@ cles in that body .
super@@ man &apos;s parents die on kr@@ yp@@ ton before the age of one .
but the simple act of kin@@ dness from a complete stran@@ ger will un@@ stit@@ ch you . &quot;
the chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
and this is really the question .
the ball is dri@@ ven by three special whe@@ els that allow re@@ zero to move into any direction and also move around his own ax@@ is at the same time .
and by the way , as i take sh@@ ots at old technologies , i want to as@@ sure everybody , and particularly the au@@ tom@@ o@@ tive industry -- who &apos;s been very suppor@@ tive of us -- that i don &apos;t think this in any way compe@@ tes with air@@ planes , or cars .
so why are we not eating insects yet ?
i like animals , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to industri@@ alize their production and to chur@@ n them out like they were wr@@ en@@ ches .
it certainly is .
sometimes , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as may , but summer always comes eventually . &quot;
i &apos;m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage .
i think it &apos;s people &apos;s curi@@ osity that motiv@@ ates them to come into the projects .
think of the diversity of the web . it &apos;s a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
and i saw from a young age that having a de@@ cent job and ear@@ ning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were strug@@ gl@@ ing .
and after a few moments , her therap@@ ist tries a new t@@ ack , and they start singing together , and gab@@ by starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she s@@ ings , in one des@@ cen@@ ding scale , she s@@ ings , &quot; let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
so i re@@ treated back to my ca@@ ve and continued to support and produce com@@ e@@ dy and let my friends use my cou@@ ch as a regi@@ onal oper@@ ations hu@@ b .

for example , there &apos;s particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on respect for the el@@ derly in east asia , associated with con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us &apos; do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine of fi@@ li@@ al pi@@ ety , which means o@@ be@@ di@@ ence , respect and support for el@@ derly parents .
so the question is , why did these men dre@@ ad can@@ ni@@ b@@ als so much more than the extreme li@@ ke@@ lihood of star@@ vation ?
and i think re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what the position is about how this sa@@ cre@@ d piece of land is to be used , having it come out of actually seeing it in a real en@@ coun@@ ter , i think makes it a more powerful di@@ alo@@ gue .
what could the future of animal products look like ?
the soci@@ et@@ al cost of this condition is huge .
in fact , of those 20,000 , 8@@ ,000 were thought to be fe@@ mal@@ es .
and as i grew up , i heard so much knowledge and so many insi@@ ghts and so much wisdom come out around this table , i began to call it the wisdom table .
anybody looking at this picture will know this dol@@ ph@@ in is surro@@ unded , and clearly his behavior is being dis@@ rup@@ ted .
think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satelli@@ tes into space .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing myself , because i think part of the work of femin@@ ism is to ad@@ mit that aes@@ the@@ tics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
but in addition , if you compare the sk@@ ul@@ l with a compar@@ ably aged chimpanze@@ e and little george bush here , you see that you have ver@@ tical fore@@ head .
on may 2@@ 2@@ nd , there was a hero &apos;s re@@ bu@@ ri@@ al in fro@@ m@@ bor@@ k , po@@ land of the 16@@ th-@@ century astron@@ om@@ er who actually changed the world .
j@@ h : i get chil@@ ls every time i see that .
we pay a price for that , but we are aware of it , and generally we will pay the price for increas@@ ed fre@@ ed@@ oms , choices and opportunities .
a tsunami of questions fle@@ w out of the mou@@ ths of children who the world didn &apos;t think were interested .
and this man sitting cros@@ s-@@ leg@@ ged is now a grow@@ n-@@ up eu@@ geni@@ o , a man who i &apos;ve known since 197@@ 4 .
and he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole myth@@ ology about ben ho@@ gan and various things .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
in the last decade there &apos;s been an explosion of use of bone mar@@ row stem cells to treat the patient &apos;s other diseases such as heart disease , v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease , or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ cs , tissue engineering , even in neuro@@ log@@ y to treat par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s and di@@ ab@@ etes .
the voice was created by a company in scot@@ land named cer@@ e@@ pro@@ c .
and i can tell you two great stories .
you know it , i know it , but let &apos;s not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we &apos;ll spend all day here .
that girl can take her iphone , put it on the robot , send an email to grand@@ ma , who lives on the other side of the country .
the children enthusi@@ ast@@ ically got after me and said , &quot; now , what do you want us to do ? &quot;
because of do@@ ct@@ or@@ -@@ patient privilege , they couldn &apos;t really tell us what was going on .
the lyn@@ don johnson that i saw in the last years of his life , when i helped him on his me@@ mo@@ irs , was a man who had spent so many years in the pur@@ suit of work , power and individual success , that he had absolutely no psych@@ ic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the pres@@ iden@@ cy was gone .
a fellow by the name of mat@@ the@@ w har@@ ris at the university of wis@@ con@@ sin in ma@@ dison actually figured out a way to stimu@@ late the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the to@@ oth gene on and produce teeth in chi@@ ck@@ ens .
ak : it had to have a ri@@ der , and it had to partici@@ pate in ca@@ val@@ ry char@@ ges .
so we have a biology of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
i predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the super@@ markets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great inci@@ dent .
does the word &quot; dest@@ iny &quot; sc@@ are you ?
but he &apos;s an absolute geni@@ us when it comes to design .
and we already see sig@@ ns of organization going on here .
you &apos;ve all seen lots of artic@@ les on climate change , and here &apos;s yet another new york times article , just like every other dar@@ n one you &apos;ve seen .
this is the boy in me getting lucky again .
and you are seeing , now , that data being trans@@ posed on to ben 8@@ 7 .
and at the risk of so@@ und@@ ing gran@@ di@@ ose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
an analysis of this res@@ pi@@ ro@@ cy@@ te , designed by ro@@ b frei@@ t@@ as , indi@@ c@@ ates if you re@@ place 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versi@@ ons , you could do an olymp@@ ic spr@@ in@@ t for 15 minutes without taking a bre@@ ath .
my self became defined by o@@ th@@ ern@@ ess , which meant that , in that social world , i didn &apos;t really exist .
not only the je@@ ws , he &apos;d taken the temple ves@@ sel@@ s .
and this was a very , very dangerous thing to do around di@@ ck feynman .
it was fantastic .
so what &apos;s actually happening is that social networks and re@@ al-@@ time technologies are taking us back .
there were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
perhaps it &apos;s no surprise that in a 2007 pe@@ w sur@@ v@@ ey , when sur@@ ve@@ yed , afri@@ cans in 10 countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods by wide marg@@ ins , by as much as 9@@ 8 percent .
he needs help getting 10 million dollars .
the one below li@@ kes to fire whenever there &apos;s a wall close by to the south .
i want to be a doctor to ser@@ ve them . &quot;
of course it hel@@ ps that fear of public failure di@@ min@@ is@@ hes as the number of ideas which have fail@@ ed incre@@ ases .
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
we can re@@ create this using a process of group dynam@@ ics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world .
and so i went on .
and so has my other incredible collabor@@ ator , mark cu@@ t@@ ko@@ sky , at stanford -- he made much larger ha@@ irs than the geck@@ o , but used the same general principles .
ari@@ an@@ na hu@@ ff@@ ington : how to succeed ? get more sleep
you have no idea how much time i spend .
there was a young inter@@ n at og@@ il@@ vy canada called h@@ unter som@@ er@@ ville , who was working in impro@@ v in tor@@ onto , and got a part@@ -@@ time job in advertising , and was given the job of advertising sh@@ red@@ dies .

freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
you &apos;re going to get it eventually . i have faith in you .
the good news about this is that the global community -- again , my brazi@@ lian friends tell me -- is pit@@ ching in to help out .
thank you , god bl@@ ess you and enjoy the day . i &apos;m steve ri@@ tz .
a wind@@ shi@@ eld co@@ ating is going to give you about 1@@ 10 degre@@ es .
what is our approach ?
the bad news , however , to this question of will evil pre@@ va@@ il , is that evil lives on .
but shouldn &apos;t we just check first that the economic system that we have is re@@ mot@@ ely capable of deli@@ vering this kind of impro@@ v@@ ement ?
we &apos;re going to simu@@ late the ga@@ it of a particular child and the surge@@ on can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that ga@@ it , before he actually com@@ mit@@ s to an actual surgery .
no one .
this is good information to have , and it &apos;s not that complicated .
these red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and li@@ ve@@ lihood for more than half a billion people .
what you can see up here is a map of the world , and we &apos;re tracking the spread of this v@@ arro@@ a mi@@ te .
i &apos;m going to let you in on that secret .
everybody now consi@@ ders themselves a cre@@ ator , and not just a vie@@ wer .
there is a ten@@ den@@ cy to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a reci@@ pe for dis@@ agre@@ ement , and for that matter , a reci@@ pe for in@@ toler@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
it &apos;s hard to do high-@@ rise .
it &apos;s highly commercial .
a cop@@ per j@@ el@@ ly m@@ old .
what i &apos;d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we &apos;ve been investig@@ ating , and that &apos;s mind-wandering .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electr@@ ons , something interesting happens .
sub@@ urban expan@@ sion to cheap land , for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the american dream .
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glas@@ ses , then almost one in five indi@@ ans will requi@@ re eye care , a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing 200 million people .
whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grand@@ children , or nie@@ ces and ne@@ phe@@ ws shop@@ ping to a farmers &apos; market . just do ta@@ st@@ ings with them .
so i was like , &quot; maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . &quot;
this is the mo@@ dus oper@@ and@@ i that we have today .
country 1 has a syste@@ matic advan@@ tage over country 2 in infra@@ structures .
what is the current state of the world &apos;s phosphor@@ us reser@@ ves ?
they divided them up into two groups .
but there was one interesting an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that i found in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia .
in one case , the students are told , &quot; but you know , if you want to change your mind , i &apos;ll always have the other one here , and in the next four days , before i actually mail it to head@@ quar@@ ters , i &apos;ll be gla@@ d to &quot; -- -- yeah , &quot; head@@ quar@@ ters &quot; -- &quot; i &apos;ll be gla@@ d to s@@ wa@@ p it out with you . in fact , i &apos;ll come to your dor@@ m room and give -- just give me an email . better yet , i &apos;ll check with you .
they have it running through ma@@ zes , controll@@ ing where it &apos;s going .
&quot; it &apos;s a glam@@ or@@ ous sha@@ de of p@@ ink . &quot;
someone &apos;s put a bri@@ ck through the window .
but the experiment is not the end of the story , because you still have to trans@@ mit that knowledge to other people .
like , we have to design things which are co@@ her@@ ent as a single object , but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale .
and it &apos;s the cost of driving that &apos;s making people want to be able to do this .
to further streng@@ then their brand , they actually have professional p@@ .@@ r. fir@@ ms that shape how the press talks about them .
so if we put you in the categ@@ ory of you &apos;ve got sy@@ phili@@ s , we can give you pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin .
and amaz@@ ingly , that evolution susta@@ ins the traject@@ ory that biological evolution had estab@@ li@@ shed toward greater comple@@ xity .
and the bom@@ b@@ sight will tell him when to drop the bom@@ b .

this is the piece that i told you about .
what is origami ?
if they agree -- and you don &apos;t want to know what happens if they don &apos;t -- they train them and they super@@ vis@@ e them on how to run the most efficient cri@@ min@@ al operation for that town , in exchange for roy@@ al@@ ties .
don &apos;t over@@ do the bot@@ o@@ x ; nobody will think you &apos;re honest .
and these birds , what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve comp@@ lied all the recor@@ ds , all the available recor@@ ds of these birds , put them together , and found out they migra@@ te at exactly the same time as the dra@@ gon@@ flies .
ste@@ ven pin@@ ker &apos;s book the blank s@@ late argu@@ es that all humans are born with some in@@ na@@ te traits . here , pin@@ ker talks about his thesis , and why some people found it incredibly up@@ setting .
it &apos;s a non@@ profit association ; it rais@@ ed about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built , and then have it produced afterwards .
well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
they connect in a man@@ hole like this . literally , this is where the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ mile c@@ able plu@@ gs in .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a not@@ e@@ book and recor@@ ded their every movement .
and this is the name of my campaign : sing campaign .
the libr@@ ari@@ ans were afraid their jobs were going to disappe@@ ar .
people like this are so inspi@@ rational .
mi@@ gu@@ el ni@@ co@@ le@@ li@@ s : a monkey that contro@@ ls a robot with its thou@@ ghts . no , really .
this work is 15 years old .
so if you think about it , these are really dra@@ matically impro@@ ving .
well , she did that because she , at that time , had ac@@ qui@@ red a new arm .
i &apos;m not poli@@ tically attra@@ cted to her , but through her life force , i &apos;m attra@@ cted to her .

so the van@@ tage point you take determin@@ es virtu@@ ally everything that you will see .
now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up .
look , ours is more red , it &apos;s longer .
and these are two an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es -- one was in cam@@ bo@@ dia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no telephone , but has bro@@ ad@@ band internet now .
now i was pretty psych@@ ed .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
well , we call him an under@@ dog because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and go@@ li@@ ath is this big , strong giant .
and this is , today , the first time in any sort of public setting i &apos;ve ever ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged the journey that i have been on .
some people will say it &apos;s for bi@@ om@@ et@@ ric security .
now , how do we de@@ du@@ ce where the galaxy is ?
this is con@@ flu@@ ent small@@ po@@ x , in which there isn &apos;t a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by les@@ i@@ ons .
this is the africa that is changing , that chris all@@ u@@ ded to .
and it really thro@@ ws people for a loo@@ p because we think , well , there &apos;s no non@@ verb@@ al cu@@ es , so why don &apos;t you lie more ?
well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and cut and pa@@ ste addi@@ tional dna sequences into it .
and to make his pra@@ yer book he used par@@ ch@@ ment .
but a product that is valu@@ ed by a custom@@ er is used by a custom@@ er , and use is what creates impact .
when i went to yale , we had the first energy crisis , and i was designing the first sol@@ ar-@@ he@@ ated house in ireland as a student , which i then built -- which would give you a sense of my ambi@@ tion .
and i think the message of this is very clear .
it all made sense , with 9@@ 1 percent of the people living there .
i &apos;ve been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years , and so it &apos;s ir@@ on@@ ic that the problem that and question that i most gra@@ pp@@ le with is how you actually define poverty . what does it mean ?
the only thing that &apos;s different is the expression that the individual do@@ or@@ -@@ ow@@ ner here put into the piece -- and , again , which is the psycho@@ -@@ kil@@ ler here ?
i really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal refle@@ ction on teaching strategy and metho@@ d@@ ology and class@@ room man@@ a@@ gement , and just all of those different fac@@ ets of the class@@ room .
you &apos;re going to build the sy@@ s ad@@ m@@ in force inside the u.s. military first .
and then once that c@@ able was on sh@@ ore , they began to pre@@ p@@ are to connect it to the other side , for the c@@ able that had been brought down from the land@@ ing station .
and will it happen ?
car@@ ol@@ ine la@@ vel@@ le plays the cell@@ o like a sor@@ cer@@ ess ca@@ sting a sp@@ ell , occasi@@ on@@ ally hi@@ ding behind her wild man@@ e of bl@@ on@@ d hair as she s@@ ings of pa@@ stor@@ al the@@ mes . she per@@ forms &quot; far@@ ther than the sun , &quot; bac@@ ked by thomas dol@@ by on ke@@ y@@ boar@@ ds .
let &apos;s look to the plays of shakespe@@ are , the di@@ alo@@ gu@@ es of pla@@ to , the no@@ vels of jan@@ e au@@ sten .
people are starting to figure this out .
so i think people who study sen@@ sation or memory without reali@@ zing why you &apos;re la@@ ying down memories of childhood .
i bet , in a couple of years , that phr@@ ases like &quot; co@@ working &quot; and &quot; cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing &quot; and &quot; time ban@@ ks &quot; are going to become a part of everyday vern@@ ac@@ ular .
no ! they &apos;re not for safety .
so i did .
probably in a few years , you &apos;ll check into your mirror and it &apos;s going to be diagno@@ sing you .
it has a magnetic quality that dra@@ ws me in .
it is yours to interpre@@ t .
the whole thing took two days out of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ day week .
and in the particular example we have here , it &apos;s a film , &quot; twi@@ sted issues , &quot; and the first person says , &quot; now this is sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly a film . it fa@@ ils the google test miser@@ ably . &quot;
but it &apos;s not ir@@ relevant .
and he hand@@ -@@ sele@@ cted a team of local ab@@ original people to work on this project .
and finally , well , there are those who believe that corruption is un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
what if we had an african television network that bro@@ ad@@ cast di@@ verse african stories all over the world ?
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
we had our best ph@@ .@@ d@@ . students , our most advan@@ ced equi@@ p@@ ment around the world , we got 1 / 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ th of the project done , so how &apos;re we going to get this done in 15 years ?
and i &apos;m going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk .
in this one , the cre@@ ator told a narra@@ tive about how she had googl@@ ed to find out when mother &apos;s day was happening .
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
that &apos;s the issue , right ?
it &apos;s moving by itself , okay .
but not when they &apos;re together like that .
every top ad@@ ds up to 37 .
because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vac@@ ate their home .
i &apos;m going to tell you about why i became a sculp@@ tor , and you may think that sculp@@ tors , well , they deal with met@@ a , they deal with objects , they deal with bodies , but i think , really , what i care about most is making space , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve called this talk : making space .
but dra@@ ke &apos;s idea here became very popular because it was very appe@@ aling — and i &apos;ll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment , which didn &apos;t succeed , we have been doing se@@ ti ever since , not continu@@ ously , but ever since .
the reason i &apos;ve taken this time is i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated to hear some of the re@@ actions to this .
now finally , we can measure earth &apos;s energy im@@ balance precisely by meas@@ uring the he@@ at content in earth &apos;s he@@ at reser@@ vo@@ irs .
it was easier to get can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine , faster even , in the pris@@ on than outside the pris@@ on .
what you &apos;re going to see -- we &apos;re going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the pa@@ ths of vo@@ y@@ ager 1 , vo@@ y@@ ager 2 , pione@@ er 11 and pione@@ er 10 , the first four space@@ craft to have left the solar system .
so where do we go from here ?
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
but what &apos;s interesting is the incredible deta@@ iled information that you can get from just one sens@@ or like this .
i &apos;d like to start with a couple of quick examples .
the vast gras@@ s@@ lands of pat@@ ag@@ on@@ ia are turning to desert as you see here .
everything you need to succeed , you already have , right here .
i mean , real je@@ wel@@ ers put little bits of sol@@ der in .
thank you .
let me go back to di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a for a second .
and he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those con@@ crete objects .
i know i have about eight minutes fuel .
we can &apos;t see the cor@@ rid@@ ors , and we can &apos;t see what it is that brings together a tun@@ a , a lea@@ ther@@ back and an al@@ bat@@ ross .
we &apos;ve been getting text messa@@ ges back like these .
and by the matrix , i mean literally the matrix , like the movie &quot; the matrix . &quot;
i call it the software up@@ grade parado@@ x -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times , you eventually ru@@ in it .
when ben franklin was car@@ ried from the const@@ itu@@ tional conven@@ tion in september of 17@@ 8@@ 7 , he was stopped in the street by a woman who said , &quot; mr. franklin , what have you wr@@ ought ? &quot;
this not only lets you view twi@@ t@@ ters in different ways , but it introdu@@ ces new use cases as well .
now if you look at the cost of op@@ e@@ c , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the mil@@ ken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 197@@ 6 , is what we paid for oil from op@@ e@@ c .
he says , &quot; how many zer@@ os in a trillion ? i &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
there is a lot of appreci@@ ation for the kind of cool architecture .
that &apos;s the alli@@ ance that changes the world .
i &apos;ve been co@@ vering the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an@@ -@@ isra@@ el@@ i conflict since 198@@ 1 .
they tra@@ cked these on a separate website .
so in that reg@@ ard , this is one of the things , this is one of the privile@@ ges of being , and here &apos;s another role , the invent@@ or , and by the way , when i told you that i &apos;m the world &apos;s greatest , if you &apos;re keeping score , we &apos;ve had nar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism and soli@@ p@@ s@@ ism and now a healthy dose of e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c@@ ism .
and most importantly , if the sta@@ ir@@ case is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ si@@ st@@ ent under@@ current of dis@@ satis@@ fac@@ tion in modern life .
if we come back to our exponenti@@ al growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an inse@@ ct and a mouse brain .
the &quot; 18@@ 12 over@@ ture &quot; isn &apos;t worth wa@@ king for .
this talk is about ri@@ gh@@ ting writing wr@@ on@@ gs .
instead of building play , this can be appro@@ ached with ro@@ le-@@ play .
so , it all worked out well .
now this is not new . this is prac@@ tically not new to ted@@ sters .
an el@@ derly , wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ha@@ i@@ red man stands up .
well , i hate to break it to you , those aren &apos;t other body parts controll@@ ing your behavior .
the carbon mapping of america , where is the co2 being em@@ it@@ ted , for many years only ham@@ mer@@ ed this argument in more stron@@ gly .
well , i say yes , and if there is , i give the prize to darwin .
it &apos;s -- you know , today i &apos;d like to say it &apos;s a zero billion dollar business , but , in fact , it &apos;s negative .
less@@ on number three : at@@ al@@ ant@@ a .
you know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
so , it says , &quot; you want to lo@@ g sexual activity .
and three things kept coming up for every problem : corruption , weak institutions and the people who run them -- the leaders .
thank you .
two more than people , and the same as a gor@@ ill@@ a .
i don &apos;t think we can afford too much of such eth@@ ical choices .
because this isn &apos;t the 199@@ 0s anymore .
you guys ready ?
ps : don &apos;t get off . you don &apos;t get off , but don &apos;t worry about me .
and four mod@@ alities where you need to take some action and get involved .
we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of &#91; women &#93; at the top of any industry .
and i don &apos;t know who she is either , but this is the &#91; 16@@ th &#93; century equivalent of a super@@ model .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
during the process of making these fil@@ ms i found myself taking photographs , often much to the anno@@ y@@ ance of the video camer@@ amen .
and the technology that we se@@ tt@@ led on as an ide@@ al partner for the se@@ a@@ water greenhouse is con@@ cent@@ r@@ ated solar power , which uses sol@@ ar-@@ tracking mir@@ r@@ ors to focus the sun &apos;s he@@ at to create electricity .
but indeed , that is exactly what we do .
look at the cei@@ ling , you see all these light bul@@ bs .
and you can see , they all follow the same line .
or tradition@@ ally , the ger@@ man education divi@@ des children at the age of 10 , very young children , between those de@@ em@@ ed to pur@@ sue care@@ ers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers , and that main@@ ly along soci@@ o@@ economic lines , and that paradigm is being challen@@ ged now too .
&quot; okay , what is she telling you to write ? &quot;
she comes from an odd place .
but david &apos;s young and he &apos;s smart and he wants a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . , and he pro@@ ce@@ eds to build -- he pro@@ ce@@ eds to build the first ever li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al battery of this chemistry .
we make a dist@@ in@@ ction between talking from a diplo@@ matic level and talking at the political level .
now if bill clin@@ ton had said , &quot; well , to tell you the truth ... &quot; or richard ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s favorite , &quot; in all c@@ and@@ or ... &quot; he would have been a dead gi@@ ve@@ away for any li@@ es@@ po@@ tter than knows that quali@@ fying language , as it &apos;s called , quali@@ fying language like that , further dis@@ cre@@ di@@ ts the subject .
we need to engage and find ways of off@@ ering gui@@ dance to these young people , because they are a remarkable bre@@ ed .
but i &apos;ve got a pretty good idea how people will be@@ have when they get there .
so you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
so the stadium has a few elements which create that out@@ door comfort . first of all , it &apos;s sha@@ ding . it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and war@@ m wind .
now , if we bring it back to de@@ ception , there &apos;s a couple of ta@@ ke@@ -@@ away things here .
hands up -- how many of you have books , c@@ ds , dv@@ ds , or videos lying around your house that you probably won &apos;t use again , but you can &apos;t quite bring yourself to throw away ?
pan@@ ka@@ j g@@ he@@ ma@@ w@@ at : actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
it sounds like a lot , but it is literally 18 minutes of what we &apos;re spending in iraq -- we &apos;re spending 8 billion dollars a month ; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars -- so this is actually cheap .
my daughter came to england from ku@@ wait .
so here we are back to the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .
now , you &apos;ve all seen &quot; in@@ convenient truth . &quot; this is a little more in@@ convenient .
charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behavi@@ ors , as he wrote in his 18@@ 72 mon@@ ogra@@ ph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
i want to fin@@ ish up on a more up@@ beat no@@ te .
and the reason is , it &apos;s about appreci@@ ation and it &apos;s about contribu@@ tion . you can only feel so much by yourself .
but that is , in principle , the way you solve the &quot; fe@@ ver of un@@ explained orig@@ in &quot; problem , because each one of those spo@@ ts then becomes a test for a particular set of mark@@ ers of disease , and this will work in du@@ e course .
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a p@@ da and an app@@ lication on a p@@ da might re@@ place those techni@@ cians in a fit@@ ting and diagno@@ stic service .
and we can play with this .
they live up there , and slightly to one side .
and those things lead to things like this .
but i &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
and this woman right here , um ah@@ mad , is a woman who lives on a path in northern jordan .
dr. v : when you grow in spiritual consciousness , we identify with all that is in the world so there is no explo@@ itation .
this little sy@@ r@@ inge con@@ tains the moral molecule .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pu@@ mp for a company called appro@@ te@@ c , in ken@@ ya .
we &apos;ve had economic analysis poin@@ ting out that , not only can we afford it , it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er to act early .
i knew there were portu@@ gu@@ ese men o &apos; war , all kinds of moon j@@ elli@@ es , all kinds of things , but the box j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish from the sou@@ thern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters .
is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control .
we can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as lin@@ u@@ x : sort of an open source thing , right , where ideas from one person can be cop@@ i@@ ed and pro@@ pag@@ ated across the entire system , that there can be speci@@ alized versi@@ ons of chinese food , you know , depen@@ ding on the region .
still under foreign domin@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , india and china are down in the corner .
the he@@ bre@@ w writers in the old te@@ stam@@ ent , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this .
i wanted to figure out how to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze my own profi@@ le online .
this is one page of work from a chem@@ ist &apos;s work@@ book , ok ?
we &apos;re doing 12 cities for china right now , based on cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le as tem@@ plates .
and i said , &quot; oh , girls , dad is a very important journalist , that just wouldn &apos;t do at all . &quot;
she grew up on a farm in au@@ stri@@ a , very poor , didn &apos;t have very much education .
these whales are about 40 feet long , and wei@@ gh@@ ing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
because we want this to be difficult , and i &apos;ll tell you why mom@@ ent@@ arily .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on i@@ de &apos;s knowledge , and start looking at sal@@ es and expor@@ ts , and be able to ta@@ p into other kinds of capital .
it &apos;s like science has become that horri@@ ble story@@ t@@ eller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody car@@ es about , where you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , i met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these u@@ gly je@@ ans .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
and once the mus@@ cle &apos;s contra@@ cted completely , everything &apos;s stor@@ ed up -- the lat@@ ch flies up@@ ward , and you &apos;ve got the movement .
when you were little , i bet you spent time enjo@@ ying the pleas@@ ure of primi@@ tive art .
so , i &apos;m not going to quote myself on this .
you would do something , because it &apos;s literally impossible to pen@@ et@@ rate somebody &apos;s physical space and not get a reaction .
dir@@ t poor , no money , living with my parents , i again said , &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s su@@ sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to motion by the air curr@@ ents .
it &apos;s not just about terrorism , though .
the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m f@@ ed up with this tyran@@ ny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
the link between the past and the future is fra@@ gi@@ le .
the walls were blue , the windows were blue , the si@@ de@@ walk out front was pain@@ ted blue .
we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works .
i &apos;ve got to say thank you to my wife and family , for my kids , thank you for coming every day , and for my colleagues , believ@@ ing and sup@@ porting me .
proto@@ cell ab li@@ kes to dance around for a bit , while proto@@ cell b does the f@@ using , okay ?
i &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : pl@@ us-@@ 7@@ .@@ 6@@ 8@@ 2@@ 4@@ 5@@ 8@@ 37 minutes that will be my gi@@ ft to you if i &apos;m successful in my mission .
because he did something that was at the fr@@ ing@@ es .
but it was an exciting experience .
now it &apos;s not a l@@ one nu@@ t , it &apos;s not two nuts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
they did a fine job , but had a couple of read@@ ability problems .
in oc@@ tober , 2007 , u.s. and co@@ ali@@ tion forces ra@@ i@@ ded an al qaeda safe house in the city of sin@@ j@@ ar on the sy@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der of iraq .
cour@@ t : sleep .
so when be@@ ver@@ ly and i were born , there were 4@@ 50,000 li@@ ons , and today there are 20,000 .
and what they were saying on this occasi@@ on was that our competi@@ tors had to build new buildings for the new technology .
that &apos;s my e@@ je@@ ction seat .
they tend to eat a plan@@ t-@@ based diet .
so we &apos;ve been looking at the idea of competition as a way of co@@ oper@@ ating in order to get fit together .
and the only explanation i can have for some of what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last four days is that it ar@@ ises , in fact , out of a form of love .
let me show you thail@@ and , see what a success story , thail@@ and from the 196@@ 0s -- how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as swe@@ den .
thank you very much .
my right leg will be un@@ bur@@ den@@ ed , my right foot will fre@@ ely meet the wi@@ re .
now it &apos;s also a beautiful oper@@ a , and we &apos;re moved by that oper@@ a .
it has lots of different information about what &apos;s the process going on in this prote@@ om@@ ic conversation on many different sc@@ ales .
i realized that the day would only have two possible out@@ comes : either ca@@ therine would come back to the hotel , or she would never come back to the hotel .
now , le@@ sters in le@@ ster@@ land have this extraordinary power .
thank you very much .
in addition , the re@@ venue gener@@ ated from that char@@ coal is 2@@ 60 million dollars .
too often these days , ro@@ unds look very much like this , where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient .
pla@@ stics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are re@@ covered .
and con@@ sol@@ ation behavior , it &apos;s empathy dri@@ ven .
i would love to see google maps inside some of these ca@@ ves .
well , i got interested in this because it seem@@ ed to me that it was an obvious question .
but no you don &apos;t .
fran@@ co , thank you so much .
and building is the next of the behavi@@ ors that i thought i &apos;d talk about .
if any of the more ro@@ w@@ di@@ er children questi@@ oned the auth@@ ority of the parents , they were sc@@ ol@@ ded .
and symbo@@ lic@@ ally , the colors of the inter@@ ior are green and yellow .
while you &apos;re sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-@@ foot@@ er , or you can adjust it for the six-@@ foot@@ -@@ six guy -- all within the scop@@ e of a few simple ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments .
it monit@@ ors your bra@@ in@@ waves continu@@ ously , when you &apos;re sle@@ eping .
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside after@@ ward .
things where you might trip across things like the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can principle , the fer@@ m@@ i parado@@ x , the anth@@ ro@@ pi@@ c principle , the orig@@ in of life .
this is the gay lifest@@ yle .
this is the bil@@ ly boo@@ k@@ case -- it &apos;s i@@ ke@@ a &apos;s biggest s@@ elling product .
we have a big gap in that money . we &apos;re cu@@ tting cor@@ ners , and every time we cut cor@@ ners , more places get infe@@ cted that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slo@@ ws us down .
if you &apos;ll par@@ don the expression .
the cul@@ min@@ ation of this is if you &apos;ve success@@ fully rais@@ ed your ta@@ d@@ pole , obser@@ ving the behavi@@ oral and develop@@ mental events , you will then go and introduce your ta@@ d@@ pole to its nam@@ es@@ a@@ ke and discuss the evidence that you &apos;ve seen .
now , it &apos;s hard to program a robot to do de@@ lic@@ ate things like this , but it turns out my colleagu@@ e , pie@@ ter ab@@ be@@ el , who &apos;s here at berk@@ ele@@ y , has devel@@ el@@ op@@ ed a new set of techni@@ qu@@ es for teaching robots from example .
the ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ er , to@@ by se@@ d@@ g@@ wi@@ ck , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby hor@@ se , which was made out of sticks and bits of twi@@ gs , grew up into the big hor@@ se .
to put it mil@@ dly , i didn &apos;t do very well .
i photographed that entire experience at five-@@ minute inter@@ v@@ als .
she comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
the original name in my book was actually called the long mar@@ ch of general t@@ so , and he has mar@@ ched very far indeed , because he is swe@@ et , he is fri@@ ed , and he is chicken -- all things that americans love .
so , what if we had bec@@ k ho@@ o@@ ked up to a spe@@ ct scan , something that could actually measure brain function ?
and they say , &quot; well , streets don &apos;t have names .
they want to figure out how things work , and they want to do it in groups , like this hack@@ ers clu@@ b in washington , d@@ .@@ c. , that uses our materials to offer community cour@@ ses .
and a couple of years ago at am@@ d , we came up with this idea of saying , what if we create this initi@@ ative we call 50@@ x@@ 15 , where we are going to a@@ im , that by the year 20@@ 15 , half of the world will be connected to the internet so that people and ideas can get connected .
so -- i ar@@ range the spa@@ des -- the clu@@ bs .
the re@@ use of sy@@ ring@@ es now exc@@ e@@ eds that and kill@@ s 1.@@ 3 million people a year .
so you end up , number three , not swi@@ mm@@ ing , in the case of fre@@ est@@ yle , on your sto@@ mach , as many people think , re@@ aching on top of the water .
this , i think , repres@@ ents one of the most beautiful classic sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles built .
what did we find ? we found that si@@ x@@ - to 13@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds can self-@@ instru@@ ct in a connected environment , ir@@ respe@@ ctive of anything that we could measure .
and that &apos;s the evolution of the system .
our fa@@ ke re@@ vie@@ wers talked about who they were with and what they were doing . they also used the first person sing@@ ular , i , way more than the people that actually sta@@ yed there .
thank you very much .
so , we followed up . what happened ?
if you could pick up the white area , it would look like the figure on the bottom .
so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .
but what is interesting about the story that i &apos;ve just said ?
the next morning at church , she asked others how they felt .
and the link i cli@@ cked on here , well , le@@ mur@@ s , mon@@ keys and chimpanze@@ es have the little op@@ is@@ th@@ en@@ ar .
for example , dan p@@ ink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &apos;t seen it : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
so if you have the opportunity , please try it out .
we feel that individuals with autism , in fact , have a very special perspective on the world , and we need diversity , and they can work extremely well in some areas of streng@@ th : predi@@ ct@@ able situations , situations that can be defined .
i created a little oil sp@@ ill in the gulf of mexico .
it &apos;s not the post that should count .
i have a short notice to give you . &quot;
and the fact is , millions is a gross esti@@ mate because we don &apos;t really know how many kids die each year of this .
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant . why is it relevant ?
and so what we do in the next step is we rele@@ ase one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rop@@ e -- because if he pul@@ ls at the rop@@ e , it disappe@@ ars and the whole test is over .
they not only motiv@@ ate you to be@@ have in certain ways , but they change the way you think .
we want you to be our eyes , we &apos;ll give you the legs .
ok , now , i want you to be aware of all the different sen@@ sations around you , because we &apos;re going to try a vo@@ o@@ do@@ o experiment right now .
now , traditional se@@ ctor is where africa produ@@ ces its agriculture , which is one of the reasons why africa can &apos;t feed itself , and that &apos;s why it must im@@ port food .
and i said , &quot; well , i would just , every student work at their own p@@ ace on something like this and we &apos;d give a das@@ h@@ board . &quot;
there is an ab@@ undance of young stars , so it &apos;s the ex@@ act op@@ posite of the predi@@ ction .
now , the other type of man@@ tis shri@@ mp is the s@@ ma@@ sh@@ er sto@@ ma@@ topo@@ d , and these guys open up sna@@ ils for a living .
this is normally when people start kind of shu@@ ff@@ ling in their po@@ ckets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode des@@ per@@ ately .
and can we afford not to ? thank you .
as it has moved global , moved us toward a global level of social organization , it has dri@@ ven us toward moral truth .
you can add a third dimension@@ ality to the film .
it is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agre@@ eing upon ourselves that there is a clear eth@@ ic upon which we can build .
he wanted a bigger band .
a lot of these ideas mi@@ gr@@ ated into the production tra@@ il@@ ers for air@@ stream .
they had been using non@@ violence for about two years but had gro@@ wn dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted since nobody was pa@@ ying attention .
chris and i were really ama@@ zed by the potential now with modern web brow@@ s@@ ers , where you have ht@@ m@@ l@@ 5 audi@@ o and video and the power of ja@@ v@@ as@@ cri@@ pt to ren@@ der amaz@@ ingly fast .
and gan@@ es@@ ha said , &quot; you went around &apos; the world . &apos; i went around &apos; my world . &apos; &quot; what matters more ?
now , the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital .
any computer designers in the room ?
some ideas i &apos;ve had is like , look , the reality is -- kids in the south bronx need ap@@ ples and car@@ ro@@ ts and so do kids in bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a .
you also need graphi@@ cs , right ?
but then if you think about it , the squ@@ id has this terrible problem because it &apos;s got this dying , th@@ ick culture of bacteria and it can &apos;t susta@@ in that .
so , then we come back to alex@@ ander and to the g@@ ym@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist .
and watch that beginning to happen .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
it &apos;s not very good . it &apos;s clu@@ tter@@ ed .
but it &apos;s not the only problem .
while our sele@@ ction process is not as ri@@ gor@@ ous as nasa , it &apos;s nonetheless th@@ or@@ ough .
it has three different kinds of str@@ ings .
and so there &apos;s about seven or eight cities already in the u.s .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of ca@@ ke . i like challenges .
here &apos;s why .
there &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from al@@ ga@@ e and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life .
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organi@@ ze the whole thing is .
the point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria exper@@ t .
but , of course , since then , the web and mobile tele@@ ph@@ ony , along with ubi@@ quit@@ ous reality tv forma@@ ts have spread all around the world .
and i stopped expe@@ cting things to really change .
now sometimes neuro@@ scientists need to identify individual molecular compon@@ ents of neurons , molecules , rather than the entire cell .
it &apos;s just that it doesn &apos;t explain anything .
then human beings ste@@ pped out of the darwin@@ ian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution , which was we changed the environment in which we evolved .
bur@@ n@@ ham had designed a ra@@ il@@ road station that was never built , and so we followed .
she lo@@ ves her computer -- she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything .
there will be stronger stor@@ ms and greater f@@ loo@@ ding .
well , there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we &apos;re talking about it now .
so , having seen the impact of this , andrew and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up , to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could .
when david roll@@ s it around like this , he &apos;s turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolu@@ tions per second , and that means that when the rock is rele@@ as@@ ed , it &apos;s going forward really fast , probably 35 meters per second .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted kenne@@ dy and dan qua@@ yle meet in the well of the sen@@ ate .
men@@ sa , as you know , is an international organization for people with very high i@@ q .
the ide@@ als of partici@@ pat@@ ory democracy are repres@@ ented through sup@@ pl@@ eness rather than ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty .
and there &apos;s an or@@ ch@@ id that might look to you as if it &apos;s got ja@@ ws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the inse@@ ct to cra@@ w@@ l out , getting covered in po@@ llen that it takes somewhere else .
it &apos;s pun@@ ctu@@ ated by three quick an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , which show how acci@@ dent@@ al en@@ counter@@ s with strange no@@ ises gave us some of the most important information we have about space .
and trade is another important in@@ cen@@ tive against violence .
li@@ ke@@ wise , as we &apos;re developing policies to try to encourage expor@@ ts , if we know there &apos;s this ex@@ tern@@ ality -- this extra thing that &apos;s going to happen as we increase expor@@ ts -- we can think about what the right kinds of policies are .
but i &apos;m convin@@ ced that it &apos;s because you &apos;re walking around the streets and seeing things .
now , each one of them is thinking , &quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
and why do i say it ?
but we found that when we de@@ vi@@ ated from the specific se@@ t@@ ness of the mathematical code that under@@ lies it -- the simple algorith@@ m cro@@ ch@@ et three , increase one -- when we de@@ vi@@ ated from that and made em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
couple of kil@@ os more for the wing sp@@ ars .
and most security decisions have a variety of people involved .
it blo@@ cks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
contr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , tax@@ pa@@ yers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in pris@@ on . you &apos;ve got to pay for your own life .
cultural values that em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze respect for older people contr@@ ast with the low status of the el@@ derly in the u.s .
the yemen times already has a strong re@@ pu@@ tation in yemen as an independent english language new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
we add japan to it .
and that again pro@@ ves that when you &apos;re talking about un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequences , it &apos;s not that easy to know the right lessons to draw .
and i was there thinking about what was going on .
but this next decade -- and that &apos;s a real thing .
if all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different si@@ zes , larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains , and the larger the brain , the more cogni@@ tively able its ow@@ ner should be .
it &apos;s common . it &apos;s fres@@ h .
and then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way .
as we try to build this view , and try to edu@@ cate ourselves about the enorm@@ ity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gi@@ gan@@ tic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trilli@@ ons .
and so i &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot;
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
we might learn something unexpected .
so you see that because of the way we per@@ cei@@ ve quanti@@ ties , as the war dra@@ gs on , the number of soldi@@ ers com@@ mitted to it and the casu@@ al@@ ties will increase not lin@@ early -- like 10,000 , 1@@ 1,000 , 12@@ ,000 -- but exponenti@@ ally -- 10,000 , later 20,000 , later 4@@ 0,000 .
ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the m@@ ere men@@ tion of ge@@ o@@ engineering is being gre@@ et@@ ed in some circles , particularly media circles , with a re@@ lief tin@@ ged with eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a .
you need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something .
they wanted band integra@@ tion , that is , the machine acting upon the band members , specifically not the other way around .
and i think there are clearly right answers to that .
in case you &apos;re finished with toi@@ let paper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the wall .
and the cor@@ relation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn &apos;t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
and how do we do that ?
and we have to go also beyond traditional diplo@@ macy to the survival issue of our times , climate change .
it doesn &apos;t mean that if you are a republi@@ can that i &apos;m trying to convince you to be a demo@@ cr@@ at . we need republi@@ cans as well . this used to be a bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an issue , and i know that in this group it really is . become poli@@ tically active .
they start off on all sorts of goo@@ fy projects .
you know very well about profess@@ ors .
on one of them , car@@ ve : &quot; problems are solu@@ ble . &quot;
and the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain .
but we took the air condi@@ tioning out of the to@@ wer .
guil@@ t , in@@ ver@@ sely cor@@ related with those things .
we can continue going along at 12 dollars a net , and the custom@@ er pa@@ ys zero , or we could at least experiment with some of it , to charge one dollar a net , co@@ sting the public se@@ ctor another six dollars a net , give the people the dig@@ ni@@ ty of choice , and have a distribution system that might , over time , start susta@@ ining itself .
sal@@ ty , because you need s@@ alt , other@@ wise your electric body will not work .
but we discovered it by self-@@ exploration .
how s@@ is@@ yp@@ he@@ an this task was of men@@ ding , and yet aware of that comple@@ xity , hum@@ bled by it , he wasn &apos;t paraly@@ zed by it .
my wife coun@@ ts them among her most tre@@ as@@ u@@ red moments as a mom .
it was as though time had stopped .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s so true .
always i &apos;ve found two , but the wrong color . spa@@ des , sorry .
some people say this is because we have better diagno@@ sis , and more people are being found out .
and it &apos;s called fund@@ raising .
introdu@@ ction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
now , in order to harv@@ est it -- i mean , what &apos;s harv@@ est@@ ing ?
it pres@@ up@@ poses that we can &apos;t be what we already are .
i don &apos;t know whether they will decide to have this honor code .
in contr@@ ast , the@@ ta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual process@@ ing , things where the dri@@ ver is thinking quite a bit .
and i said , &quot; if you &apos;re serious , i will try to find a family for her . &quot;
i was going to show four main projects .
in sing@@ apo@@ re , we have a group going to use the char@@ ter to he@@ al di@@ visions recently that have sprung up in sing@@ apo@@ re@@ an society , and some members of the parliament want to imple@@ ment it poli@@ tically .
sure , the bru@@ ise hur@@ ts like hell , and you almost certainly don &apos;t like the dis@@ color@@ ed look , but we all know the bru@@ ise per se is not the problem .
what we know about this fo@@ x@@ p@@ 2 and ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als is that they may have had fine motor control of their mou@@ ths -- who knows .
there &apos;s a very simple flu@@ id to begin with .
human growth has stra@@ ined the earth &apos;s resources , but as jo@@ han rock@@ strom re@@ minds us , our advan@@ ces also give us the science to recognize this and change behavior . his research has found nine &quot; planet@@ ary bo@@ un@@ dar@@ ies &quot; that can gui@@ de us in prote@@ cting our planet &apos;s many over@@ la@@ pping eco@@ systems .
p@@ g : witness was born of technological innovation -- in a sense the small , port@@ able , d@@ v c@@ am was really what allowed it to come into being .
i went .
one is our prote@@ stant work eth@@ ic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working aren &apos;t respe@@ cted .
and that was , &quot; how did this happen to me ? &quot;
it you s@@ low down , you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of col@@ li@@ sion .
the alternative , which was proposed by ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi , was to institution@@ alize and make poverty permanent .
and if i go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; here , have some drin@@ ks on us ! &quot;
well , steve , i would love every news media ow@@ ner to hear that talk at some point in the next year . i think it &apos;s really important . thank you so much .
basically , a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state , emp@@ ha@@ tically , &quot; i &apos;m a little c@@ ab@@ in in the wo@@ ods . there &apos;s nothing on either side of me .
two months later , something incredible happens .
it was cru@@ cial that the students see that we &apos;re working hard for them and they &apos;re all sup@@ porting each other .
this is the earlier design of that house .
in the summer , you go to the beach .
you can see sharks in every single di@@ ve .
and one young ran@@ ger in the back -- his hair &apos;s t@@ ous@@ led and his face is red and wind@@ blo@@ wn from being in comb@@ at in the cold afgh@@ an wind -- he said , &quot; sir , i was in the si@@ x@@ th grade . &quot;
but what would you think was the second largest group , convin@@ c@@ ingly out@@ nu@@ mber@@ ing je@@ ws with 2.@@ 8 million , muslims at 1.@@ 1 million , and hin@@ dus , budd@@ hi@@ sts and all other religi@@ ons put together ?
teach a soli@@ d week . okay , i &apos;m teaching three-@@ quar@@ ters time , but good enough .
i said , &quot; your honor , &quot; and i don &apos;t know whether i was em@@ b@@ ol@@ den@@ ed by the scientific measu@@ re@@ ments that i had in my po@@ cket and my knowledge that they are accurate , or whether it was just she@@ er stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty , which is what the defen@@ se law@@ yers thought — — when they heard me say , &quot; yes , your honor , i want you stand right there and i want the car to go around the block again and i want it to come and i want it to stop right in front of you , three to four feet away , and i want the pas@@ sen@@ ger to ex@@ tend his hand with a black object and point it right at you , and you can look at it as long as you want . &quot;
mar@@ gar@@ ine didn &apos;t exist .
she is edu@@ c@@ ating the indi@@ gen@@ ous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy , about how you bring democracy to the country , about edu@@ c@@ ating , about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about vot@@ ing ; it &apos;s about being an active citi@@ zen .
if my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagno@@ sed me as something like gender dy@@ s@@ mor@@ phi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty .
we opened the li@@ d , we took the hor@@ se out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be rid@@ den .
well done , well done .
their business traject@@ ory would change .
and the english set up cro@@ m@@ well and a whole bunch of republi@@ cans or whatever , and not the kind of republi@@ cans we had .
the com@@ modi@@ ty bo@@ oms are pump@@ ing un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented amo@@ un@@ ts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
and she said , &quot; he wants to know who you are . &quot;
now , why would a phan@@ tom limb be paraly@@ zed ?
even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos , it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so .
i know that in 198@@ 9 he no longer rul@@ ed the so@@ vi@@ et union , but that &apos;s the best picture that i can find .
they can pause , repe@@ at at their own p@@ ace , at their own time .
we changed completely our strategy .
just to illu@@ strate what to do about the nu@@ b of the problem , nam@@ ely , light vehi@@ cles , here are four ultra@@ -@@ light car@@ bon@@ -@@ com@@ posite concept cars with low dra@@ g , and all but the one at the upper left have hybri@@ d drive .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
he &apos;s going down the path .
and that &apos;s what all these machines are doing , except , instead of doing it with mar@@ bles , they &apos;re doing it with electr@@ ons .
the truth is , we only know the out@@ lines , and what we don &apos;t completely understand , we can &apos;t proper@@ ly fix .
so be aware of the bear .
this has come &apos; ro@@ und to be that all those na@@ ked pa@@ ch@@ y@@ der@@ ms have a@@ qua@@ tic ance@@ stors .
&quot; imagine you run faster than those go@@ ats you are looking after . &quot;
and yet , in all its mess@@ iness , in all its diffic@@ ul@@ ties , i would not have liked somebody to say , &quot; this is the tab@@ ul@@ a ras@@ a , mi@@ ster architect -- do whatever you want . &quot;
this is a 16@@ th century image to show you how wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad his v@@ ener@@ ation actually was .
so that &apos;s the bert ru@@ tan designed spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p ?
r@@ ca started this whole thing off , and said , you know , telev@@ isi@@ ons are the future , not computers .
but i &apos;m hop@@ eful that future generations can .
and then the fru@@ it of the world for silicon valley today .
and he pro@@ ved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video con@@ fer@@ encing .
so i kind of said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s this extra ingre@@ dient , you know , that you need to create a new fro@@ g from the mom and dad fro@@ g . &quot;
one hour after she saw her first industrial robot , she had programm@@ ed it to do some tas@@ ks in the fac@@ tory .
scientists like to name things .
but we wor@@ ship the high hospital on a hill . right ?
and it &apos;s open to us to introduce a new way of doing that , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ll talk about for 10 minutes , or whatever the time rema@@ ins .
she wi@@ el@@ ds great power .
and after that , we succe@@ e@@ ded .
and he said , &quot; i need your arms , but i need two of them . &quot;
first time we ever tried it . we &apos;ll try to get it better later but 12 months so far .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
so what does it take ?
so these are the gentle@@ man who played ben@@ j@@ amin .
it &apos;s about the rou@@ ter of one network , a facebook or a google or a b@@ .@@ t@@ . or a com@@ cast or a time war@@ ner , whatever it is , conne@@ cting with usually a yellow fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ able up into the cei@@ ling and down into the rou@@ ter of another network , and that &apos;s un@@ equi@@ v@@ oc@@ ally physical , and it &apos;s surpris@@ ingly inti@@ mate .
that &apos;s pretty good , but why not get rid of the wir@@ es ?
so , i &apos;m curi@@ ous about what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days .
i was the black a@@ thei@@ st kid in the all@@ -@@ white ca@@ tho@@ lic school run by n@@ uns .
here &apos;s my approach to it all .
so here &apos;s some in@@ organic life .
you might have seen images about the po@@ st-@@ election violence that happened there in 2008 .
i &apos;m a very lucky person .
they picked these sex@@ y cars .
and you need to remember that to be good is not enough .
well a ser@@ mon wants to change your life and a le@@ cture wants to give you a bit of information .
we &apos;re going to go on a di@@ ve to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lo@@ vely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
we just talked to him . here &apos;s jen@@ ny , one of the nur@@ ses , alli@@ son , who helped manage the transplant list , and a do@@ zen other people who aren &apos;t pic@@ tured , a phar@@ mac@@ ist , a psych@@ ologist , a nutri@@ tion@@ ist , even a financial coun@@ sel@@ or , li@@ sa , who helped us deal with all the in@@ sur@@ ance has@@ s@@ les .
and as i was doing it , what happened ?
and this was a cause for celebra@@ tion .
it &apos;s just ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
that &apos;s the second of the quad@@ ru@@ ple .
but when they were divided , indeed they were divided , and we do see the contin@@ ents car@@ ving differences among dinosau@@ rs .
first off , ryan and i decided to create a non@@ profit called re@@ vi@@ ve and restore that would push de-@@ extin@@ ction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way , and we would push ahead with the pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on .
but beyond our personal reasons for w@@ ant@@ ing to be there , there is a huge need .
all of us who &apos;ve experienced re@@ gre@@ t that con@@ tains real pain and real g@@ rief understand that hum@@ or and even black hum@@ or plays a cru@@ cial role in helping us survive .
so here is what we did . we put a 10@@ -@@ cent digital trans@@ pon@@ der , a data tag , in the appli@@ ance plu@@ g .
now impro@@ vis@@ ation is em@@ power@@ ing because it wel@@ comes the unknown .
i find a lot of people have diffic@@ ul@@ ty doing that .
now , some people call her the first progra@@ mmer .
one of our gradu@@ ate students then says , well , how does a dri@@ ver@@ less car communicate with pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans ?
it was like your roman@@ tic vision of europe .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
this was consi@@ dered as first evidence that actually black hol@@ es come from super@@ no@@ va@@ e explo@@ sions .
i did a performance with two sing@@ ers who speci@@ alize in making strange no@@ ises with their mou@@ ths .
what i am trying to do as a photograph@@ er , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together .
they have son@@ gs , po@@ em@@ s , no@@ vels , sculp@@ tures , pain@@ t@@ ings , my@@ ths , le@@ gen@@ ds .
but , when you go to another lin@@ ked data site -- and let &apos;s say this is one about travel , and you say , &quot; i want to send this photo to all the people in that group , &quot; you can &apos;t get over the walls .
we will never again have a political class that was for@@ ged by the experience of fighting together in world war i@@ i against a common enemy .
i &apos;d like to share with you how that happened , and also describe my experience of being psycho@@ tic .
but to create a space that never exi@@ sted is what interests me ; to create something that has never been , a space that we have never enter@@ ed except in our minds and our spi@@ ri@@ ts .
i just can &apos;t tell you -- there &apos;s one thing i want to tell you .
after six months of work , he came to my office and pres@@ ented me with those nine words on a piece of paper .
and what i heard , it kind of distur@@ bed me .
and to ask that question -- happy is not a word i use very much -- we &apos;ve had to break it down into what i think is as@@ k@@ able about happy .
is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
and one of those competi@@ tions , i just won a small , little transi@@ st@@ or phili@@ ps radio .
it could be new products and services , but it could also be new ways of producing products .
not one custom@@ er would re@@ fer us .
so that &apos;s not the most fun part of this research , although it &apos;s interesting .
when i look back now from this high hill of my old age , i can still see the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed women and children lying he@@ ap@@ ed and sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed all along the cro@@ o@@ ked gul@@ ch as pla@@ in as when i saw them with eyes still young .
and he said , &quot; that &apos;s convenient . &quot;
we were in the process of giving birth to our first child .
in this office you do not work and write and draw on a she@@ et of paper , but you draw directly on a kind of huge wh@@ ite@@ board ca@@ ve , like a pre@@ histor@@ ic scientist .
the final step is , of course , the product , whether it &apos;s a pack@@ aging material , a table top , or building block .
sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
we were a bit surprised when we found out that when we ex@@ posed fro@@ gs to very low levels of at@@ ra@@ zine -- 0@@ .@@ 1 parts per billion -- that it produced animals that look like this .
and the process we made was not about changing the look , it was about impro@@ ving the product completely .
you &apos;re also talking about base@@ ball .
it &apos;s the only as@@ ym@@ metri@@ cal expression .
top@@ co@@ der has 40@@ 0,000 engineers who are deli@@ vering complex design and engineering services .
i am bill gates and i write the code .
for me , the world is ve@@ ering towards a future we don &apos;t much want when we really think about it deep inside .
if there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?
we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
a woman told me there , her mother used to tell her , &quot; don &apos;t wear pan@@ ties , de@@ ar , underneath your pa@@ j@@ am@@ as .
now , this is actually becoming such an interesting idea .
the size of the bubble here is the population .
they went from designing sp@@ lin@@ ts for wo@@ unded soldi@@ ers coming out of world war i@@ i and the kor@@ e@@ an war , i think , and from this experiment they moved on to cha@@ irs .
sar@@ ah kam@@ in@@ sky tells the extraordinary story of her father adol@@ f@@ o and his activity during world war i@@ i -- using his in@@ genu@@ ity and talent for for@@ gery to save lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and she goes , &quot; u@@ h ... no . &quot;
there are many .
what are the sorts of things that people talk about across discipl@@ ines ?
cs : this is the gun .
but at first i did not know what to do .
and i said , &quot; thank you for doing mov@@ em@@ ber . &quot;
now , they diff@@ er a great deal in terms of the predi@@ ct@@ ability of time fra@@ mes .
it was a table as long as this car@@ pet and the h@@ arb@@ or com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er was here , and i was here , and my guys .
and they pre@@ p@@ are it in a wonderful way .
this is a high-@@ al@@ titude helium balloon .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
and that &apos;s what art is .
they turn then , shoul@@ der to shoul@@ der , and walk away , lost in their own re@@ ver@@ ie .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechan@@ ism , called red@@ d plus -- a sche@@ me for the redu@@ ced emissions from de@@ for@@ est@@ ation and forest de@@ gra@@ da@@ tion .
there &apos;s many myster@@ ies , these stat@@ ues .
this is for real .
finally , we have homes . we use inter@@ ior designers .
i got the back legs .
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
and the west is eng@@ aging with that .
it &apos;s as if , when you bought a book , they thre@@ w in the printing press for free ; it &apos;s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pres@@ sed the right butt@@ ons .
he was in pur@@ suit of the result .
and the one over there , that &apos;s bigger than my head , is what mcdonald &apos;s and bur@@ ger king and those big companies think we should eat .
now here &apos;s something -- a 3d prin@@ ter .
that would be simple . then we know what to do .
and of course , this is ner@@ d hea@@ ven , right ?
99 percent of their electricity comes from ren@@ e@@ w@@ able resources .
who &apos;s in charge ?
and that is , they had bar@@ ely left , and there wasn &apos;t a tra@@ ce in the sand .
ok , go ahead , mix them up .
and the buildings , they don &apos;t only sort of inv@@ o@@ ke the ima@@ gery of the mountains , they also oper@@ ate like mountains .
i think it &apos;s the basis of anim@@ ism and poly@@ thei@@ s@@ m and mon@@ o@@ thei@@ s@@ m .
four years later , i still get probably two or three hundred e@@ ma@@ ils a day from people i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ?
let me be qu@@ ie@@ t for a second because this is so gor@@ geous .
it really is the garden of e@@ den .
this he@@ art@@ beat is lou@@ der than death .
p@@ é@@ ter fan@@ k@@ haus@@ er : meet re@@ zero , the dancing ball@@ bot
they were two life@@ times of the same hero .
the philosop@@ her mar@@ th@@ a nu@@ ss@@ baum points this out in this quote : &quot; th@@ us throughout history , certain dis@@ gu@@ st proper@@ ties -- sli@@ min@@ ess , bad sm@@ ell , sti@@ ck@@ iness , deca@@ y , f@@ oul@@ ness -- have been repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously been associated with ...
through const@@ ant experiment@@ ation with materials , they developed a wide range of icon@@ ic solutions that we know today , eventually resul@@ ting in , of course , the le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y lo@@ un@@ ge chair .
i love that lei@@ lei said that the way of helping those who are suffering b@@ ad@@ ly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time , doing it by having a good time .
at his day job , steve tru@@ g@@ lia fli@@ ps cars , wal@@ ks through fire and falls out of buildings -- pus@@ hing technology to make stun@@ ts bigger , sa@@ fer , more awesome . he talks us through his next st@@ unt : the highest jump ever attemp@@ ted , from the very edge of space .
that &apos;s not my sli@@ des , but it &apos;s okay .
in particular , they were ob@@ s@@ essed with the story of grey po@@ upon . right ?
ten years ago , on a tu@@ es@@ day morning , i condu@@ cted a par@@ ach@@ ute jump at fort bra@@ g@@ g , north car@@ ol@@ ina .
so i said , &quot; professional w@@ rest@@ ler . &quot;
it &apos;s business anywhere .
children can use it . adults can use it . everybody uses it .
imagine it &apos;s late 199@@ 0 , and you &apos;ve just met a nice young man named tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ le@@ e , who starts telling you about his proposed system called the world wide web . ian ri@@ tch@@ ie was there . and ... he didn &apos;t buy it . a short story about information , conne@@ ctivity and learning from mistakes .
information process@@ ing is very dynamic and adap@@ tive .
it &apos;s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before .
for me , it began as i was appro@@ aching my third act , my 6@@ 0@@ th birthday .
i have a little mantra .
so thank you guys .
for most western young women of today , being called a femin@@ ist is an insu@@ lt .
i can promis@@ e you this was such an emotional moment in my laborat@@ ory .
our bodies get vitamin d from the sun , but as der@@ mat@@ ologist richard w@@ eller sugge@@ sts , sun@@ light may con@@ fer another surprising benef@@ it too . new research by his team shows that ni@@ tri@@ c oxide , a chemical trans@@ mit@@ ter stor@@ ed in huge reser@@ ves in the skin , can be rele@@ as@@ ed by u@@ v light , to great benef@@ it for blood pressure and the car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar system . what does it mean ? well , it might begin to explain why sc@@ ots get si@@ ck more than australi@@ ans ...
in a recent mi@@ mi@@ cking study at the university of c@@ ler@@ mon@@ t-@@ fer@@ rand in fr@@ ance , subje@@ cts were asked to deter@@ mine whether a s@@ mile was real or fa@@ ke while holding a pen@@ cil in their mou@@ th to repres@@ s s@@ mil@@ ing mus@@ cles .
they don &apos;t catch them in a net .
so , i took 15 different li@@ sts from key thin@@ kers , like the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia britan@@ ni@@ ca , the museum of natural history , car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s cosmic calendar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point ; these were just li@@ sts in reference works , and i think that &apos;s what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution .
human@@ kind has been looking for the giant squ@@ id since we first started taking pictures underwater . but the el@@ u@@ sive deep@@ -@@ sea pre@@ dat@@ or could never be cau@@ ght on film . oce@@ an@@ ograph@@ er and invent@@ or edi@@ th wid@@ der shares the key in@@ sight -- and the team@@ work -- that helped to capture the squ@@ id on film for the first time .
but i didn &apos;t , ok . so we &apos;re here . i &apos;ll do what i can . i &apos;ll do what i can .
i think this tells us there is an opportunity .
and yet , for the most part , our culture has not come to terms with what this means .
a long time ago , back in the early 190@@ 0s , muse@@ ums were out looking for dinosau@@ rs .
i &apos;ll explain what that means . we &apos;re looking at three trends .
so that &apos;s the other gene we &apos;re looking for .
but here &apos;s the problem : every doctor in the world , every hospital admini@@ str@@ ator , has seen tv -- cur@@ se those &quot; e.@@ r. &quot; r@@ er@@ uns .
thank you so much .
i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed so much strange love , and i fell very natur@@ ally into its be@@ wit@@ ching patterns .
but what happened was that ma@@ da@@ gas@@ car went through a violent cou@@ p .
and if you remember that we need to increase agri@@ cultural production by 70 percent , we &apos;re not going to make it that way .
nearly every year for more than a hundred years , it &apos;s looked like this in the summer .
in 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,@@ 600 cases .
actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years &apos; time .
hit@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any .
so that &apos;s the bottom line .
markets have changed beyond recogni@@ tion in the last 20 years , but only for organi@@ zations at the top of the economy .
sher@@ man &apos;s up in shark hea@@ ven .
let me introduce to you re@@ zero .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teen@@ a@@ gers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
why ? there is the cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st ri@@ des@@ h@@ are board .
that it &apos;s about communication that doesn &apos;t just produce greater understanding within the individual , but leads to real change .
that &apos;s an extreme of micro@@ p@@ thal@@ mo@@ s called en@@ op@@ h@@ thal@@ mo@@ s .
instead , the only american ads fe@@ at@@ uring wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ha@@ i@@ red old people are ads for re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment homes and pen@@ sion plan@@ ning .
we know that the dance behavior is an ori@@ ent@@ ation behavior and it &apos;s also a ther@@ mor@@ e@@ gu@@ lation behavior , and we also know that they use a path integra@@ tion system for finding their way home .
it &apos;s that simple .
t , see it &apos;s the same as f in music .
we didn &apos;t gras@@ p what was going on .
ru@@ by wa@@ x : what &apos;s so funny about mental illness ?
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design s@@ w@@ at team .
but there are two things at heart that i think drive a con@@ servative philosoph@@ y that are really relevant to this whole debate .
one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a no@@ bel prize .
everybody lost faith in me being able to re@@ cover .
so the friend of a friend of a &apos;s is , back again , a friend of a &apos;s , wh@@ ere@@ as the friend of a friend of b &apos;s is not a friend of b &apos;s , but is far@@ ther away in the network .
and this is the trend in well-@@ being over that time , a small increase , but this is the trend in e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal footprint .
after the tra@@ ge@@ dy , survival stories began to emer@@ ge .
fol@@ dit , a game created by computer scientists , illu@@ str@@ ates the value of the approach .
j@@ b : he did . he pulled in every fa@@ vor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day .
&quot; &apos; i give life and i take it away .
because the gol@@ den rule is difficult . i sometimes -- when i &apos;m speaking to con@@ gre@@ ga@@ tions about compassion , i sometimes see a mu@@ tin@@ ous expression cros@@ sing some of their faces because a lot of religi@@ ous people pre@@ fer to be right , rather than com@@ passionate .
and as we watch it , we are as@@ ha@@ med .
so it was coming in , and arri@@ ving at the city at the nor@@ th@@ west , which is why s@@ mi@@ th@@ field , london &apos;s very famous meat market , was located up there .
and then we wonder why the mem@@ bran@@ e clo@@ gs and why it takes so much electricity .
daniel tam@@ met : different ways of knowing
it was , for a long time , re@@ vered as the most reli@@ able of cars , and then they had the big re@@ call inci@@ dent .
that was all done on a machine that looks like this .
until now , these people have fac@@ ed a rather un@@ pleas@@ ant choice .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help muslims progress -- the highest per@@ cent@@ age of any country we sur@@ ve@@ yed .
and when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
and then third , from what i &apos;ve heard from the entrepreneurs i &apos;ve gotten to know , when all else is equal , given the option to have just money to do what you need to do , or money plus the support and encoura@@ gement of a global community , people choose the community plus the money .
20 years back the political slo@@ gan was , &quot; ro@@ ti , kapa@@ da , ma@@ ka@@ an , &quot; which meant , &quot; food , clo@@ thing and shel@@ ter . &quot;
they &apos;re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that class and they &apos;ll give you the grade . &quot;
now the question comes to mind : is there any hope ?
and what i &apos;m trying to do with my work is put faces to this .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral re@@ ef@@ s -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
so i think this expla@@ ins why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution , all of the while rema@@ ining just a pri@@ mate brain .
don &apos;t let mil@@ k spo@@ il your morning .
and actually the second general hospital in vi@@ en@@ na , in about 18@@ 50 , was where we started to build out an entire cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um for teaching med students speci@@ al@@ ties .
and that means your computer is going to get its ones and zer@@ os mix@@ ed up , and that &apos;s going to cr@@ ash your machine .
so oxy@@ tocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in ma@@ mm@@ als .
you know about a lot of them .
and yeah , that &apos;s all .
si@@ ck@@ ness , health , ten@@ der violence .
the discovery of hyper@@ bo@@ lic space us@@ her@@ ed in the field of mathematics that is called non-@@ eu@@ cli@@ de@@ an geome@@ try .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
and so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ r@@ oni@@ st@@ ically a classi@@ fication by fa@@ thers &apos; occu@@ pa@@ tions , so single parents go on their own .
well , at enormous expen@@ se , ted has ar@@ ran@@ ged a high-@@ resol@@ ution immer@@ sion virtual reality ren@@ dering of inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space -- the view from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space .
you f@@ ought by day , then it was sun@@ set , so everyone went back home .
i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjo@@ yed his presence .
she took over as execu@@ tive dire@@ ctor .
2007 was a great year .
so i ac@@ ted like a two-@@ year-old and re@@ f@@ used to work .
and all of a sudden , this plastic ba@@ g was extremely beautiful to me .
so to get people war@@ med up , let &apos;s start with an easy question -- something i &apos;m sure everybody here has an op@@ ini@@ on about : iphone versus and@@ ro@@ id .
den@@ nis van@@ en@@ gel@@ s@@ dor@@ p : bee . okay , thanks .
but the short story is : if you &apos;re a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
very em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing .
there &apos;s 12 different drugs , 11 different cancer types .
so what we &apos;d like to pro@@ pose is that we use them to invol@@ ve people from all around the world in an histor@@ ic first : the world &apos;s first truly global po@@ ll and consu@@ l@@ tation , where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time .

and rapi@@ dly we started to realize that be@@ a@@ vers can be something that a bo@@ b@@ c@@ at needs .
so now people can say , &quot; i want exactly this and this and this , &quot; and you can go out and fold it .
is not so much that the wing has some interesting mor@@ ph@@ ology .
ok . what &apos;s that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things .
are the bas@@ ics of driving a car learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ?
and so we think it &apos;s really , what matters , i mean , where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situations like social threat situations . where are you being ev@@ al@@ u@@ ated , either by your friends ? like for teen@@ a@@ gers it &apos;s at the lun@@ ch@@ room table .
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flo@@ ws back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benef@@ iting a grand@@ child or two .
i &apos;m going to ski@@ p ahead here . at some point we get larger , and we actually get to a ma@@ cro@@ -@@ evolution scale .
this ch@@ art is going to docum@@ ent a very similar trend .
if you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this , but what scientists are doing now is they &apos;re understanding what these do and what they mean .
one is what &apos;s on the boston public library .
that &apos;s all i have . thank you .
this is the field of biologi@@ c replac@@ ements , where we re@@ place wor@@ n-@@ out parts with new , natural ones .
well , medical mal@@ practice li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation in the us has es@@ cal@@ ated the cost of mal@@ practice in@@ sur@@ ance , so that compe@@ tent physi@@ cians are leaving their practice .
for the people who were there and looking at that se@@ ction , it was remarkable .
and the same ves@@ sel@@ s that are feeding tumor@@ s allow cancer cells to ex@@ it into the circu@@ lation as meta@@ st@@ ases .
all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old , and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country .
and why this is interesting is that if you put on , say , a pair of safety glas@@ ses , that have two in@@ fr@@ ared dots in them , what these two dots are essentially going to give you is , give the computer an appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tion of your head location .
and instead of char@@ ging a dollar-@@ fif@@ ty for the ei@@ ght-@@ o@@ un@@ ce bottle , the way that french &apos;s and gul@@ den &apos;s did , they decided to charge four dollars .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
now let me move to another place .
they &apos;re hi@@ red -- they &apos;re paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nur@@ ses .
that &apos;s what i want this side to think about .
people wrote in for re@@ prin@@ ts of that thing .
this is not what i expected , trust me .
so , it &apos;s a fa@@ ke real .
and there are three seconds left on the clock .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazi@@ l -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazi@@ lian model ? -- but look at sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa .
so , now , there are a lot of web 2.@@ 0 consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts who make a lot of money .
each of them taken together is unlikely .
what i ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomen@@ ally good at text messa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?
intervie@@ wer : not up and down ? boy : no .
they follow the characters . they &apos;re smart enough , we hope , not to bu@@ mp into each other . they go off on their own .
this one is very lo@@ w-@@ power .
african agriculture today is among , or is , the most under@@ -@@ cap@@ itali@@ zed in the world .
a good example for this informa@@ tional non-@@ visual us@@ er inter@@ face is called air@@ pi@@ x .
the us@@ da cannot be seen as the be@@ -@@ all and en@@ d-@@ all of what we feed our kids and what &apos;s allowed .
he &apos;s won all the fi@@ ghts , he &apos;s el@@ u@@ ded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he &apos;s come to the city of alex@@ and@@ ria and realized he &apos;s lost .
the gras@@ s@@ lands were swe@@ eping away .
this is one of the rare situations where i have no emp@@ ty portraits .
with the service economy , it is about impro@@ ving quality .
it &apos;s boo@@ sted to ne@@ ar-@@ space at@@ op a min@@ ot@@ au@@ r i@@ v rocket .
and it turned out that one of the guys there , a friend of mine that i never actually met , but be@@ fri@@ ended through some pro@@ p de@@ als , was the man@@ ager of a local fo@@ undry .
now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aware of them ?
thomas e@@ dison had the same problem .
that is a wonderful thing .
and i love them because they pay the r@@ ent on time .
that is , until i went to edu@@ ardo &apos;s farm in extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a , 50 miles north of se@@ ville , right on the portu@@ gal bor@@ der .
it &apos;s just two dro@@ ps , like that .
we &apos;ve created a pres@@ um@@ ption that if you &apos;re a patient at that hospital with an el@@ ev@@ ated b@@ m@@ i , the four walls of the doctor &apos;s office probably aren &apos;t going to give you everything you need to be healthy .
and i &apos;m showing you core war here , which is an early game that takes advan@@ tage aes@@ the@@ tically of the limit@@ ations of the process@@ or .
the first bad news is that the chan@@ ces of getting treatment are extremely sli@@ m to none , and that &apos;s because most of the blin@@ dness alle@@ vi@@ ation programs in the country are focused on adults , and there are very , very few hospit@@ als that are actually equi@@ pped to treat children .
because before 19@@ 80 , there were much fe@@ wer people born than there were during the last 30 years .
he told me that he &apos;d in@@ vi@@ te the test subject in , and he &apos;d say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a sna@@ ke in the next room and we &apos;re going to go in there . &quot;

it &apos;s the only copy i had . pieces of it .

however , the record hol@@ der land@@ ed just sh@@ y of the ei@@ ght-@@ foot mark , which is im@@ pres@@ sive .

the idea that the internet , which changed all of our lives , can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to an@@ alog , let alone digital -- blo@@ ws my mind .
sch@@ lau@@ g found that his stro@@ ke vi@@ cti@@ ms who were a@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , could not form sent@@ ences of thre@@ e@@ - or four@@ -@@ word sent@@ ences , but they could still sing the lyri@@ cs to a song , whether it was &quot; happy birthday to you &quot; or their favorite song by the e@@ a@@ gl@@ es or the roll@@ ing st@@ ones .
i then compare my information to the things i find on the internet -- satellite images , wea@@ ther data from wea@@ ther sta@@ tions as well as off@@ sh@@ ore bu@@ o@@ ys .
but what about acci@@ dent@@ al death ?
most of the spending in the bush admini@@ stration has actually been more related to the anth@@ ra@@ x results and bio@@ -@@ terrorism threat .
some of these things are 10 stories deep or more , and one of my cli@@ m@@ bing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we &apos;re cli@@ m@@ bing over , we would never do it .

that was a lot of negative energy , built up in there .
if we feel it now and think it through , we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .
of course , none of them liked it .
and so with flight , it &apos;s very met@@ abo@@ lic@@ ally co@@ stly .

ste@@ ven johnson : where good ideas come from
so i became interested in understanding what contribu@@ ted to a life that was worth living .
our humanity is actually defined by technology .
this is visu@@ ali@@ zing international communic@@ ations .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; i know ! look ! this isn &apos;t right . &quot;
you &apos;ll find out that people don &apos;t say what businesses think they would say .
john mc@@ wh@@ or@@ ter : t@@ x@@ t@@ n@@ g is kill@@ ing language . j@@ k ! ! !

he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the dop@@ e game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two passi@@ ons into one vision .
it &apos;s the so@@ -@@ called green machine that we introdu@@ ced with ko@@ f@@ i an@@ n@@ an in no@@ v@@ em@@ ber at the world sum@@ mit that was held in tun@@ isi@@ a .
but i had changed somehow .
this is in the national the@@ at@@ re studio , the place where they co@@ ok new ideas .
think about what you might pick .
i don &apos;t mean looking at it from that way -- ab@@ using the little species .
so we wanted to see if we could introduce this char@@ co@@ al-@@ making technology there .
again , small structures , our challenge is how to make them larger , and that is something we &apos;re working on right now at the institute .
two sugar p@@ ills a day be@@ ats one sugar p@@ ill a day .
now , i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to partici@@ pan@@ ts in the clinical trial when it is po@@ or@@ ly condu@@ cted .
one day they &apos;ll get here .
that is to say , we somehow might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day .
ok , and when you feel the sen@@ sation -- it might take a while -- drop it into the glass .
so my femin@@ ism is very inde@@ b@@ ted to my mom &apos;s , but it looks very different .
so it &apos;s anti-@@ natur@@ ali@@ stic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like bre@@ ath .
and this is a route of exhibi@@ tion gar@@ den@@ s , and edi@@ ble to@@ w@@ pa@@ ths , and be@@ e-@@ friend@@ ly sites , and the story of pol@@ lin@@ ators , and it &apos;s a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town , past our caf@@ es and our small shops , through our market , not just to and fr@@ o from the super@@ market , and we &apos;re hop@@ ing that , in changing people &apos;s foot@@ fall around our town , we &apos;re also changing their behavior .

we hop@@ ed we &apos;d be funny , but we didn &apos;t know it would be a cover , and we didn &apos;t know that that image , at the moment that it happened , would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .

the big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the ex@@ act same wrong answer .

and i thought , well , this is the power of a city .
and so , we &apos;re talking about parallel planes of exi@@ st@@ ence , sort of like a book jack@@ et and the book that it covers .
he said , &quot; change ?
but i have been taking beautiful not@@ es of dra@@ wings and i have a gor@@ geous oni@@ on from mur@@ ray g@@ ell@@ -@@ mann &apos;s talk .
and we learn to live together and to get to know one another .
now , who today would claim that as a m@@ ere conc@@ eit of the human mind ?
we have a world class g@@ aller@@ y because we believe that poor kids need a world class g@@ aller@@ y , so i designed this thing .
and there &apos;s something else .
we should really invent@@ ory the don@@ ations that are pil@@ ing up here .
it &apos;s like 21@@ st-@@ century hen@@ ry moore . when you see a hen@@ ry moore still , your hair stands up . there &apos;s some amazing spiritual connect .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easier solution to this .
you see here the red ro@@ of and the gra@@ y ro@@ of , and in between them there will be a mas@@ k , which is just a blank screen , for about a quar@@ ter of a second .
and i believe that we can do it together .
and this hallu@@ cin@@ at@@ ory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is il@@ u@@ vat@@ ar .
but then as well , i was able to just fli@@ p them , ro@@ tate them and comb@@ ine them in different ways to create either reg@@ ular patterns or abstra@@ ct patterns .
and i think this is really the theme of this s@@ ession .
rapid manufactur@@ ing is a computer fi@@ le sent directly from the computer to the manufactur@@ ing machine .

we &apos;d put them in an environment where they didn &apos;t want to be , and they didn &apos;t want to do what we wanted them to do .

they are the future and i try to make them not be afraid of being the c@@ at and being told , don &apos;t think outside the box .
there were some con@@ serva@@ tion@@ ists , really famous con@@ serva@@ tion@@ ists like stan@@ ley temple , who is one of the fo@@ under@@ s of conser@@ vation biology , and k@@ ate j@@ ones from the i@@ u@@ c@@ n , which does the red list .
the first is : be aware of the propaganda .
all right .
so this may not be the perfect drug for sta@@ ying young longer .
it &apos;s the medical data explosion that we &apos;re having right now .
ks : so you see there , it didn &apos;t bo@@ un@@ ce back . now , this was an un@@ inten@@ ded side effect of some experiments they were doing .
and that too is a basis for having compassion , for understanding our place in the world .
but - 1 , - 1 - 1 , are all prime numbers .
if you take two mobi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
washington , d@@ .@@ c. , last year , actually led the nation in new green roo@@ fs inst@@ all@@ ed , and they &apos;re funding this in part thanks to a five-@@ cent ta@@ x on plastic bag@@ s .
india has many because they are many .
we &apos;re about to do six in the u.k. next week .
as my refer@@ r@@ als began to decre@@ ase , i clearly became increasingly depres@@ sed until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
and i think that one of the happ@@ i@@ est things is the sense that with my children i &apos;ve been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough , or possibly stupid enough , to still climb trees .
now , all this changes when a pre@@ dat@@ or en@@ ters the scene .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
so , some societies , for sub@@ tle environmental reasons , are more fra@@ gi@@ le than others . and then finally , another gener@@ alization . i &apos;m now teaching a course at ucla , to ucla under@@ gradu@@ ates , on these collap@@ ses of societies . what really bu@@ gs my ucla under@@ gradu@@ ate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
so this is one .
and it will be sub-@@ orbital . and the reason it has to be sub-@@ orbital is , there is not solutions for ade@@ qu@@ ate safety to fly the public to or@@ bit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
so it &apos;s not the final story , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful sum@@ mary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .
and in our world , if we keep on spo@@ il@@ ing , wa@@ sting our energy resources , if we keep on building things that consu@@ me so much energy that most of the companies now go ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt , it &apos;s clear that we &apos;ll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem .
can you even imagine what that looks like ?
when the post@@ war sub@@ ur@@ bs were first built out on the cheap land away from down@@ town , it made sense to just build surface par@@ king lots .
when we think about communication , we think about interactions .
and it &apos;s really so gra@@ ce@@ ful ; it &apos;s like a dancing ange@@ l .
so if you want to put a million things down am@@ ong@@ st eight million posi@@ tions and you can have some of them over@@ la@@ pping , the cl@@ um@@ ps will be further apart .

i made that image of dur@@ g@@ a and her every attribu@@ te , her every nu@@ ance , my very own .
and we said to that public meeting in to@@ d@@ mor@@ den , look , let &apos;s imagine that our town is focused around three plates : a community pla@@ te , the way we live our everyday lives ; a learning pla@@ te , what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share am@@ ong@@ st ourselves ; and business , what we do with the po@@ und in our po@@ cket and which businesses we choose to support .

what i &apos;m about to say , at least some of what i &apos;m about to say , will cause contro@@ ver@@ sy .
i was frustrated -- i was working as a software engine@@ er in this huge , very exciting lab , lots of people coming from all over the world .
i mean , there &apos;s not any traditional not@@ ation .
since there is no real re@@ tribu@@ tion possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes appar@@ ent that the whole notion of this mu@@ tu@@ ally assu@@ red destruction would not work .
the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emer@@ gen@@ cy .
over the coming months , i learned to brea@@ the on my own , then to sit and to stand and to walk , but my body was now divided ver@@ tically .
in@@ equ@@ alities in china and india i consider really the big ob@@ stac@@ le because to bring the entire population into growth and pro@@ sper@@ ity is what will create a dom@@ esti@@ c market , what will avo@@ id social inst@@ ability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
because it was a line from our chinese parallel susan bo@@ yle -- a 50@@ -@@ some year-old woman , a vegetable ven@@ d@@ or in shanghai , who lo@@ ves singing western oper@@ a , but she didn &apos;t understand any english or french or itali@@ an , so she managed to fill in the lyri@@ cs with vegetable names in chinese .
letters actually work .
thank you , thomas .
it &apos;s about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufac@@ ture a new product , but not a new product itself ?
all right . those are r@@ ar@@ er clouds than the cir@@ rus , but they &apos;re not that rare .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
they begin to ch@@ ant .
some of the problems that we have to con@@ front are that the current international laws -- for example , shi@@ pping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to sh@@ ore .
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being mani@@ pul@@ ated .
and i try to figure out how that works .
why not personal biot@@ ech ?
and since it was near lunch time , they said , &quot; all right , we &apos;ll give you some lunch .
you could fly 100 ph@@ .@@ d@@ . students under the um@@ br@@ ell@@ a of this concept , because my sup@@ position is that ent@@ om@@ op@@ a@@ tho@@ gen@@ ic fungi , pri@@ or to spo@@ ru@@ lation , attra@@ ct the very insects that are other@@ wise rep@@ ell@@ ed by those spor@@ es .
but one late night , when i was comp@@ il@@ ing the report i really realized my discovery . i have shown that swe@@ dis@@ h top students know stati@@ st@@ ically significantly less about the world than the chimpanze@@ es .
i came home to my wife after 1@@ 11 days of running in the sand , and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s no dou@@ bt if this bo@@ z@@ o can get across the desert , we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to . &quot;
but i &apos;m saying it &apos;s not either or .
one , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
by the end of the hand ax@@ e ep@@ ic , homo sa@@ pi@@ ens -- as they were then called , finally -- were dou@@ b@@ t@@ less finding new ways to am@@ use and ama@@ ze each other by , who knows , telling jo@@ kes , story@@ telling , dancing , or ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling .
there was resi@@ stance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
and where i &apos;ve tar@@ ge@@ ted is on the hea@@ v@@ y-@@ du@@ ty tru@@ cks .
the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is sen@@ ti@@ ent .
here they are working .
they can be inter@@ cep@@ ted , and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad inten@@ tions .
like i &apos;ll read that one of the two attribu@@ tes of matter in the new@@ ton@@ ian universe -- there are two attribu@@ tes of matter in the new@@ ton@@ ian universe -- one is space occu@@ pan@@ cy . matter takes up space .
amazing number of people think they &apos;re ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f .
it &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ charge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
more and more women , two , three , four times more women , dying of heart disease than men .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
we want to satis@@ fy our individual des@@ ir@@ es .
now , go to youtube , facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the priv@@ acy of your own bed@@ room .
so we &apos;ve all heard of m@@ ris . m@@ ris use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take s@@ nap@@ sh@@ ots of your brain or your k@@ nee or your sto@@ mach , gra@@ y@@ scale images that are fro@@ zen in time .
and that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
afghanistan , we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world .
ab@@ ed and i sat with our coffee .
we &apos;ve dri@@ fted almost without reali@@ zing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
they don &apos;t like that . they think it &apos;s cr@@ ank . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cr@@ ank .
people have lin@@ ked to it , and so other people in turn link to it , etc . , etc .
the second , or a different kind of re@@ mot@@ eness is that within the large me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan areas all over the world , you have po@@ ckets , like sl@@ ums , or sh@@ ant@@ y@@ to@@ w@@ ns , or po@@ or@@ er areas , which are soci@@ ally and econom@@ ically remote from the rest of the city , so it &apos;s us and them .
well for health , i &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome ingredients that are good for my body .
i will not m@@ our@@ n the dead with mur@@ der nor suici@@ de .
this other condition was inspired by david , my student .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
and they had those expec@@ tations because ag@@ ent metaph@@ ors imp@@ ly the de@@ liber@@ ate action of a living thing pur@@ su@@ ing a goal .
it looks nothing like what we would find if we du@@ g in contemporary be@@ ds in north america .
so thank you very much .
and those were then distribu@@ ted to d@@ j@@ s who have made hundreds of son@@ gs using that source material .
so to test this crazy idea , we developed a small dun@@ e bu@@ g@@ gy prototyp@@ e vehicle to test the fe@@ asi@@ bility .
that &apos;s a rate of 7@@ ,@@ 25@@ 6 children &apos;s lives sa@@ ved each day .
when we put it through our solar ch@@ im@@ ney , we re@@ move actually about 95 percent of that .
they trained 3@@ 5,000 health exten@@ sion workers to deliver care directly to the people .
and that became the bas@@ eline of what i was doing .
acts of god . &quot; in this picture , five acts of god are as important as everything else .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
it takes a radi@@ ologist years of speci@@ al@@ ty training to become exper@@ t in differenti@@ ating the normal an@@ atom@@ ic detail from the wor@@ ris@@ ome finding .
and it is our interactions and the clu@@ ster@@ ing of those interactions .
so while egyp@@ ti@@ ans were known for their sing@@ le-@@ dig@@ it tur@@ n@@ out in elec@@ tions before the revolution , the last election had around 70 percent vot@@ er tur@@ n@@ out -- men and women .
that &apos;s extremely high .
so anyone sitting in and watching tv , get in touch with me .
i thought , this is somebody i &apos;ve got to get in this series .
this is indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
he said , &quot; if you don &apos;t want to follow my instru@@ ctions , go away . &quot;
dan used to actually hold them but now he &apos;s got you for protection .
and given the life of many of these chemicals , generations , years , do@@ zens of years , that means that we right now are affe@@ cting the health of our grand@@ children &apos;s grand@@ children by things that we &apos;re putting into the environment today .
well , in looking around for entrepreneurs , there was none better that we could find on earth than an@@ u@@ j sha@@ h , in a to z manufactur@@ ing company .
kids , when we grow up , have dreams , and we have passi@@ ons , and we have visions , and somehow we get those things cr@@ us@@ hed .
what will they do tomorrow ?
and he didn &apos;t mean the comfort of a five-@@ course dinner as opposed to a one-@@ course meal , but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .
h yes , i was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
throw a drug at it , and resi@@ stant cells will grow back .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you &apos;d have to be extremely qu@@ ie@@ t .
and i &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens .
and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do , in that un@@ certain@@ ty came a sense of freedom .
the com@@ bin@@ ation of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
that you can , not only see the marg@@ ins right there on a molecular level , but you can see it even if it &apos;s not right on the top -- even if it &apos;s beyond your field of view .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m going to cut the li@@ ver right here .
and i want to end with the story that some of you know , about wes@@ ley au@@ tre@@ y , new york subway hero .
the latin word &quot; co@@ gi@@ to &quot; is der@@ i@@ ved from the pre@@ fix &quot; co , &quot; meaning &quot; together , &quot; and the ver@@ b &quot; ag@@ it@@ are , &quot; meaning &quot; to shake . &quot;
and it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affe@@ cting our world , but it starts to go up -- because i think we can start corre@@ cting our footprint and bring it down -- but there &apos;s a growing footprint that &apos;s happening in asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so i don &apos;t think we can equ@@ alize it . so ultimately the strategy , i think , here is that we have to be very concern@@ ed about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .
each molecule f@@ its into its partner re@@ cep@@ tor and no other .
dr. v : i used to sit with the ordinary village man because i am from a village , and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in cont@@ act with his inner being , you seem to be one with him .
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an ir@@ on-@@ po@@ ur to make something new out of it .
teaching elements of per@@ su@@ asi@@ on , it doesn &apos;t get any more real than that .
people didn &apos;t know about things .
and you have politi@@ cians who have -- you &apos;re ele@@ cted . in a way , you can &apos;t say that .
so we learn a lot from war , and i men@@ tion r@@ wand@@ a because it is one place , like south africa , where nearly 20 years on , there is heal@@ ing .
so we &apos;ve all seen these . these are the &quot; your speed limit &quot; sig@@ ns .
and , as of today , it &apos;s made of these things .
i took a transl@@ ator with me , and went to this village , found the grandmother , sat down with her .
so its military budget is bo@@ und to be enormous .
they call her the &quot; tree lady , &quot; but she &apos;s more than the tree lady .
and when it fir@@ es a little spi@@ ke of electricity , there &apos;s going to be a red dot and a click .
i re@@ mind you of that 90 percent accu@@ ra@@ cy rate .
so there are two things going on .
i don &apos;t know who needs a cor@@ n sh@@ eller .
and one of the reasons why he designed roo@@ fs this way is because it &apos;s -- he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that &apos;s made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points .
if failure destro@@ ys you , then you can &apos;t do this .
to me it &apos;s an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing .
one is , for instance , tech@@ ne@@ ti@@ um is a radio@@ active el@@ ement with a deca@@ y time of 4@@ .@@ 2 million years .
and we can use such data , that &apos;s being passi@@ vely ob@@ ta@@ ined , to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network .
you can take a class in lo@@ gic , argu@@ ment@@ ation .
this emerging economy really is helping the re@@ vi@@ val of the world economy .
and so when we gave ourselves this sc@@ or@@ ec@@ ard to say well , where are we related to our goal towards 20@@ 15 , the thing that becomes appar@@ ent is three pieces .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
it &apos;s very similar to a ru@@ bens &apos; tube , and it &apos;s also used for visu@@ ali@@ zing the physical proper@@ ties of sound , such as eigen@@ mo@@ des , so let &apos;s fire it up and see what it does .
i have a studio in ber@@ lin -- let me cu@@ e on here -- which is down there in this snow , just last wee@@ k@@ end .
here &apos;s the idea .
and we run our companies like this , by the way .
he was in sud@@ an when the civil war bro@@ ke out there .
we might have to te@@ ar those books up and start to look at other op@@ tions and be open-@@ minded to see@@ k the truth .
and we discovered their human counter@@ parts are amazing .
in 2003 , we published our first success .
and with these types of anti@@ bodies , we know humans can make them .
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they dep@@ end upon the breast , and the breast shows no son pre@@ ference .
the first thing is water .
all they know about life is they get up in the morning , and if their engine starts , they go to work .
so , you know , i do what i can with the students .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
it starts off , you walk in the door .
and so i &apos;ll leave you with this thought .
he is bl@@ us@@ hing . he &apos;s bl@@ us@@ hing for his por@@ tra@@ it being made !
but then -- and here &apos;s the trick -- fe@@ hr and ga@@ chter said , on the sev@@ ent@@ h ro@@ und , they told people , &quot; you know what ? new rule .
if it wasn &apos;t possible , you had to use something fan@@ ci@@ er .
is that all we would do ? and this is an interesting question .
another great example is fi@@ deli@@ ty .
so that &apos;s thousands of little gra@@ ins of po@@ llen there , and there &apos;s the pi@@ stil there , and these are the little things called tri@@ ch@@ om@@ es . and that &apos;s what makes the flo@@ wer give a fra@@ gr@@ ance , and plants actually communicate with one another through their fra@@ gran@@ ces .
more recently , because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big in@@ puts to co@@ ordin@@ ation -- there has been a second answer , which is to put the co@@ operation into the infrastructure , to design systems that co@@ ordin@@ ate the output of the group as a b@@ y-@@ product of the oper@@ ating of the system , without reg@@ ard to institu@@ tional models .
we talked about before the h and n spi@@ kes on the surface of the flu virus .
well , the opportunity is real , but so is the je@@ opar@@ dy .
she &apos;s the one who taught me how to draw and , more importantly , how to love .
this is mar@@ la ol@@ m@@ stead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
and again , technology meant that i could do the fa@@ st@@ est ab@@ sei@@ l over 100 meters , and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without mel@@ ting the rop@@ e with the fri@@ ction , because of the allo@@ ys i used in the des@@ cen@@ der device .
there &apos;s two things that i &apos;ve learned in the last year .
the pur@@ pose was to make a cr@@ ater to ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this com@@ et , which we learned quite a bit about .
and then , as these animals swi@@ m and give us the information that &apos;s important to climate issues , we also think it &apos;s critical to get this information to the public , to engage the public with this kind of data .
and listen , i &apos;m a modern woman .
this is the great lea@@ p forward , when china fell down .
we can integra@@ te over the surface , and the not@@ ation usually is a capital sig@@ ma .
but ultimately , the government pre@@ vail@@ ed in the end , because the maj@@ ority of the british public , and certainly the maj@@ ority of members of parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be toler@@ ated in a civili@@ zed society .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
you know , it &apos;s very pleas@@ ant to walk into a small class .
knowledge and intelligence is power , and as it becomes more distribu@@ ted , there &apos;s a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant distribution and de@@ cent@@ r@@ alization and dis@@ ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation of power that &apos;s under@@ way in the world today .
often it &apos;s thought that that &apos;s an emotion that comes up out of p@@ ity .
so they know what to do .
we try to make big , permanent , important change .
and in order to explain interaction , we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives .
so we talked to kids about that , and we really start to feed kids regi@@ onal food .
i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my sen@@ ior offic@@ ers and we watched a fire@@ fight from one of our forces .
so this inter@@ depen@@ dent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we &apos;re all here in northern california doing what we do for a living , enjo@@ ying this evening -- is pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly un@@ equal .
the instru@@ ments are loud enough that they can be heard without am@@ pli@@ fication , etc . , etc .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; because i &apos;m here and it &apos;s cheap , and you know , i kind of like pittsburgh . &quot;
reg@@ ina , that was ja@@ w-@@ dro@@ pping , as they say .
ak : in port eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth , the village outside port eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth in south africa .
but i want to tell you something useful -- and here it is , so con@@ cent@@ rate now .
you want your emplo@@ ye@@ es to do what you ask them to do , and if they &apos;ve done that , then they can do extra .
ex@@ tern@@ al de@@ bt -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest deb@@ ts on the continent -- has come down dra@@ matically .
langu@@ ages con@@ tain patterns .
so we started talking , and he said , &quot; i really need a better way to measure proteins . &quot;
the e.@@ u@@ . also became a cur@@ ren@@ cy block , and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
this experience taught me to empa@@ th@@ ize more with my patients , and especially those with retin@@ al diseases .
most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the present@@ ation &apos;s free , and some of you &apos;ll be happy to know that it invol@@ ves be@@ er .
there &apos;s few animals -- i think elephants and ap@@ es can do that kind of thing -- but there are very few animals who can do that .
thank you .
the instru@@ ctions which go@@ ver@@ n this operation must be given in absolutely ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve detail .
how would a trip in a sky@@ car work ?
ju@@ lian san@@ che@@ z : i &apos;m going to make an obser@@ vation about the way re@@ mix culture seems to be evol@@ ving ...
for example , we have an in@@ sur@@ ance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pa@@ ys the same in@@ sur@@ ance as somebody who drives 3,000 .
it was the tears that were indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from the gulf that were fall@@ ing down my che@@ ek .
sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
now look , natur@@ ally there &apos;s a gap between their kind of condu@@ ct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week , but the truth is it didn &apos;t really bo@@ ther us .
but when you actually visu@@ alize it , all the conne@@ ctions that we &apos;re doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- it doesn &apos;t look technological .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustain@@ ability .
this process is a very cal@@ cul@@ ated process .
well , first you have to , as an engine@@ er , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
you won &apos;t be alone . thank you .
they can &apos;t sub@@ ordin@@ ate those interests to the greater global public good .
i &apos;m going to drink so much of it . i &apos;m going to be so healthy .
but in any case , what i &apos;m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .
and i call it &quot; home@@ town security . &quot;
if you don &apos;t change that re@@ venue picture , if you don &apos;t solve what you &apos;re doing in health care , you &apos;re going to be d@@ ein@@ v@@ est@@ ing in the young .
the electr@@ on h@@ its it suddenly .
the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time .
i hope i try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the liter@@ ature .
then the efficiency of such a b@@ ase station is only at about five percent .
and i don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you , save to say that there are very bright students , in the best universities , studying emotions in animals , studying person@@ alities in animals .
she left .
the cool thing is that we &apos;re doing as well : as you interact with him , you &apos;re able to put things into his world ; he recogni@@ zes objects .
there &apos;s an a@@ version to word problems , which descri@@ bes 99 percent of my students .
it &apos;s ax@@ i@@ o@@ matic that they &apos;re do@@ d@@ gy , and they &apos;re going to want to try and ri@@ p you off .
he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , &quot; to those who have to go without two me@@ als a day , god can only appear as bread . &quot;
i use , now , a whole new process .
i think you couldn &apos;t be human if you didn &apos;t ask those questions .
but if we come back today , during a normal condition to the ex@@ act same location , this is what &apos;s left .
and so to find one , a guy like that , you hang on to him .
it &apos;s particularly important -- this isn &apos;t on the world wide web , is it ? i &apos;m about to get fi@@ red -- it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corpo@@ ration .
they were living on top of the land they were labor@@ ing .
and it only ended because the english cri@@ ck@@ e@@ ters had to go from dur@@ ban to cap@@ e town , which is a two-@@ hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
hardly appropri@@ ate at this moment in time .
visual arts -- de@@ cor@@ ation of sur@@ faces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal .
me@@ cha@@ i vi@@ ra@@ va@@ i@@ dy@@ a : how mr. con@@ dom made thail@@ and a better place
and he told me , &quot; bio@@ sig@@ nat@@ ures , we need to look for a bio@@ sig@@ nature . &quot;
four@@ th : relations with ho@@ st@@ il@@ es . mon@@ tan@@ ans have the same problems as do all americans , in being sensi@@ tive to problems created by ho@@ st@@ il@@ es over@@ se@@ as affe@@ cting our oil supp@@ lies , and terror@@ ist attacks . and finally , last it@@ em on my che@@ ck@@ list : question of how political , economic , social , cultural at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des play into this . mon@@ tan@@ ans have long-@@ held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .
this can be in politics .
an in-@@ d@@ w@@ elling com@@ passionate presence , under@@ p@@ inn@@ ing and susta@@ ining all things .
the schizop@@ hren@@ ic mind is not spli@@ t , but sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
the sun is 9@@ 3 million miles away , and we &apos;re ti@@ l@@ ting like this , right ?
we have been able to see ner@@ ves for fac@@ ial expression , for fac@@ ial movement , for brea@@ thing -- every single ner@@ ve -- ner@@ ves for ur@@ in@@ ary function around the pro@@ state .
when drum machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the ol@@ dest form of music , the ham@@ bone rhyth@@ ms , and comb@@ ine it with the ne@@ west technology ?
we really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen .
actually , not that long ago .
you should know , the cli@@ tor@@ is of the pig , inside the vagina .
as a ma@@ gi@@ cian , i think everything is possible .
so it &apos;s fair to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?
let &apos;s see what happens . this experiment &apos;s been done many , many times .
because really , it &apos;s a condition about choice , and the lack of freedom .
what do you think of fo@@ ie gras that 99@@ .@@ 99@@ 9@@ 99 percent of the world e@@ ats ?
he &apos;s coming up to one of my gradu@@ ate students and fli@@ pp@@ er pat@@ ting , which he would do to a female pen@@ gu@@ in .
they love to touch smo@@ oth sur@@ faces rather than r@@ ough ones .
what you need to know is that the children and the adults des@@ erve flo@@ wers in their life .
and nobody knows how hard that is , but we &apos;ll probably find out in a few years .
the problem that we had with stri@@ der i is it was just too hea@@ vy in the body . we had so many mot@@ ors , you know , al@@ ig@@ ning the jo@@ in@@ ts , and those kinds of things .
entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passi@@ ons or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it .
that is , impact is gener@@ ated by people , what they consu@@ me in their aff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produced .
three : their production has been supported by government agen@@ cies at the expen@@ se of a more health@@ - and ear@@ th-@@ friend@@ ly diet .
then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
and when i was an adoles@@ cent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
and -- and so i prin@@ ted out her -- or i sent a p@@ d@@ f of her blog to her family , and they passed it out at her memor@@ ial service , and even in her ob@@ itu@@ ary , they men@@ tioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .
so that &apos;s the part of the brain that is activ@@ ated when you give a word to something .
even the business programs have started pi@@ cking up on this .
why do you do what you do ?
but the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in b@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor b@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ hi .
so that is it .
and that &apos;s why getting a good education is so important .
but if you look at creative practice as a form of research , or art as a form of r &amp; amp ; d for humanity , then how could a cy@@ ber illu@@ sion@@ ist like myself share his research ?
despite centuries of ani@@ mo@@ sity , decades of violence and thousands of people killed , 199@@ 8 saw the conclusion of an histor@@ ic agre@@ ement .
i &apos;m jo@@ king , yeah ?
it &apos;s got to be relatively fast , so you can run it on a normal machine , but it &apos;s got to be accurate enough , so it looks good enough , basically .
so you &apos;ve all got to think about this , and you &apos;ve all got to vote -- and we &apos;re not moving on .
when i was in college , i decided to study engineering , like him .
this song is called &quot; finger@@ tips . &quot;
it &apos;s something terrible , horri@@ ble .
i therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot;
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
that &apos;s 25 years ago .
ryan lo@@ b@@ o has traveled the world , taking photographs that tell stories of unusual human lives . in this ha@@ un@@ ting talk , he re@@ fra@@ mes contro@@ versi@@ al subje@@ cts with empathy , so that we see the pain of a liber@@ ian war cri@@ min@@ al , the qu@@ ie@@ t streng@@ th of un women peac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers and the per@@ sever@@ ance of del@@ hi &apos;s under@@ appreci@@ ated fire@@ figh@@ ters .
thank you .
and my final thought is that we , of course , by conser@@ ving whe@@ at , rice , po@@ tat@@ oes , and the other cro@@ ps , we may , quite simply , end up saving ourselves .
how do you cast mu@@ d ?
they challenge what &apos;s currently there .
we cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
which is , what happens if these two , three-@@ dimensional worl@@ ds should actually col@@ li@@ de ?
to get le@@ gi@@ ti@@ macy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education , primary health , roads , build hospit@@ als and clinics .
you &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
you spoke about the responsibility of the press .
this battle defined the first 150 years of the u.s. economy , and at every moment , different par@@ tis@@ ans saying , &quot; oh my god , the economy &apos;s about to collap@@ se , &quot; and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy .
c@@ et@@ ac@@ e@@ ans and pri@@ mates have also an auto@@ bi@@ ographi@@ cal self to a certain degre@@ e .
so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multi@@ media plat@@ form . we call it a lunch box .
i &apos;m hop@@ ing it &apos;s going to do well this year .
so the shor@@ ter the bar , less angiogen@@ esis , that &apos;s good .
the gre@@ e@@ ks went from the theater of di@@ on@@ y@@ sus to the par@@ th@@ en@@ on in their sand@@ als .
this is a mine in zim@@ bab@@ we right now .
or , &quot; the meeting went from three to four , &quot; in which we conc@@ ei@@ ve of time as stre@@ t@@ ched along a line .

and life starts to exp@@ and and exp@@ and and exp@@ and , until it goes ka@@ put .
i think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expres@@ sions from very hum@@ ble parts .
we built this model in new york , actually , as a theore@@ tical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come , and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like , because the ex@@ teri@@ or can change .
but there is zero cor@@ relation between i@@ q and emotional empathy , feeling with the other person .
hom@@ ar@@ o c@@ ant@@ u : and i &apos;m hom@@ ar@@ o .
i &apos;ve become very familiar with its dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional behavior .
that &apos;s what i really try and get people to understand .
and it scar@@ es you , and it fri@@ gh@@ tens you .
and the big question , of course , is why ?
the reason i know this story is because he &apos;s my neighb@@ or .
so no@@ am and i had this in@@ sight that if we want our students to understand how computers work , and understand it in the mar@@ row of their b@@ ones , then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete , working , gener@@ al-@@ pur@@ pose , useful computer , hard@@ ware and software , from the ground up , from first principles .
unbe@@ know@@ nst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the sur@@ faces were continu@@ ing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the colum@@ n , which was quite a surprising discovery .

but bar@@ ack re@@ minded us on that day , all of us in that room , that we all know what our world should look like .
well , it seems to me that this h@@ ung@@ arian presence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an ad@@ mi@@ ration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a her@@ it@@ age of guil@@ t and de@@ fe@@ at mat@@ ched by de@@ fi@@ ance and bra@@ va@@ do .
so we put this in the bas@@ ement , and we got really serious about food , like serious experiment@@ ation .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re making a little mini@@ -@@ device for each of the different cell types .

b@@ r : and we &apos;re che@@ fs . so when mo@@ to opened in 2004 , people didn &apos;t really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the lo@@ go , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requ@@ ests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousand@@ th requ@@ est for a ma@@ ki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of prin@@ ted food , and this was the first for@@ a@@ y into what we like to call fla@@ vor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the fla@@ vor of , you know , a standard ma@@ ki roll , prin@@ ted onto a little piece of paper .
so the question ar@@ ises : when do those citizens of the world turn into the langu@@ a@@ ge-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers that we are ?
and the video went vi@@ ral .
their central metaph@@ or is a lo@@ om .
&quot; and anyway , i am going away . &quot;

i &apos;ve described to you the op@@ posite of a success story .
you &apos;re talking about inclu@@ sive innovation .
and the first people who saw that were the tele@@ gra@@ pher@@ s of the mi@@ d-@@ 19@@ th century , who were the original hack@@ ers .

sometimes they don &apos;t even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line .
we &apos;re trying to -- maybe we &apos;ll change it -- but anyway , it &apos;s a war room to try to co@@ ordin@@ ate all the attack that &apos;s going on in africa , all the different social problems in africa , and try to look at best practic@@ es .
and it was an incredibly thing , working with the u.@@ n .
these are the natural cur@@ ves in space .
some people don &apos;t . and if we like them , we &apos;ve got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
because , as i &apos;ll explain to you , the questions on the small@@ est and the largest scale are actually very connected .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i &apos;d fail@@ ed .
i don &apos;t think we know enough yet .
so what it &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s replac@@ ing the retin@@ al circu@@ it@@ ry , really the gu@@ ts of the retin@@ al circu@@ it@@ ry , with a set of equ@@ ations , a set of equ@@ ations that we can imple@@ ment on a chip . so it &apos;s just math .

so , really , this is the dream and in a sense what you can think of it is we are trying to enable anyone in the world , i mean anyone in the world , to be their own edu@@ ca@@ tional d@@ j , creating edu@@ ca@@ tional materials , sharing them with the world , constantly inno@@ v@@ ating on them . so , this is the dream .
it makes it adver@@ s@@ ari@@ al . it &apos;s pol@@ ari@@ zing .

i think , myself , that life is a natural out@@ growth of the increas@@ ing comple@@ xi@@ fication of matter over time .

the appli@@ cations in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-@@ we@@ tting .
i was like , &quot; i know . that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to tell you guys all along .
what you are seeing here is an open-@@ p@@ it mine in the u.s. , and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine , if you look in the top ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner , the little c@@ ran@@ e you can see , that is a giant c@@ ran@@ e .
okay .
and a mobile phone , it turns out , is a great re@@ co@@ very tool .
how big ?

there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the gl@@ ories of human exi@@ st@@ ence .
thank you very much .
and i learned in that class -- because i would do things like this ...
she wasn &apos;t on any medi@@ cations which could produce hallu@@ cin@@ ations .
number four : always use remote control .
yeah ? ok .
talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
it wasn &apos;t until the internet came into play , that the need for libr@@ ari@@ ans went down .
six months later , the women &apos;s in@@ fan@@ ts were off@@ ered cer@@ e@@ al mix@@ ed with car@@ rot ju@@ ice , and their fac@@ ial expres@@ sions were obser@@ ved while they ate it .
and i &apos;ve found a very useful new word , ig@@ no@@ stic . okay ?
but unfortunately , you have to experience the actual hotel , air@@ line and hospital , and then you have that dis@@ connect .
he &apos;d come in and say , you know , if i am here , everything is okay .
there are no g@@ mo@@ s -- gene@@ tically modi@@ fied organisms -- whatsoever .
and i thought to myself , &quot; you know , if i could geor@@ e@@ ference this map , if i could place this map in the grid of the city today , i could find these lost fe@@ atures of the city , in the blo@@ ck@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ block ge@@ ograph@@ y that people know , the ge@@ ograph@@ y of where people go to work , and where they go to live , and where they like to eat . &quot;
al@@ right , now i &apos;m going to reduce all of this to a series of simple du@@ mb sk@@ et@@ ches .
but i also wor@@ ried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .
now this moment so fascin@@ ates me .
and people came up and picked up the cul@@ tur@@ ally res@@ on@@ ant image of the fal@@ af@@ el , ate it and , you know , talked and left .
the revolution is happening .
he was a com@@ mitted chri@@ stian .
but three of those cri@@ mes are prev@@ ent@@ able .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psychop@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers .
so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years argu@@ ing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
this is one that bl@@ ames you .
a father and daughter separ@@ ated from a bicycle by a myster@@ ious wall .

the old man cro@@ o@@ ked his finger as though he were fir@@ ing a gun , and then he made las@@ er sounds .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
now , that is only a little bit hyper@@ bo@@ lic .
and everywhere the world is opening up , and it &apos;s a good thing .
i &apos;m not just an i@@ ch@@ th@@ y@@ ologist , i &apos;m a bon@@ a fi@@ de fish ner@@ d .
they didn &apos;t want to go to a com@@ ponenti@@ zed system .
so we res@@ yn@@ thesi@@ zed this song .
she said , &quot; all these people with eastern dres@@ s , walking up and down , very repe@@ ti@@ tive , very limited . &quot;
we looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their tran@@ sa@@ ctions in pla@@ in english .
the r@@ ca is really quite an amazing school from that vie@@ w@@ point .
now , in case the wea@@ ther changes before the laun@@ ch , they have to actually p@@ ack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mc@@ mur@@ do station .

the ti@@ tle of the book is , &quot; what the dor@@ mouse said : how the &apos; 60s counter@@ culture shaped the personal computer industry . &quot;
so i went off to the states , as many people do if they &apos;re going to do research , and i spent a few years in pittsburgh . this is pittsburgh .
i was vis@@ iting a cou@@ sin of mine in an old age home , and i spi@@ ed a very sha@@ ky old man making his way across the room on a wal@@ ker .
because it isn &apos;t what they do , it &apos;s who they are . they say , &quot; but this is me , you know .
and what &apos;s interesting about this view is , again , it &apos;s a view that &apos;s held by pro-@@ glob@@ ali@@ zers like tom frie@@ d@@ man , from whose book this quote is obviously ex@@ cer@@ p@@ ted , but it &apos;s also held by anti-@@ glob@@ ali@@ zers , who see this giant glob@@ alization tsunami that &apos;s about to w@@ re@@ ck all our lives if it hasn &apos;t already done so .
if dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be s@@ ma@@ sh@@ ing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neu@@ trin@@ os .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
so be really care@@ ful to try and avo@@ id the scre@@ w-@@ u@@ ps that can under@@ mine your brand .
as it did in spa@@ in .
so all these ste@@ ps in evolution are increas@@ ing , basically , the evolution of evol@@ v@@ ability .
so you can buy apps and make pur@@ ch@@ ases within those apps , but you think about amazon , you look at the trust bar@@ ome@@ ter that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments .
i wanted to live .
all over .
but after that , i decided to work on the spirit .
no hacker can break in and change your vote , because then it won &apos;t match your recei@@ pt .
so i came up with my own way to count cells in the brain , and it essentially consi@@ sts of dis@@ solving that brain into soup .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has redu@@ ced the problem for these women , not by changing the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
i asked them why .
the top is the ger@@ man .
i ble@@ w it up to the actual size , and i began using that , along with all the other reference that i had , compar@@ ing it to it as size reference for fig@@ uring out exactly how big the be@@ ak should be , exactly how long , etc .
again , that &apos;s one of the the@@ mes that i think has come through loud and clear in this conference is : where do we start ? how do we start ? what do we do to start ?
they want to teach me about my dest@@ iny .
bed net funding is up .
for example , molecular structure .
what would they tell us ?
so i thought , you know what , i &apos;m going to start with connection .
it de@@ pri@@ ves eu@@ than@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
we bur@@ y them in the ground .
he worked as an adv@@ oc@@ ate . he continued to play cri@@ cket .
and you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
they also have a slightly more ambi@@ gu@@ ous relationship with it .
now , if we look at this , and we stop for a minute , and we think about chi@@ ps today , we can &apos;t look inside a silicon chip . it &apos;s just so tiny .
looking back over his long career , architect mo@@ she saf@@ die del@@ ves into four of his design projects and expla@@ ins how he labor@@ ed to make each one truly unique for its site and its us@@ ers .
what does a typical place in the universe look like ?
she &apos;s got a big s@@ mile . she &apos;s got a big person@@ ality .
but one of the things that ex@@ posed me early to learning , and a tremendous curi@@ osity that was inst@@ ill@@ ed in me as a child , was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a vi@@ c@@ tro@@ la .
it &apos;s the only machine in the world that &apos;s actually done fusion .
now i &apos;m going to move on to another project i did .
and he said he &apos;d be deli@@ gh@@ ted . and i said -- and he said , &quot; would you like me to wear my dog c@@ oll@@ ar ? &quot;
the last third of the nin@@ e-@@ week intensive summer s@@ ession will be de@@ v@@ oted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so again , real easy to say that tyran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus on@@ to@@ gen@@ y inclu@@ ded nan@@ ot@@ y@@ ran@@ nu@@ s , and therefore we can take out another dinosau@@ r .
the numbers just make you want to zone out .
and this sequence shows the buil@@ du@@ p of that model .
but first , she said she &apos;s not interested .
it &apos;s em@@ bed@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
and then i was a mas@@ se@@ use . and then i was a landscape gar@@ den@@ er .
it &apos;s a very natural sense .
and in most information boxes , there &apos;s data .
and we try to guess what they &apos;re doing from their behavior on the surface .
and then war and chaos des@@ c@@ end .
what we &apos;ve done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university .
here &apos;s what this system is going to look like that we are fund@@ ed to build at this point .
you got@@ ta be accurate ! there &apos;s measu@@ re@@ ment involved , incre@@ ments .
i &apos;m a g@@ am@@ er , so i like to have goals .
the engineers had a really good idea .

talk about a picture of compassion .
you can also do this with solar cells .
this is european space agency mars express , image of a cr@@ ater on mars and in the middle of the cr@@ ater we have li@@ qu@@ id water , we have ice .
why don &apos;t you sit down with kids and give them four it@@ em@@ s , a red shir@@ t , a blue t@@ ie , a kan@@ g@@ aro@@ o and a laptop , and have them tell a story about those four things ?
so , the bottom line is that almost all research using sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles has taken place well below 500 feet .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
but he had a gi@@ ft .
in africa there were countries fighting for their indepen@@ dence : gu@@ ine@@ a , gu@@ ine@@ a-@@ bis@@ sa@@ u , ang@@ ola .

the other explanation is that the person does have the disease -- that &apos;s unlikely -- but the test gets it right , which is likely .

&quot; all right . well , what do you want to write ? what do you want to write about ? &quot;

in spi@@ te of pe@@ pf@@ ar , the gener@@ ous pe@@ pf@@ ar , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .

it &apos;s not only to de@@ fend the chinese regime from over@@ se@@ as , from the universal values , but also to prevent china &apos;s own citizens to access the global free internet , and even separate themselves into blo@@ cks , not united .

peter m@@ oly@@ neu@@ x : meet mil@@ o , the virtual boy
and then she turned to me and said , &quot; and you know what those young ac@@ tors did ?
and there &apos;s more and more people on the way . right ?
since i &apos;m hom@@ e-@@ scho@@ ol@@ ed , i went to go hear him speak one day .
and so we were very happy , th@@ us far .
but first we have to know .
so certainly , the physi@@ cians of today , including myself , are completely reli@@ able on these devices .
designer john ma@@ eda talks about his path from a seattle to@@ f@@ u fac@@ tory to the r@@ ho@@ de island school of design , where he became president in 2008 . ma@@ eda , a ti@@ rel@@ ess experiment@@ er and a wi@@ tty obser@@ ver , explor@@ es the cru@@ cial moment when design met computers .
but even if you to@@ ss a few numbers around , you &apos;re probably talking of an effective population of about 20,000 animals .
we &apos;re talking about books on hy@@ per ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric par@@ tial differenti@@ al equ@@ ations .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
this , again , is life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy .
it spre@@ ads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time cor@@ r@@ all@@ ing it .
what happened to willi@@ am je@@ ffer@@ son clin@@ ton ?
now , i mean , this sounds like a good theory , but i could talk for a long time and tell you lots of things , and they may be true , a por@@ tion of them , but i think it &apos;s better if i tried to show that to you here live .
and most often we can do two inter@@ ventions , fix the me@@ ds mix .
so what are they ?
how much money do you spend , in your life , in a super@@ market ?
it &apos;s so dark that if you were to be looking at the near@@ est star to you , and that star were to explo@@ de as a super@@ no@@ va , and you were to be star@@ ing directly at it at the moment when its light reached you , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to see even a gli@@ mmer .
this is the space@@ craft taking nine months to get to mars .
two : those i@@ f-@@ then re@@ wards often destroy crea@@ tivity .
and the journey , i believe , is a metaph@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys .
and they even talked about feeling happ@@ ier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tac@@ kl@@ ing the t@@ ough@@ est challenge of their lives .
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it .
these gran@@ ts not only allowed less weal@@ thy men to condu@@ ct research , but they also encoura@@ ged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre@@ -@@ set question .
now in the laborat@@ ory , if you take a cla@@ m and you put it in the ph that is -- not 8@@ .@@ 1 , which is the normal ph of se@@ a@@ water -- but 7@@ .@@ 5 , it dis@@ sol@@ ves in about three days .
can you you believe that ?
this is a he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous community .
i was a young reporter . i had just come out of college .
and to understand why , we must look at how , through the ages , military technologies have main@@ ta@@ ined or destro@@ yed world peace .
i &apos;m going to read a few stri@@ ps .
which was he ?
and when that cell@@ ular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly char@@ ged proteins and al@@ ig@@ ns them .
of course , when the motor vehicle was invented , and it became almost ubi@@ quit@@ ous by 192@@ 9 , that agri@@ cultural land could be used for human consumption or for ex@@ port .
and in fact , we can use data from all kinds of sour@@ ces no@@ wadays &#91; to do this &#93; .
jo@@ se@@ ph bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accoun@@ ts .
and she said , &quot; you know what ?
and every single one of them has been plac@@ ed .
the age is 400 years .
and i think it was best wit@@ n@@ essed when thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today .
but it too is being thre@@ at@@ ened by the massive amount of water being dra@@ wn from the ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca , which fe@@ eds these wet@@ lands , and also the incredible toxic bur@@ den of the largest toxic un@@ lin@@ ed im@@ po@@ und@@ ments on the planet , which are lea@@ ching in to the food chain for all the species down@@ stream .
and of course , they &apos;re not always cr@@ ying and scre@@ am@@ ing , but with three bo@@ ys , there &apos;s a de@@ cent prob@@ ability that at least one of them will not be com@@ porting himself exactly as he should .
this is a tra@@ gic example of ar@@ re@@ sted development , or a bud@@ ding green revolution stopped in its tra@@ cks .
five people jump@@ ed and died , other people were killed by the smo@@ ke .
you know , about a million years ago , a bunch of mon@@ keys fell out of trees , got a little clever , har@@ n@@ essed fire , invented the printing press , made , you know , lu@@ g@@ ga@@ ge with whe@@ els on it .
the digital world can@@ ni@@ b@@ ali@@ zes time , and in doing so , i want to suggest that what it thre@@ at@@ ens is the comple@@ ten@@ ess of ourselves .
in fact , they live in a 12@@ -@@ dimensional space .
ri@@ ck sm@@ ol@@ an : the story of a girl
and so the board meetings have been fascinating .
you &apos;ll be surprised at how fres@@ h air drives fres@@ h thinking , thank you .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it was@@ hed away the building &apos;s resi@@ dent micro@@ bi@@ al landscape .
and then a@@ chil@@ les takes the body of he@@ ctor , he hands it very ten@@ derly to the father , and the two men look at each other , and see each other as di@@ v@@ ine .
my father was edu@@ cated in cor@@ k , in the university of cor@@ k , in the &apos; 50s .
one hundred thir@@ t@@ y-@@ four com@@ mis@@ sions and se@@ mi@@ -@@ autonom@@ ous government bodies , all of which have dire@@ ctors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addres@@ sed to mr. bon@@ o . in his work , he may help us on this .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
so , for example , a group of young activi@@ sts in egyp@@ t try to form a party known as the center party , which adv@@ oc@@ ated the com@@ pati@@ bility of islam and democracy .
and if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life , you need to look at your shape . what am i wired to do ?
there is not a butt@@ on to push to do y@@ ard work or house work .
the engine is the sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d .
when that ice mel@@ ts , sea level ris@@ es by six meters .
now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
we then came to northern jordan , to jer@@ us@@ alem , which is all about abraham , to be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em , and finally to the place where he &apos;s bu@@ ried in he@@ br@@ on .
because it looks like those terrible ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic dom@@ es of my late belo@@ ved &apos; 60s , they &apos;re called &quot; bu@@ ck@@ y@@ ball@@ s . &quot;
most people ignore them or are fri@@ ghten@@ ed of them .
i feel as@@ ha@@ med .
he &apos;s been hon@@ ored with a statue now .
witness .
but by giving project teams and the cli@@ ents who they &apos;re working with permission to think with their hands , quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execu@@ tion much more easily .
we &apos;re going to go through a whole long list , your crea@@ tivity , and thinking of exc@@ uses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career .
our community des@@ er@@ ved a new way of doing things .
and so what i &apos;d suggest is what i call independent service auth@@ orities .
and if you bring them in for inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps in your companies , the thing about the autism , as@@ per@@ ger@@ -@@ y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . don &apos;t just say , &quot; design new software . &quot;
and it all started one day on a plane , on my way to ted , seven years ago .
and the longer you could interact with one of these inter@@ ventions , well that &apos;s indi@@ ca@@ tive , poten@@ tially , of lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term success .
the ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment of ci@@ vi@@ c virtu@@ e is ti@@ ed to the uses of intelle@@ ct and imagination at their most challenging .
you were focused on your hand . that &apos;s why you were distra@@ cted .
we went back and looked at where these particular tex@@ ts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the indu@@ s valley .
this is from some guy named ted .
is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say , we &apos;ve got to fix this problem and we can do it , i &apos;ve got all these billions of dollars , you know , da , da , da -- here &apos;s the big idea . and kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a m@@ ess of it . do you worry about that ?
because as i started to say , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re given money or f@@ ame for your own ego , ever .
time perspective is the study of how individuals , all of us , divi@@ de the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categ@@ ories .
because if you look at something in different wa@@ ve@@ b@@ ands of light , you see different things .
so there is a store in the u.s. called i@@ ke@@ a .
a year ago i was in tun@@ is , and i met the ima@@ m of a very small mosqu@@ e , an old man .
yeah .
i was lau@@ gh@@ ing so hard and so emotional that my mas@@ k was f@@ loo@@ ding , because i was cr@@ ying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
over the years , my faith in the power of story@@ telling has been tested .
okay , we have par@@ ach@@ ute al@@ ig@@ ned .
i &apos;ll show you just a couple others . here we have the numbers one through 10 , the dig@@ its zero through nine , actually .
chris far@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
we can make products that are beautiful or u@@ gly , sustainable or un@@ sustainable , aff@@ ord@@ able or expensive , func@@ tional or u@@ sel@@ ess .
we sort the plastic frag@@ ments into different size clas@@ ses , from five milli@@ meters to one-@@ third of a milli@@ meter .
but we have pa@@ dding , and fantastic sho@@ ck@@ -@@ absor@@ bing things like sor@@ bo@@ than@@ e -- the materials that help us , when we &apos;re hit like this , not to hurt ourselves too much .
ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in + lar@@ ry page : the gen@@ esis of google
so , we have actually -- are looking to turn the x prize into a worl@@ d-@@ class prize institute .
you look at some other scientific revolu@@ tions , and this case , i &apos;m talking about the solar system , that &apos;s c@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus , darwin &apos;s evolution , and te@@ ct@@ on@@ ic plates , that &apos;s we@@ gener .
this piece , actually , will be on display down in the sierra si@@ mul@@ cast lo@@ un@@ ge in the brea@@ ks between now and the end of the show .
it has the same conditions as a human body , 37 degre@@ es c@@ enti@@ grade , 95 percent oxygen .
there actually is something here , but it &apos;s de@@ gra@@ ded .
she lived to a hundred , even then . all along it was the sa@@ dness , the squ@@ al@@ or , but i never , until now loved her again .
so those are great .
it doesn &apos;t respond to antibio@@ tics . so i don &apos;t like it .
the amount of a moder@@ at@@ e-@@ to-@@ sever@@ e snow mel@@ ting of an area equivalent to the size of california .
i don &apos;t really even know what ja@@ ke is talking about after that , but you notice that he &apos;s changing the top@@ ic .
&quot; it &apos;s a bac@@ chan@@ al by ti@@ ti@@ an . &quot;
in the united states , we have -- everybody needs a banking service , but very few of us are trying to buy a bank .
you &apos;re trying to manage these , and this grid is available here , and we want to understand it .
in particular , there is growing dou@@ bt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be vie@@ wed as a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ te for economic growth .
but how would you speci@@ alize ?
so , the examples that i gave you are these is@@ lands of mes@@ h networks , and networks are interesting only as they are big .
the second fal@@ se pre@@ mis@@ e that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that car@@ es about its people , ser@@ ves the interests of the people , and repres@@ ents the people .
if we extra@@ po@@ late back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
on the right , also , we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going .
that &apos;s not only in the developing world .
when you eat a big fat@@ ty meal , how do you feel ?
it turns out that , whenever you have that system , weird stuff happens , and you in los angeles probably know this better than anyone .
these vi@@ bri@@ os , these bacteria , can actually infe@@ ct people .
but the up@@ shot of this is that the mission i want psych@@ ology to have , in addition to its mission of cur@@ ing the ment@@ ally ill , and in addition to its mission of making miser@@ able people less miser@@ able , is can psych@@ ology actually make people happ@@ ier ?
this would be a normal wave pattern .
i was myself pre@@ g@@ nant while i was doing the research for the book .
on either side of us are moun@@ tain ran@@ ges that are higher than the al@@ ps , so the setting here is very dra@@ matic .
what does that mean ?
but what he said was really significant , is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product , how we were going to make it low cost , robust .
so there &apos;s about 1@@ 30 million books that have been written since the da@@ wn of time .
china &apos;s not going to re@@ place the u.s. on this military board .
so the books are in english , the journ@@ als are done in english , but that is a self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling prophe@@ cy .
what are we doing with all the p@@ its of those nuclear wea@@ po@@ ns ?
so i would like to in@@ vi@@ te you from whatever industry you &apos;re from to join us in rein@@ v@@ ent@@ ing and rei@@ mag@@ ining the world , how things come together from the nano@@ scale to the human scale , so that we can go from a world like this to a world that &apos;s more like this .
the tool sty@@ les don &apos;t change that much .
yes , point five , ok , ok , ok ! i &apos;m a designer , that &apos;s all , of christmas gif@@ ts .
this is one piece of good news .
she changed her name to vi@@ vian because she wanted to fit in here in america .
she has six years to live .
we &apos;ve talked about mo@@ bility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
how much li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck do you need to produce this ?
i don &apos;t really think of myself as a designer , i don &apos;t really think of myself necessarily as a fashi@@ on designer .
how many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
why don &apos;t i just start by fir@@ ing away with the video ?
and -- you see the picture at the bottom ?
and i said , &quot; what ? &quot; and she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to get depres@@ sed . &quot;
winter is like magic . it &apos;s a time of change , when war@@ m@@ th turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappe@@ ars .
and if you give both of them cu@@ cum@@ ber for the task , the two mon@@ keys si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , they &apos;re perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row .
and this is what happens without a partner , when there &apos;s no partner sitting there .
at the other end of the scale , the game far@@ m@@ ville that you may well have heard of , has 70 million pla@@ yers around the world and most of these pla@@ yers are playing it almost every day .
so , in conclusion , i &apos;m going to show you an anima@@ tion that basically shows you how these or@@ bits have been moving , in three dimensions .
i mean that simpli@@ city sky .
this le@@ ver@@ ages millions of years of evolution by re@@ designing bu@@ gs to make really useful products .
so i want you to rei@@ mag@@ ine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
they allowed for no ob@@ stac@@ les .
i don &apos;t want to write for this public audience .
mr. smo@@ key je@@ ffer@@ son , let &apos;s take it for a walk . come on , baby .
now , you &apos;ve heard about this in terms of nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology .
and we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and child@@ like with them .
and you can see how many people it is .
but the process is very expensive and it &apos;s co@@ st-@@ pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tive for many countries around the glo@@ be .
right ?
they &apos;re looking for somewhere to bre@@ ed . if it ra@@ ins here they &apos;ll bre@@ ed .
you can come back to earth .
har@@ dy &apos;s ideas and darwin &apos;s ideas will be bl@@ ended together .
we were all suffering .
ger@@ on@@ im@@ o used to say that , &quot; my only friends are my legs . i only trust my legs . &quot;
so that &apos;s what it is all about .
mil@@ o : what do they want to come here for anyway ?
so you bur@@ n off the ha@@ agen@@ -@@ da@@ z@@ s from the night before ?
and in the middle of the recor@@ ding , the mi@@ cs pick this up , but later in the recor@@ ding , this kid shows up , and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advan@@ ced tricks on something called the t@@ all ra@@ il .
so we have the pe@@ ers that are provi@@ ding the services and the product , and the company that &apos;s doing the stuff that companies do .
you know , there is a -- i &apos;m always being asked what inspired me to em@@ bar@@ k on all this .
he insi@@ sted , &quot; i must go . &quot;
and you &apos;ve got trilli@@ ons of them .
so we &apos;re creating our own archi@@ ves and so on .
once i was in new york and got in a ca@@ b . i took the back@@ seat , and in front of me i saw something related to a play .
so that &apos;s the design for manufac@@ ture question .
and i want you to hold it there , just for a moment , and i only want you to allow your hand to sin@@ k and dri@@ ft and flo@@ at back to the tab@@ le@@ top at the same rate and speed as you dri@@ ft and flo@@ at into this rel@@ ax@@ ed state of awareness , and allow it to go all the way down to the tab@@ le@@ top .
he liked to take things apart .
i wit@@ n@@ essed the technical diffic@@ ul@@ ty .
and now we come to my problem .
and all the eastern religi@@ ons except japan had the same level .
and there &apos;s about 1@@ 30 million people in migra@@ tion trying to get into urban cen@@ ters at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expe@@ cting another 400 to 500 million people to migra@@ te into the urban cen@@ ters like shanghai and the manufactur@@ ing cen@@ ters .
i &apos;m wearing a hat . i &apos;m wearing a scar@@ f .
if you have any dou@@ b@@ ts about how technology affe@@ cts our lives , you just have to go to any major city .
we &apos;re going to give you one as your prize to take home .
we &apos;re spending 10 billion dollars on the cen@@ sus .
al-@@ qaeda is taking over our terri@@ tor@@ ies .
so i know at ted you &apos;re supposed to have a chan@@ ge-@@ the-@@ world kind of thing .
it &apos;s a poly@@ mathematical website .
what i &apos;m going to do is open up a website that i wrote .
climb again over the course of 24 hours .
they &apos;re probably having , at the very least , a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c spa@@ w@@ ning season this year .
thank you .
it gets worse .
what do you do ?
now , this isn &apos;t going to be fre@@ ak@@ y .
you see increasingly that the world now looks actually , for us europe@@ ans , much more like europe in the 19@@ th century .
but in fact , if you re@@ ver@@ sed the figure ground -- in other words , the dark areas here -- i for@@ got to ask for a poin@@ ter -- but if you re@@ verse it , you &apos;ll see a whole series of little dol@@ ph@@ ins . by the way , if you &apos;re also a student at cal@@ tech -- they also tend to just see the dol@@ ph@@ ins . it &apos;s based on experience .
so , here &apos;s my friend paul .
that is the final , and i think most beautiful less@@ on , of howard mo@@ sko@@ witz : that in embra@@ cing the diversity of human beings , we will find a sur@@ er way to true happiness .
his father was a blog@@ ger .
i got popular , but i was sc@@ ared i &apos;d get cau@@ ght again .
i &apos;d broken my ne@@ ck and my back in six places .
but this wasn &apos;t always the way .
this man is wearing what we call a bee be@@ ard .
the office building is basically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te for doing private work .
and this is the situation you see .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ eline .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facili@@ tat@@ ing that process of heal@@ ing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the bur@@ den of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their re@@ co@@ very .
and for those of you who love the arts , aren &apos;t you gla@@ d you inv@@ ited me here to bri@@ gh@@ ten your day ?
we want them to be free of that .
it &apos;s for this reason that the global com@@ mission on hiv and the law , of which i &apos;m a me@@ mber , was estab@@ li@@ shed by the agen@@ cies of the united nations -- to look at the ways that legal environ@@ ments are affe@@ cting people living with hiv and those at greatest risk , and to re@@ com@@ mend what should be done to make the law an ally , not an enemy , of the global response to hiv .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
e@@ ye@@ bur@@ n : this is what happens to the people in mi@@ ami who are looking up .
we knew they worked through ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned trial and error .
the fact is , we don &apos;t know .
how do you design that no@@ zz@@ le ?
contemporary cour@@ t cases often conc@@ ern an alle@@ ge@@ dly new version of crea@@ tion@@ ism , called &quot; intelligent design , &quot; or id .
and so , i was able to put that into this story , which is an alphabet , and hopefully go on to something else .
i was like -- so , the idea that we create this fal@@ se -- this sense of com@@ plac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice ver@@ sa .
one is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of -- which most of us , all of us , here in this room do -- research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually el@@ ev@@ ate your level of happiness .
and it inclu@@ des some fis@@ hes as well .
travel can be liber@@ ating , but when it is in@@ cess@@ ant , we become permanent ex@@ il@@ es without re@@ pose .
so , i said , &quot; okay well we can &apos;t do that . then we can do something harder . &quot;
in the old days , it was a kni@@ fe and a gun .
and then , finally , a progra@@ mmer that will set the level of the stimu@@ lation , which is the level which says you are having a heart attack .
i hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survi@@ ves us , and the stress created in families by dying is enormous , and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else , so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you &apos;ve got a choice .
and then if you have something you like , you can down@@ lo@@ ad it onto your robot and ex@@ ec@@ ute it in real life , run the program in real life .
so for example , this s@@ ally person says , &quot; so i need to find people to ch@@ ill with &quot; and ja@@ ke says , &quot; haha &quot; -- you could write a dis@@ ser@@ tation about &quot; haha &quot; too , but we don &apos;t have time for that — &quot; haha so you &apos;re going by yourself ? why ? &quot;
the wa@@ y@@ ne coun@@ ty child wel@@ f@@ are protection agency said no .
you can see the sky@@ di@@ ver with the red suit , he &apos;s in a stand@@ -@@ up position .
so ere@@ z and i followed the fa@@ te of over 100 ir@@ reg@@ ular verb@@ s through 12 centuries of english language , and we saw that there &apos;s actually a very simple mathematical pattern that cap@@ tures this complex histor@@ ical change , nam@@ ely , if a ver@@ b is 100 times more frequ@@ ent than another , it regul@@ ari@@ zes 10 times slo@@ wer .
but the stage is crow@@ ded .
the spli@@ t starts to emer@@ ge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to sc@@ are them , like the u.s. sub@@ marine community , which wat@@ ches the so@@ vi@@ et na@@ vy disappe@@ ar over@@ night .
she used to work for the telephone exchange , and she used to actually over@@ hear conver@@ sations between ne@@ hr@@ u and ed@@ win@@ a moun@@ t@@ bat@@ ten .
over here , tom@@ my &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
they were all holding their photo as a statement .
that means that they can be students , young parents , and be able to sort of du@@ ck and di@@ ve around the bas@@ ics of co@@ o@@ king , no matter what re@@ c@@ ession h@@ its them next time . if you can co@@ ok , re@@ c@@ ession money doesn &apos;t matter .
o@@ bes@@ ity costs you americans 10 percent of your healthcare bil@@ ls , 150 billion dollars a year .
and if you try that , i think you &apos;ll find that you agree .
so you might be thinking , the wave bubble sounds great .
you don &apos;t want to say , &quot; well , yeah , i can kind of understand how a human being in those cir@@ cum@@ stances would hate the country i live in . &quot; that &apos;s not a pleas@@ ant thing , but i think it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to get used to and work on . now , i want to stress that to understand , you know -- there are people who don &apos;t like this whole business of understanding the gras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots , the root caus@@ es of things ; they don &apos;t want to know why people hate us . i want to understand it .
you have to say , &quot; sam din@@ ed , &quot; not , &quot; sam din@@ ed the pizza . &quot;
i &apos;ll give you some examples .
and when i see that tun@@ a -- this is my favorite view -- i begin to wonder : how did this fish solve the lon@@ g@@ itu@@ de problem before we did ?
thanks . thank you .
so again , what we focus on is pre@@ vention rather than treatment , at first rate .
and it works the ex@@ act same way .
we &apos;re all pretty much the same .
it &apos;s really horri@@ ble .
just wi@@ re the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and appar@@ ently they do .
and once again , a myster@@ y wra@@ pped inside of a myster@@ y -- perhaps the key to der@@ ar@@ tu tu@@ l@@ u and the tarahumara is wra@@ pped in three other myster@@ ies , which go like this : three things -- if you have the answer , come up and take the micro@@ phone , because nobody else knows the answer .
what happened was the bac@@ teri@@ ci@@ de was formul@@ ated with minute tra@@ ces of tin .
there &apos;s one fellow out there , van pra@@ ag@@ h is his name , james van pra@@ ag@@ h .
it &apos;s not about some being with a high con@@ science and some others having not a con@@ science .
imagine a dance piece for the first in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into something that even today kill@@ s thousands of women .
and the most deva@@ stat@@ ing in@@ jury is ob@@ st@@ et@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ul@@ a .
i then got this email from youtube weir@@ dly noti@@ fying me that there was content in that ow@@ ned by the myster@@ ious w@@ m@@ g that mat@@ ched their content id .
that &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the auto@@ matic way of thinking .
hon@@ ey , sit up so they can see you . &quot;
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private prof@@ its , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conser@@ vation makes more sense , and not destruction .
he &apos;d had cat@@ ar@@ act surgery .
and that is that iran will achieve that nation@@ alist pri@@ de by making enough wea@@ pon@@ s-@@ grade fuel , through research , so that they could show that they know how to make wea@@ pon@@ s-@@ grade fuel , but not enough to actually build a bom@@ b .
so what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospit@@ als have to order fuel oil .
this little boy will never step outside of the sa@@ cre@@ d fields that surro@@ und the men &apos;s hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
they told her she couldn &apos;t love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing .
you can try to manipu@@ late your fa@@ te , like this person is doing , but it costs you something to do it .
what that says basically is that the general ten@@ den@@ cy of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order , lack of structure -- in fact , to mus@@ h .
because this has also been a dra@@ matic time of transformation .
you want to see the classic swe@@ at@@ shop , meet me at ma@@ dison square garden , i &apos;ll take you down the street , and i &apos;ll show you a chinese swe@@ at@@ shop .
and they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to , in the case of the ge@@ bu@@ s@@ i , only a 15 percent chance . the tiny , little blue bar in the lower le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand corner pl@@ ots the cor@@ respon@@ ding stati@@ stic from united states and europe in the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century , and inclu@@ des all the deaths of both world wars . if the death rate in tri@@ b@@ al war@@ f@@ are had pre@@ vail@@ ed during the 20th century , there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million .
growth of six percent a year . absolutely incredible .
and i &apos;m telling you , this is very robust across english tex@@ ts .
and if you go there , you say , &quot; hey , everybody &apos;s really healthy . &quot;
we were pe@@ er-@@ learning , we were engineering , we were making things , prototyp@@ ing , but most importantly we were trying our prototyp@@ es in the water as often as possible , to fa@@ il as quickly as possible , to learn from .
ads for coca-cola and be@@ er always de@@ pic@@ t s@@ mil@@ ing young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca-cola and be@@ er .
we stop for a drink of water .
despite having a research estab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment that is the en@@ vy of the world , more than half of the american public don &apos;t believe in evolution .
the cost has come down by half every year .
he wrote that , &quot; it &apos;s hardly an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that the ti@@ p of the radi@@ cal acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot;
ser@@ i@@ ously , if you have a cal@@ cul@@ ator with you , raise your hand , raise your hand .
and they make everyone of those bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to swe@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tured , they will not di@@ vul@@ ge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy , because it &apos;s imper@@ ative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essen@@ tial piece of technology .
so we thought , okay , we &apos;re going to try to get out and get some sli@@ me .
and just look inside large organi@@ zations and you &apos;ll see why that is so .
when you give people specific information about their health , where they stand , and where they want to get to , where they might get to , that path , that notion of a path -- that ten@@ ds to work for behavior change .
and by that , what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we &apos;re talking about now is really simple .
see the bri@@ ck walls as all the problems that we &apos;ve in@@ fli@@ cted on this planet .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
and later i can find a wall , anywhere , and start brow@@ sing those photos or maybe , &quot; ok , i want to modi@@ fy this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend . &quot;
and we went in , and right off the bat , our conversation really wasn &apos;t taking flight , but he was or@@ dering a lot of food .
people like me , on the other hand , rock the boat .
and with that call , my life would change forever .
so , my friend gene fle@@ w over with his son , tim .
fortunately , i didn &apos;t have to look very far .
so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books .
199@@ 6 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 200@@ 6 : over five million .
give it away . share it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power . give it to them because they can do it in private .
i would give the boy probably about 30 seconds , which means , by the time he got to me , i was already saying things like , &quot; why are you cr@@ ying ?
and the answer from the ne@@ pal@@ i team who is working at the minute would say , don &apos;t be ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have three million more toi@@ lets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim .
next , this is by thomas swi@@ ft@@ on .
we heard over the last couple days what an ur@@ gent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pres@@ sing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
so , examples like chri@@ stop@@ her wr@@ en &apos;s king &apos;s cross : you can see that the structural forces of the v@@ au@@ l@@ ting get artic@@ ul@@ ated as lines , so you &apos;re really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
this is not big news to vi@@ tic@@ ul@@ turi@@ sts ; they have been , you know , concern@@ ed with water and ferti@@ li@@ zation .
and a professor in the university of massa@@ ch@@ usetts , in the zo@@ ology department , bought this cli@@ mber because she wanted to study the inse@@ ct diversity of the top of the tree can@@ op@@ y .
there was someone recently , wasn &apos;t there ? just a couple weeks ago .
we have a mission statement for our company doing migra@@ ine , which is , &quot; prevent or am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate migra@@ ine hea@@ da@@ ches by the app@@ lication of a safe , controll@@ ed magnetic pulse app@@ lied , as needed , by the patient . &quot;
how do you think of where co@@ sm@@ ology is now , in a sort of histor@@ ical side ?
and this was one issue : to build it that li@@ ght@@ weight that no one would be hurt if it fell down .
this could be even more powerful if you look at ma@@ mm@@ als that are doing things slightly differently .
they have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutri@@ ents and water .
it &apos;s wonderful . do you know what the world will be sa@@ ved by ?
here is a dna origami re@@ ct@@ angle , and here are some ti@@ les growing from it .
this is five dangerous things .
well , it condu@@ cts electricity .
the first one has to do with making sound visible .
this is all i have . i have a couple of facts about somebody .
these huge cre@@ v@@ as@@ ses open up .
but the point is , and the point was that every day of our lives is ep@@ ic , and i &apos;ll tell you , when i walked up onto that beach , st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed up onto that beach , and i had so many times in a very pu@@ ff@@ ed up ego way , re@@ he@@ ar@@ sed what i would say on the beach .
now , i tell you all of this not to convince you that it &apos;s great that open-@@ source programm@@ ers now have a tool that suppor@@ ts their philosop@@ hi@@ cal way of working , although i think that is great .
ace of diam@@ on@@ ds .
the brain is inten@@ tionally -- by the way , there &apos;s a sha@@ ft of ner@@ ves that jo@@ ins the two hal@@ ves of the brain called the cor@@ pus c@@ allo@@ sum . it &apos;s th@@ i@@ cker in women .
in 2004 , i started particip@@ ant produ@@ ctions and we had a really good first year , and no call .
there &apos;s not a formul@@ a .
the second thing is , they build a culture .
i &apos;ll tell you what to do with your fing@@ ers , same thing .
at these lar@@ ge-@@ scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft camp where workers live during the entire building process .
why do i care if you get in at nine o &apos;@@ clock ?
paul mac@@ cre@@ ad@@ y : nature v@@ s. humans
the ones with the highest income , the better off -- i wouldn &apos;t say rich -- they have higher hiv .
and we get within about the same price as current electricity .
well , what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets , the co@@ verage rate really falls down a lot .
people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of die@@ ter ra@@ ms , and the objects that he would create for the company called brau@@ n .
and he pre@@ vi@@ ously was a super@@ inten@@ dent in char@@ le@@ ston , south car@@ ol@@ ina and then in den@@ ver , color@@ a@@ do .
if there &apos;s more pat@@ roll@@ ing to do -- so i created a distur@@ b@@ ance , so extra pat@@ roll@@ ers were needed -- the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers will switch to pat@@ ro@@ l .
and when i went to one of the clu@@ b@@ houses a couple years ago , i saw a 13@@ -year-old boy who was using our sc@@ rat@@ ch software to create a game somewhat like this one , and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game , but also he wanted to do more .
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive .
it &apos;s not just a conser@@ vation in for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ de of dead forms .
and so , there &apos;s one thing that makes me pur@@ sue my understanding of human nature , and this re@@ minds me of it .
but very , very few people or organi@@ zations know why they do what they do .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
and actually , this morning , i got an email saying that we &apos;ve just finished , today , building the last piece of at@@ las .
and there he is , with this horri@@ ble electrical box on his ru@@ mp in this fantastic , decre@@ p@@ it pal@@ ace .
it &apos;s very simple : po@@ ur it from an expensive bottle .
but it is a set of values that cannot , in my view , be ex@@ t@@ ingu@@ ished .
i think in absolute terms , last year we ear@@ ned about 20@@ -@@ odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent e@@ bit@@ a .
the paraly@@ mp@@ ics , just for a little bit of cl@@ ari@@ fication , are the olymp@@ ics for people with physical dis@@ abilities -- am@@ pu@@ te@@ es , person@@ s with cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l pal@@ sy , and wheelchair ath@@ le@@ tes -- as opposed to the special olymp@@ ics , which de@@ als with people with mental dis@@ abilities .
it &apos;s going to be about thinking about how it evol@@ ves , and how people respond to it .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 con@@ cer@@ ts a day .
you don &apos;t need something more to explain something more .
and it &apos;s been very exciting .
you can see it at a gross level in the world of d@@ ating .
and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to p@@ and@@ ora to see them .
we &apos;re going to have a department of something else between war and peace .
we know that cir@@ cum@@ c@@ ision redu@@ ces hiv infe@@ ction by 60 percent in men .
is it the ex@@ pos@@ ure ? we have profess@@ ors from mit , berk@@ ele@@ y , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formul@@ as , experiments , much beyond the class@@ room .
we &apos;re 3,000 strong right now .
however , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you recei@@ ve over@@ all .
and it does it in such a way that it doesn &apos;t get bitten itself .
at 6@@ 7 percent oxygen sat@@ u@@ ration , the normal is about 9@@ 7 .
susan sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh : the gent@@ le geni@@ us of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s
but the current ro@@ vers cannot get there .
so when you learn through co@@ ding , and co@@ ding to learn , you &apos;re learning it in a meaningful context , and that &apos;s the best way of learning things .
it says kids over here , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about .
mihal@@ y c@@ si@@ ks@@ zent@@ mihal@@ y@@ i : flow , the secret to happiness
in fact , imagine something even worse .
so this was an opportunity . if they were asking me whether i loved them or not , then i mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t love them , which led me to the mi@@ ra@@ cle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to .
so think about a co@@ p .
google answers is something we started , which is really cool , which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there &apos;s a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you , and it &apos;s guaran@@ te@@ ed and all that , and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself .
susan : &quot; lo@@ l , i see it . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m not the only one whist@@ ling here .
we &apos;re taking calls live on stage here at ted in mon@@ ter@@ ey .
in the last three years , i &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the mi@@ d@@ st of an economic down@@ turn .
the columbia blo@@ ws up , suddenly there are a lot of sear@@ ches on columbia .
which is ro@@ oted in one-@@ life culture .
she pulled the car over ; she said , &quot; get out of the car . &quot;
because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
and no side of the political spectrum has a mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly on either of those qu@@ alities .
but it &apos;s not just chinese heroes he car@@ es about .
i think there &apos;s -- i don &apos;t know what data would im@@ press you , but how about , 4@@ 3 percent of the refin@@ ed fuel produced in the world is consum@@ ed by cars in me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan areas in the united states .
and you know what pir@@ ates really like ?
i mean , it &apos;s self-@@ awareness that separ@@ ates homo sa@@ pi@@ ens from earlier inst@@ an@@ ces of our man@@ kind .
the ven@@ d@@ or , say , had stolen cre@@ dit card details ; the pur@@ ch@@ aser wanted to get a hold of them .
and that was true until i got to college .
and so in 199@@ 7 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together .
so i was thinking about my own life , and how i &apos;d like to memor@@ i@@ alize my life , you know , for the ages , and also — — the lives of my friends , but the problem with this is that my friends aren &apos;t quite ke@@ en on the idea of me ta@@ xi@@ der@@ my@@ -@@ ing them .
we &apos;ll let those ro@@ am around the audi@@ tori@@ um a little bit .
and they &apos;re re@@ tali@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ proof .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 3@@ 60 million dollars profit per year .
we plant in the se@@ ed@@ l@@ ings mix@@ ed with the ban@@ anas , the pa@@ pa@@ y@@ as , all the cro@@ ps for the local people , but the trees are growing up fast in between as well .
we couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and sele@@ ct brain areas to do that same thing .
after i gradu@@ ated from the yale law school and got my first law job , my new haven analy@@ st , dr. white , announ@@ ced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months , several years before i had plan@@ ned to leave new haven .
so we stopped the ship , as you do .
and so , it was really those lessons that made me decide to build ac@@ u@@ men f@@ und about six years ago .
you can find spi@@ ders in nearly every ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al hab@@ it@@ at .
i was a young dri@@ ver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , i saw the bra@@ ke lights go on .
and i had a happy br@@ us@@ h with conver@@ gen@@ ce until , kind of , war@@ ner basically has to li@@ qui@@ date the whole thing .
and then you look at the out@@ puts and you start meas@@ uring what comes out .
so we might have a wild idea , but we &apos;re afraid to share it with anybody else .
and i would have lost my face .
you would literally hear the sound .
so first i started with the mind .
b@@ j : but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique foot@@ age .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accoun@@ t@@ ability often doesn &apos;t work .
a lot of people look up to me .
in fact , they might be du@@ e to the very nature of our evolutionary history .
two things .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ b@@ ase pair pieces we synthesi@@ zed were completely accurate and com@@ pati@@ ble with a life@@ -@@ forming sequence .
so here , all of a sudden , we &apos;re looking at a map of the human heart .
you know , a gentle@@ man was once watching a present@@ ation i was doing , when i was working with a young pi@@ an@@ ist .
this is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
very quickly : i wasn &apos;t quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the &quot; japanese es@@ says on i@@ d@@ len@@ ess &quot; which said it &apos;s nice to have something which is un@@ finished because it impli@@ es there is still room for growth .
like this .
our society lo@@ ves to roman@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the idea of the single , sol@@ o invent@@ or who , working late in the lab one night , makes an earth@@ sha@@ king discovery , and vo@@ il@@ a , over@@ night everything &apos;s changed .
and they said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s the internet . &quot;
so right now , i feel more like these are my principles , and if you don &apos;t like them , i have others .
the police , investig@@ ating offic@@ ers , were amaz@@ ingly efficient .
in june , the world health organization dec@@ lar@@ ed the first global flu pande@@ mic in 4@@ 1 years .
today , i &apos;m using it to create permanent , bil@@ lo@@ wing , vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous forms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buildings in cities around the world .
and so , we launched our own t@@ 20 leagu@@ e .
this is -- we have a fair@@ ly complex process that , you know , software and musi@@ cians and so on , but when we &apos;re all done , we know that the e@@ ar is the final arb@@ it@@ er .
and you know , val@@ ve -- you know , port@@ al -- is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we ac@@ qui@@ red the video games , what to do with violence .
you can walk up to your local school and consu@@ lt with the teachers . they &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
but actually i did .
that the co2 problem , the climate problem that we &apos;ve heard about , is driving lots of things -- innova@@ tions in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also , i think , in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , it will drive us towards thinking about climate and wea@@ ther control , whether we like it or not .
the cap@@ tain of a new ze@@ al@@ and ves@@ sel who was just down there is reporting a significant dec@@ line in the number of the ross sea kil@@ ler whales , who are directly depen@@ dent on the antar@@ c@@ tic to@@ o@@ th@@ fish as their main source of food .
so you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from china and india jo@@ ining in ?
i think it &apos;s a very dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we &apos;ll be going down the road in a sea of go@@ ssi@@ p .
but sometimes , that &apos;s not the case .
environmental problems , in many ways , put us all in the same boat .
when we used this gro@@ und@@ breaking e@@ e@@ g technology to actually look at ju@@ stin &apos;s brain , the results were star@@ tling .
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture : that &apos;s the 13@@ 0-@@ foot diam@@ e@@ ter library , that is exactly the size of the b@@ ase of the spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p .
they arri@@ ve first .
we &apos;d have a water treatment system treating waste@@ water , turning that into fres@@ h water and gener@@ ating energy from the soli@@ ds using just plants and micro@@ -@@ organisms .
if we can get rid of that , then the high@@ ways will now be useful to you , as contra@@ sted by what &apos;s happening in many parts of the world today .
so i find myself asking : where is music in all of this ?
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
this is when we see the birth of the trans@@ national arms organization al qaeda .
it &apos;s one of these rare cases where the u.s. is actually slightly better than &#91; the u.k. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice ver@@ sa .
and so these companies , they build off@@ ices .
and let &apos;s put it back into the de@@ ck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
we don &apos;t know the needs of the el@@ derly , the ment@@ ally ill .
now , i &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in total isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is -- that &apos;s another part of the story . come talk to me about it , we &apos;ll fill in some of the details -- but there &apos;s a very important message here : this is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been syste@@ matically de@@ car@@ bon@@ i@@ zing our energy system .
and it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classi@@ cal re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation paradigm , ste@@ pping on a tre@@ ad@@ mil@@ l , and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin volun@@ tary control over the leg .
however , recently this ris@@ d opportunity kind of aro@@ se -- going to ris@@ d -- and i couldn &apos;t re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this real easy , because the letters had told me , mit forever .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in compar@@ ison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is .
say , &quot; by the way , that guy &apos;s a cra@@ pp@@ y emplo@@ ye@@ e . &quot;
we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them .
and i told you earlier that we may want to emplo@@ y lots and lots of robots to over@@ come the limit@@ ations of size .
speed x 4 .
i hadn &apos;t even known that there were rain@@ forests in the east , but in great smo@@ ky mountains national park it can rain up to 100 in@@ ches of rain a year .
but i think that ei@@ le@@ en expres@@ ses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collabor@@ ation .
and i think some of you may have vis@@ ited -- these farmers are helped by ki@@ ck@@ start and tech@@ no@@ ser@@ ve , who help them become more self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent .
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone per@@ cei@@ ving it .
why do we struggle with it so much ?
one person win@@ s .
you know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by paul co@@ hen , the american histor@@ ian .
there are too many of us outside and everybody , just to bor@@ row a bit from hans -- hans rosling , he &apos;s my guy -- if the size of the text repres@@ ents what gets the most attention , it &apos;s the problems . but what we really need are african solutions that are appropri@@ ate for africa -- looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they &apos;ve got .
he was a broken bran@@ ch gra@@ fted onto a different family tree , adop@@ ted , not because his parents op@@ ted for a different dest@@ iny .
once upon a time , scar@@ let was used as ba@@ it in dog fi@@ ghts .
so , when i went to look at those fig@@ ures , i not@@ ed that since the late 196@@ 0s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states , never to come back .
it &apos;s worse than sil@@ ly -- it &apos;s really bad science .
because 1@@ 30 is the cu@@ tting line for gif@@ te@@ dness .
&quot; it &apos;s going to transform your organization . i don &apos;t want to tell you about it now , but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to tor@@ onto ? &quot; so i fle@@ w here , met down on front street east , and we sat in the boar@@ d@@ room , and i said , &quot; right , here &apos;s my vision of getting men growing mu@@ sta@@ ches all across canada raising awareness and fun@@ ds for your organization . &quot;
but you will re@@ main one of the most important super@@ power@@ s , and the most hop@@ eful super@@ power , for the time to be .
what you may not have realized is that english is actually an out@@ li@@ er .
i was completely wrong .
let me give you an example .
they make a lot of money .
there &apos;s no photo@@ shop here .
you &apos;re in these levels of in@@ fer@@ ior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or fig@@ ments , or frag@@ ment@@ ary fig@@ ments , all neur@@ ally en@@ co@@ ded in particular cells or small clu@@ sters of cells .
this is us ch@@ as@@ ing it in the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
but the wealth g@@ aps are growing wi@@ der .
em@@ manu@@ el ? absolutely .
okay . that &apos;s le@@ ster@@ land .
thank you .
when the astron@@ om@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be inf@@ using space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
i met s@@ ang@@ ha@@ mit@@ ra eight years ago when i was in ban@@ gal@@ ore organi@@ zing a work@@ shop with leaders of different n@@ go &apos;s working in some of the har@@ dest aspe@@ cts of society .
but i see that people are coming along , that the au@@ dien@@ ces , parado@@ x@@ ically , are much more respon@@ sive and much more understanding of this expan@@ sion of design than some of my colleagues are .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
gif@@ ted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
sometimes we just forget .
you don &apos;t even have to be je@@ wish .
there is am@@ ple opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them .
or problems to be sol@@ ved by emp@@ ty campaign promis@@ es of presi@@ dents come and gone .
thank you very much for your time .
however , if we parents are un@@ aware , we are leaving our children to fend for themselves .
i mean now we &apos;re hop@@ ing we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built city hall , attra@@ cted two hot@@ els .
and i got my way here being happ@@ ily proud that i couldn &apos;t see .
so we can see where it &apos;s emerging here , like president ford , iraq , bush . and we can actually isol@@ ate just the words -- i call them secre@@ ts -- and we can cause them to form an alphab@@ e@@ tical list . and we see an@@ na ni@@ col@@ e s@@ mit@@ h playing a big role recently .
it suppor@@ ts your ton@@ gue from behind .
and david said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor .
instead of doing that actually , we &apos;ve developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish .
h@@ our@@ ly simu@@ lations show that lar@@ gely or wh@@ olly ren@@ e@@ w@@ able gri@@ ds can deliver highly reli@@ able power when they &apos;re fore@@ ca@@ sted , inte@@ gr@@ ated and diversi@@ fied by both type and location .
but still they are producing a lot of scientific data .
this is an un@@ believ@@ able light show .
having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
here &apos;s the dirty secret of the air force , you can win by bom@@ bing .
so this pre@@ -@@ clinical study , i think , bo@@ des hope for the kinds of things we &apos;re hop@@ ing to do in the future .
we are late to watch &quot; afgh@@ an star . &quot;
and they also have to make a living , and people need to be f@@ ed .
but still , if you just took that data from that cr@@ ash to the fe@@ der@@ al government , and said , &quot; i have invented a new car seat .
and because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : we go into den@@ ial : &quot; it &apos;s not me , it has nothing to do with me , it &apos;s never going to happen to me . &quot;
thank you very much .
my wife doesn &apos;t need food -- she &apos;s a great train@@ er , much better than i am .
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a con@@ dom .
they become very ener@@ ge@@ tic , and able to find the resour@@ ce in the environment , similar to what we saw before .
and these are the so@@ -@@ called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
so what we did , we went to al@@ as@@ ka , which is where the gri@@ zz@@ lies rely on really high , almost in@@ ac@@ c@@ essi@@ ble , moun@@ tain slo@@ pes for their den@@ ning .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
if you want to make a dinosau@@ r , you go out , you find yourself a piece of pe@@ tri@@ fied tree sa@@ p -- other@@ wise known as am@@ ber -- that has some b@@ loo@@ d-@@ su@@ cking insects in it , good ones , and you get your inse@@ ct and you dri@@ ll into it and you su@@ ck out some dna , because obviously all insects that su@@ cked blood in those days su@@ cked dinosau@@ r dna out .
this is getting ready for the mon@@ soon in bom@@ bay , india .
as humans , we are social , we are empa@@ th@@ ic , and that &apos;s great .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to susta@@ in itself .
it &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tremendous sensory conflict .
there &apos;s another hu@@ b in london , now , and the rest are getting set up . we hope to give the data away at some stage . that &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
they beha@@ ved just like the children .
and yeah , all the clin@@ ici@@ ans in the audience will talk about power and all the standard de@@ vi@@ ation . we &apos;ll do that later .
we know that hea@@ ther , his sister hea@@ ther , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug hab@@ it .
e : happy birthday to you .
but in fact , it &apos;s phenomen@@ ally complicated to take a concept &quot; i &quot; and a concept &quot; tiger &quot; and bl@@ end them together .
this is a shop@@ ping thing .
consider , the single most successful international environmental effort of the 20th century , the mon@@ tre@@ al proto@@ co@@ l , in which the nations of earth band@@ ed together to protect the planet from the har@@ m@@ ful effects of o@@ z@@ one-@@ destro@@ ying chemicals used at that time in air condi@@ tion@@ ers , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators and other cool@@ ing devices .
and they would sing them only when they plan@@ ted the rice , as though they were see@@ ding the he@@ arts of the dead into the rice .
this is a young ch@@ im@@ p . the young ones are better than the old ones , just like humans .
i was so up@@ set .
my name is ur@@ sus wehr@@ l@@ i , and i would like to talk to you this morning about my project , ti@@ dying up art .
now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed .
and the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
and now you &apos;ve got to deliver .
the deep@@ er you go , the lo@@ op@@ ier you get .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the liter@@ ature that , you know , things like web@@ sites , collabor@@ ative environ@@ ments -- you &apos;ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it &apos;s always pil@@ oted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , bi@@ ases the result .
and i can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an ol@@ den@@ bur@@ g .
once you get to camp four , you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you &apos;re going to go for the sum@@ mit or not .
and on the very first day our coun@@ sel@@ or ga@@ ther@@ ed us all together and she taught us a che@@ er that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to inst@@ ill camp spirit .
so i &apos;ll show you the next movie .
now , it &apos;s interesting because there are 3@@ 0-@@ odd diseases that can be treated with vac@@ cin@@ es now , but we &apos;re still thre@@ at@@ ened by things like hiv and flu .
as a professor , i think i have the right to pro@@ pose something differently .
so with such large , li@@ ght@@ weight pil@@ lo@@ ws , we had much less steel .
it &apos;s caused by fast process@@ ing of toxic cas@@ sa@@ va root in fam@@ ine situation .
if you re@@ ward teachers for kids &apos; test sc@@ or@@ es , they stop car@@ ing about edu@@ c@@ ating and only care about test prepar@@ ation .
ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these sub@@ tle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consci@@ ously make themselves better sa@@ vers and more conscious investor@@ s in their own future .
it has admini@@ strat@@ ors in it and many , many other things .
so , basically the gas dis@@ sol@@ ves into our body .
and i &apos;m going to use as an example the internet , because it &apos;s a particularly good example of stac@@ ked simpli@@ city .
and tra@@ gi@@ cally in &#91; 2003 &#93; , a scientist was taken down and dro@@ w@@ ned , and she was being consum@@ ed by a le@@ op@@ ard se@@ al .
and they may be gone , but they &apos;re never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
jo@@ ann ku@@ cher@@ a-@@ mor@@ in : stun@@ ning data visu@@ alization in the allo@@ sphere
so i figured i needed to learn a little bit more about business , so i went to stanford business school and studied there .
what you &apos;ve heard is true .
he , like einstein , was in search of what we call a uni@@ fied theory .
and if there were , i would have remembered that one . &quot;
j@@ w : so is english man@@ ia good or bad ?
it &apos;s a film about may@@ a gre@@ tel , a famous cer@@ am@@ ic@@ ist , and a teacher at c@@ ran@@ bro@@ ok .
and you say , &quot; ok , but what is the name of this street ? &quot;
kb : james and our country dire@@ ctor in ghana , em@@ manu@@ el ot@@ o@@ o are now recei@@ ving reg@@ ular death thre@@ ats because the two of them managed to get convi@@ ctions and im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment for three human traff@@ i@@ ck@@ ers for the very first time in ghana for ens@@ la@@ ving people , from the fishing industry , for ens@@ la@@ ving children .
is it a link to on@@ co@@ gen@@ esis ? i don &apos;t know .
all we really need to do is look at this issue as the ur@@ gent , sha@@ me@@ ful issue that it is .
but , i mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq ?
who are these characters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
t@@ m : thank you , thank you .
and these are the ultimate liter@@ ali@@ sts .
so , emotion is it . and if we get the right emotion , we can get ourselves to do anything . we can get through it .
for what it &apos;s worth , sir isa@@ ac new@@ ton , the greatest scientist who ever lived , he thought jesus came to earth specifically to oper@@ ate the le@@ vers of gravity .
it &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
so a gi@@ ga@@ par@@ se@@ c is three billion light years -- that &apos;s the scale .
and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defen@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool .
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
here &apos;s a time lap@@ se of one of the ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se units being made .
probably starting with spor@@ ts games , which are going to become much more interactive .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
i should tell you that when i was asked to be here , i thought to myself that well , it &apos;s ted .
we had a big dance at the white house .
the first house ever built on a block is house number one .
but that &apos;s refle@@ ctive design as well .
so what does play do for the brain ?
and i could tell from their messa@@ ges and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me .
b@@ f : that &apos;s cool . i always wanted to try that .
the koran dec@@ lar@@ es that it comes to ren@@ e@@ w the message of the tor@@ ah and the go@@ sp@@ els .
our brain is made up of billions of active neurons , around 17@@ 0,000 km of comb@@ ined ax@@ on leng@@ th .
i want to know if there was a moral molecule .
martin lu@@ ther king said that people need to be u@@ pli@@ fted with dig@@ ni@@ ty .
but if you want a more sty@@ lish version you could also paint your na@@ ils in different colors .
there is no shor@@ tage of dy@@ stop@@ ian visions about what happens when our machines become self-@@ aware , and they decide to rise up and co@@ ordin@@ ate attacks against us .
most of them won &apos;t move at all , but some of them might make a tiny step .
there is no one who has done it so far .
so why in the world , you might ask , would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner s@@ elling drugs for $ 3.@@ 50 an hour , with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years ?
so my teeth actually hold my ja@@ w in the corre@@ ct position .
well , this is much more pre@@ valent than we thought at the time .
when you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
in particular check out asia .
so this is the in@@ famous cau@@ ler@@ pa ta@@ xi@@ fo@@ lia , the so@@ -@@ called kil@@ ler al@@ ga@@ e .
and i cri@@ ed .
my reser@@ va@@ tions are princi@@ p@@ ally about the moral ha@@ z@@ ard problem , and i don &apos;t really know how we can best avo@@ id the moral ha@@ z@@ ard .
all across the bor@@ e@@ al , it &apos;s home for a huge incredible range of indi@@ gen@@ ous peop@@ les , and a rich and vari@@ ed culture .
i &apos;ve made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
so this is in the lab . it &apos;s this little task , you know , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes . where can you actually apply this ? which we car@@ ed about , of course .
it &apos;s for a company called mor@@ o@@ so in ital@@ y .
at any rate , when i was a boy , i , like , for instance , i had this -- i got this little book from fort si@@ ll , ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a -- this is about the time that george dy@@ son &apos;s dad thinking about blo@@ wing up nuclear rock@@ ets and stuff .
this is again showing all the different contribu@@ tions .
we had a two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ day-@@ old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn &apos;t taken it from somebody else .
and what &apos;s interesting about this experiment is that it &apos;s not an aber@@ ration .
now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regu@@ lation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instru@@ ments tr@@ es@@ pas@@ s@@ ers as they fle@@ w over land without clear@@ ing the rights of the far@@ ms below as they traveled across the country ?
if we &apos;re going to look for these ste@@ al@@ th black hol@@ es at the center of galaxies , the best place to look is in our own galaxy , our mil@@ ky way .
logi@@ cally , then , if you want to treat insu@@ lin resi@@ stance , you get people to lose weight , right ?
and then here &apos;s one that s@@ ank at the time of hom@@ er , at 7@@ 50 b@@ .@@ c .
there &apos;s going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk , and they &apos;re not going to be working silicon valley , that would not be a reas@@ on@@ able thing for them to do .
this is j@@ im d@@ ine , and it &apos;s the ab@@ sen@@ ce of presence , etc .
thank you very much .
and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the wom@@ b .
it &apos;s such an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening experience to be here .
it doesn &apos;t hit me until years later just how little we had .
women , for the first time this year , became the maj@@ ority of the american work@@ force .
and in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said , &quot; in 35 years of living in this god for@@ sa@@ ken place , you &apos;re the only person that &apos;s come down here and treated us with dig@@ ni@@ ty .
so , here are four r@@ hin@@ o@@ viruses we never knew anything about -- no one &apos;s ever sequen@@ ced them -- and you can also see that you get unique and distingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le patterns .
still , we very much wanted to see the air@@ craft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .
i also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
now , i want you to look at the animal &apos;s back .
nasa &apos;s spending three million dollars a year , three million bucks -- that is like po@@ cket change -- to search for asteroi@@ ds .
here is a drawing by leon@@ ardo da vin@@ ci , 500 years ago , before photograph@@ y .
and it &apos;s through the sharing that people get tac@@ tics of how to take care of themselves , how to dis@@ close how to take medi@@ cin@@ es .
it does hurt . and we rein@@ force the story@@ line , right ?
i &apos;ve seen girls who were be@@ aten by their mothers and brothers and fa@@ thers and un@@ cles .
you buy the box ; i &apos;ll sell the code .
the next thing it hit , a year later , was critical mass . in this case , 20 percent is often a good pro@@ x@@ y for critical mass in a hou@@ se@@ hold .
so , the value of his life was the sum total of his achiev@@ ements .
and now , those profit marg@@ ins are critical , because if you want to scale , if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a k@@ nee , it needs to be econom@@ ically sustainable .
it &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
j@@ ab@@ bar : you can , even if you don &apos;t believe in yourself right now .
nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as .
the birth of a del@@ a@@ yed identical twin is not going to shake western civili@@ zation .
so we have here , this couple .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot;
but then you get the smart , ge@@ e@@ ky kids that have a touch of autism , and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to get them turned on with doing interesting things .
sing@@ er / son@@ g@@ writer e@@ dd@@ i re@@ ader per@@ forms &quot; k@@ ite@@ fl@@ yer &apos;s hill , &quot; a ten@@ der look back at a lost love . with thomas dol@@ by on pi@@ an@@ o .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
remember , from the hole in the wall .
i remember just being so fri@@ ghten@@ ed and terri@@ fied .
we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influ@@ encing access to personal wealth .
i mean , i &apos;ve been saying i &apos;ve been pre@@ pping .
think about watching your bro@@ ther , father , daughter , son , wife in a fire@@ fight in real time and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
the fact that our at@@ titude has changed is in the head@@ lines every day .
they take a look at the dem@@ ands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flo@@ wing to meet those dem@@ ands .
and then i have to try to see in what ways i can make these the hands of god .
i remember just trying to get out of the water .
we were off by 25 percent . how many ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have measu@@ red the speed of light ?
which i think is just fascinating .
but i would always answer myself , &quot; yes , of course you can . &quot;
ph@@ thal@@ ates are addi@@ tives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexi@@ bility , dur@@ ability and transpar@@ ency .
here , i &apos;ll give you an example .
these 10@@ 0-@@ year-old o@@ kin@@ aw@@ an women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day .
you hear about mars , it &apos;s a problem communic@@ ating to mars because it takes light long enough to go there .
but it &apos;s not only that .
the traditional model , it pen@@ ali@@ zes you for experiment@@ ation and failure , but it does not expect ma@@ ster@@ y .
passion is the mot@@ to of all my actions .
finally , we could make the particles migra@@ te to over the po@@ les , so we could ar@@ range the climate engineering so it really focused on the po@@ les .
thank you very much .
everybody thought the answer is , send things to india and china .
this is just stre@@ et@@ -@@ up innovation .
that &apos;s a co@@ p wearing black right there , being fil@@ med with a hid@@ den camera .
it is critical , as these virtual worl@@ ds continue to mirror the real world we live in , that game develop@@ ers realize that they have tremendous responsi@@ bili@@ ties before them .
here &apos;s a wind tur@@ b@@ ine manufactur@@ er that went to a whale .
camer@@ o@@ on , northern camer@@ o@@ on , boom and bu@@ st cy@@ cles of hunger every year for decades .
people are coming in from que@@ ens , trans@@ fer@@ ring from the e train to the 6 train .
and we all need food .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argu@@ e that this is a complete waste of the wh@@ is@@ key , and that i should rather drink it .
and not only did those suici@@ de bom@@ bers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hat@@ red , more rage , more fear and certainly des@@ pair .
it consu@@ mes about 15 watts of power .
the thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news .
this base@@ ball model is incredibly proble@@ matic .
a world tele@@ graphy center -- imagine news , messa@@ ges , sounds , images deli@@ vered to any point in the world inst@@ antly and wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly .
her cat@@ s , god knows how many , who must p@@ is@@ s on her ru@@ gs -- her land@@ ing &apos;s a si@@ ck@@ ening re@@ ek .
no@@ vel@@ ty is adap@@ tive when things are changing and you need to ada@@ pt yourself .
a tur@@ n@@ around in terms of how it man@@ ages its image , and how it takes control of its own dest@@ iny .
i &apos;m 50 , and i don &apos;t have time to go back to school right now -- i &apos;m too busy . so i need somebody who can put me on a quick cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up course on how to do something like that , and lead me through the ma@@ ze of how one does something like this .
i went to as@@ pen recently and st@@ um@@ bled into this song .
so these guys have actually a stronger hand -- three ac@@ es and two k@@ ings .
the air@@ bag@@ -@@ fl@@ atten@@ ing algorith@@ m came from all the develop@@ ments of circle pac@@ king and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs .
i &apos;m also very hop@@ eful that in the next decades , we will make big stri@@ des on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease .
death : death can catch you anywhere , any@@ time , even at the organic .
pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an zones and de@@ di@@ cated traffic lan@@ es are going to be created , and all of this will cut down the average rush hour com@@ mu@@ te to get across town in new york from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes .
but what we can do in the mean@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to su@@ ss out clu@@ es about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
and the answer to that is &quot; yes , &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
we circle around fla@@ gs , and then we can trust each other .
and you see these structures , this thing we call the great wall , but there are vo@@ i@@ ds and those kinds of stuff , and they kind of fa@@ de out because the telescope isn &apos;t sensi@@ tive enough to do it .
and the cell will actually manufac@@ ture the parts that it needs on the fly , from information that &apos;s brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes .
he would re@@ design the entire experience of being scan@@ ned .
if you have a battery , it costs five c@@ ents to make it .
so he walked into my room one evening , and he sat on the edge of my bed , and he said , &quot; j@@ ar@@ re@@ tt , it &apos;s up to you , but if you &apos;d like to , we &apos;d like to send you to the clas@@ ses at the wor@@ c@@ ester art museum . &quot;
let me give you an example of what i mean by har@@ m@@ less but tab@@ o@@ o sexual practice . we gave them scen@@ ari@@ os .
and this is actually the field of mathematics that under@@ lies general rela@@ tivity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe .
then in the same week , at a fun@@ er@@ al , we s@@ ang the familiar hy@@ m@@ n &quot; we p@@ low the fields and sc@@ at@@ ter , &quot; a very english hy@@ m@@ n .
we have to do it , because to let our movement adv@@ ance . &quot;
there &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indi@@ cate that we were coming back .
there is something very re@@ stor@@ ative about nature , and it &apos;s part of how we are tun@@ ed .
it comes ini@@ tially from the latin pati@@ or , to end@@ ure , or to suff@@ er .
so the idea is , all night long the el@@ a@@ stic skin of the third lung will slowly inf@@ late itself , including air and molecules , for sure .
and happiness , of course , is such a va@@ gue word , so let &apos;s say well-@@ being .
watch its feet .
and what this guy had done : he used to produce these fabul@@ ously beautiful wat@@ ches .
the term &quot; deep six &quot; comes to mind : &quot; if it &apos;s too big or too toxic for a land@@ fill , deep six it ! &quot;
what is aston@@ ishing about companies is that they scale sub@@ lin@@ early like biology , indi@@ c@@ ating that they &apos;re domin@@ ated , not by super-@@ linear innovation and ideas ; they become domin@@ ated by econom@@ ies of scale .
basically i &apos;m recor@@ ding one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chr@@ on@@ ologi@@ cally comp@@ il@@ ing these one-@@ second tiny sli@@ ces of my life into one single continu@@ ous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
both par@@ ties absolutely need to resol@@ ve it , but nei@@ ther party wants to be seen as the first to resol@@ ve it .
the ocean bio@@ geographic information system is the dat@@ ab@@ ase for all the cen@@ sus data .
18@@ 6@@ 8 : the second fort lar@@ am@@ ie treat@@ y clearly guaran@@ te@@ es the so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty of the great si@@ ou@@ x nation and the la@@ k@@ ot@@ as &apos; ow@@ ner@@ ship of the sa@@ cre@@ d black h@@ ills .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he thre@@ w his arms around her and bro@@ ke down cr@@ ying .
that &apos;s where we have the fast population growth .
for instance , we &apos;re setting up clinics in africa where we &apos;re going to be giving free anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs , free t@@ b treatment and free malaria treatment .
and now we see all four .
the leaves of the tea , plu@@ cked from the bu@@ sh@@ es ; you know what the action is ? the action is : the lady pi@@ cks up a few leaves , puts them in the bas@@ k@@ et on the back@@ side .
now there &apos;s a book actually , about ki@@ p@@ p -- the place that this is going on -- that ja@@ y mat@@ the@@ ws , a news reporter , wrote -- called , &quot; work hard , be nice . &quot;
what &apos;s going to follow from that behavior is play .
and from our data that gets colle@@ cted , when that tag comes back , because a fis@@ her re@@ turns it for a thousand@@ -@@ dollar re@@ ward , we can get tra@@ cks bene@@ ath the sea for up to five years now , on a back@@ bon@@ ed animal .
there &apos;s a lot of work to be done after that .
thank you .
&apos;@@ i &apos;m being pus@@ hed into a gra@@ ve . the situation is gra@@ ve , &apos; i mo@@ an .
first , i went to mit , the ai lab was there , and i said , well , i want to build intelligent machines , too , but the way i want to do it is to study how brains work first .
it &apos;s com@@ posed of four sub@@ units : a , c , g and t , we call them .
you learn from your mistakes , and you continu@@ ously improve .
why ?
please enjoy .
but that &apos;s obviously irre@@ versi@@ ble , and there could be side effects .
we have to solve the pollu@@ tion , we have to solve the con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on -- but that &apos;s not what interests me in this spe@@ ech .
since we had never been separ@@ ated , and i thought we would be together forever , i didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left .
no , never do a live demo .
on the li@@ ps . ni@@ b@@ ble the e@@ ars maybe .
it allows for us to celebrate the se@@ af@@ o@@ od that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
i mean , certainly ma@@ mm@@ als did . this is one example .
that &apos;s why i said that this is a commercial break .
life in the camp is never simple . even today life is difficult .
of course , cri@@ min@@ als can respond .
the gr@@ at@@ eful dead was playing in the pizza par@@ l@@ ors .
we create financial markets that are super complex .
tried to figure out how to save americans after bat@@ t@@ le@@ field in@@ ju@@ ries .
let me show you a video of what that does to the cell .
while we &apos;re doing ba@@ il@@ ou@@ ts , this is what happened .
and you can see , it &apos;s l@@ um@@ p@@ y bu@@ mp@@ y .
so , contr@@ ary to popular belief , there is not a conflict of interest between em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ism and values .
beauty in the most profound sense of fit .
but that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
se@@ ba@@ stian wer@@ ni@@ cke thin@@ ks every tedtalk can be sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed in six words . in this talk , he shows how to do just that -- and less . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , the scri@@ b@@ bl@@ er is an attemp@@ t to create a gener@@ ative tool .
something that goes beyond what we know in our e@@ go@@ -@@ bo@@ und exi@@ st@@ ence .
if you have things that are cheap enough , people will find uses for them , even if they seem very primi@@ tive .
now i &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
any electrical device -- an appli@@ ance , an exten@@ sion cor@@ d , whatever -- must be able to tell the power out@@ let , &quot; hey , power out@@ let , i &apos;m drawing too much current . shu@@ t me off now , before i start a fire . &quot;
but the goal is to go much further and , very bro@@ ad@@ ly , to democra@@ ti@@ ze all of this knowledge , and to try and be an auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative source in all areas .
it &apos;s used all over the place .
there are microbes out there that actually make gas@@ ol@@ ine , believe it or not .
and that pro@@ mp@@ ted people to make maps like this , with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land , but when you get to the waters edge , the ocean looks like one giant pu@@ ddle of blue paint .
in fact , chemistry &apos;s extremely rich , and our body uses a lot of them .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could actually har@@ ness the power of our bodies , to actually he@@ al ourselves ?
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
i think paul simon is in the audience , and he has -- he may not realize it , but he wrote a song all about whale sex , &quot; sli@@ p-@@ sli@@ d@@ in &apos; away . &quot;
the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes , and therefore we love it .
anybody who dis@@ mis@@ ses the thought of a nuclear wea@@ pon being used by a terror@@ ist is ki@@ dding themselves .
but we &apos;re not so comfortable .
a lot of people won &apos;t take them , or stop taking them , because of their un@@ pleas@@ ant side effects .
well , in pizza , we &apos;re not really -- there &apos;s no w@@ inn@@ ing . how do you win pizza ?
if we spread out the hyper@@ charge and weak charge and p@@ lot the char@@ ges of particles in this two-@@ dimensional charge space , the electric charge is where these particles sit along the ver@@ tical direction .
we &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bi@@ te . &quot;
you can &apos;t really directly sense the world around you .
and i realized , the ro@@ ots of the way i sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things .
my love ...
and i took that driving less@@ on , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to learn how to drive . &quot;
and now we are hit@@ ting those limits on multiple fron@@ ts .
so many , many useful things come out of this .
secon@@ dly you need skills , the m@@ und@@ an@@ e skills of the construction se@@ ctor .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phrase : &quot; real world geome@@ try . &quot;
they &apos;re not supposed to , but they figure out a way .
and the map is actually a little bit bigger .
and you &apos;ve got to start ban@@ ishing a word that &apos;s called &quot; enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment . &quot;
it is a per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al im@@ pulse that pus@@ hes galaxies apart from each other .
200 years ago , in parliament , in great britain , there was a long argument over economy versus mor@@ ality .
so with this an@@ at@@ o@@ mage table , students can experience the dis@@ se@@ ction without a human ca@@ da@@ ver .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citi@@ z@@ en-@@ cent@@ ric internet in the future , we need a bro@@ ader and more susta@@ ined internet freedom movement .
finally , i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replic@@ able , if they happen everywhere else .
it &apos;s just like this one , completely wor@@ th@@ less , in which it alle@@ ge@@ dly worked by &quot; electro@@ sta@@ tic magnetic i@@ on attra@@ ction , &quot; which transl@@ ates to &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ scientific bal@@ on@@ ey &quot; -- would be the nice word -- in which you str@@ ing together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing .
dist@@ ant galaxies were moving away from us .
the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , if we ja@@ m things in the bottom , can get bac@@ ked up like a se@@ wer line that &apos;s clo@@ g@@ ged .
we &apos;re also looking at survival of the fit@@ test , not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground , but really to fit together and build ni@@ ches and have growth that is good .
it still ends up at half a turn .

and it became really big at some point .
mar@@ c ko@@ sk@@ a : 1.@@ 3@@ m reasons to re-@@ inv@@ ent the sy@@ r@@ inge
so , most of the time they re@@ pel .
then pan@@ ban@@ is@@ ha does something unexpected .
so , these two came to lunch , and we got thro@@ wn out of the restaurant .
thank you .
we tell our stories , and a person without a story does not exist .
over the same sp@@ an of time sal@@ es have increas@@ ed by two-@@ thir@@ ds and prof@@ its have dou@@ bled .
these are the dark po@@ ols where global supply cha@@ ins begin -- the global supply cha@@ ins , which bring us our favorite brand name products .
the effect of el si@@ ste@@ ma is felt in three fundamental circles : in the personal / social circle , in the family circle and in the community .
i already knew how to design , but it wasn &apos;t like i was amaz@@ ingly brilliant at it , but more like i was sensi@@ tive to the ideas of gri@@ ds and space and al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment and ty@@ po@@ graphy .
so that &apos;s four points for insects .
and what &apos;s happening here is that wol@@ fra@@ m alpha is not just looking up something ; it &apos;s computing , in real time , where the international space station is right now at this moment , how fast it &apos;s going , and so on .
issu@@ ing an in@@ sur@@ ance policy against ab@@ du@@ ction by ali@@ ens seems a pretty safe bet .
he said , &quot; listen , we &apos;re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degre@@ e ?
we do not have the basis of a pro@@ per partner@@ ship for the future , and yet , out of people &apos;s desire for a global eth@@ ic and a global society that can be done .
it &apos;s exactly the same construction , but no mu@@ ff@@ ins , no mi@@ ce , nothing moving at all .
al@@ is@@ a mil@@ ler : the news about the news
that &apos;s why i became a doctor .
but this app@@ lies , equ@@ ally , to matters of trying to sell new technology .
and we can bar@@ ely find the time to refle@@ ct deeply back in on our own selves .
and it &apos;s looking around , and when it fin@@ ds something , and recogni@@ zes it being foreign , it will actually eng@@ ul@@ f it and eat it .
there &apos;s a fish sitting here .
thanks .
but we basically want a diversity of activi@@ ties the pla@@ yers can play through this .
but the rema@@ ining question was , how ?
here is a cli@@ p from a video , from a piece of anima@@ tion that was written by a writer in hollywood , anima@@ tion worked out in isra@@ el , far@@ med out to cro@@ a@@ ti@@ a and india , and it &apos;s now an international series .
here &apos;s what happens : we &apos;re all busy . everyone &apos;s busy . a woman &apos;s busy .
now , i haven &apos;t met these particular students , but i &apos;ve met students like them .
instead , all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sent@@ ence goes with what kind of crime .
they colle@@ ctively repres@@ ent every one of 8@@ 6 occu@@ pa@@ tional categ@@ ories and ha@@ il from over 80 countries .
the ban@@ ks -- these ban@@ ks are now con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated , and that streng@@ th@@ ening of the banking system has attra@@ cted a lot of invest@@ ment from outside .
so , a sugge@@ sti@@ on for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good sugge@@ sti@@ ons about how to evol@@ ve networks .
they had access to satellite ima@@ gery .
why not learn to fly up@@ side down ? &quot;
so , ar@@ med with all the wisdom of fres@@ h@@ man year biology , i decided i wanted to do cancer research at 15 .
it &apos;s not un@@ common for a single video to have multiple rights ow@@ ners .
it &apos;s a syste@@ m@@ s-@@ level look at how education is admini@@ ster@@ ed and what is being off@@ ered and to wh@@ om .
what i mean by that , and let me use this example , the country of south africa , because i was just there , therefore i &apos;m a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have .
if you test them , all four will get the same sc@@ or@@ es in whatever you ask them .
the company , gi@@ lead , that holds the pat@@ ents , has licen@@ sed the intelle@@ ctu@@ al proper@@ ty to the medi@@ cin@@ es patent pool .
but nothing really says this model of inter@@ activity -- which was so exciting and cap@@ tures the real , the web zeit@@ geist of 1995 -- than &quot; click here for a picture of my dog . &quot;
here , we have a whole bunch of dis@@ par@@ ate images .
so that wasn &apos;t going to work .
he had discovered after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
i didn &apos;t believe that it was possible for us to live any longer , and i started to be attac@@ ked by my own sta@@ phy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus .
and so empathy has basically two chan@@ n@@ els .
so we talk about p@@ mt@@ ct , and we re@@ fer to p@@ mt@@ ct , pre@@ vention of mother to child trans@@ mission .
so this is , as joy moun@@ t@@ ford once said , &quot; the mouse is probably the nar@@ ro@@ west stra@@ w you could try to su@@ ck all of human expression through . &quot;
or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then inst@@ antly pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze the stre@@ ams that catch your attention , just like this .
i expect health and joy and family and community .
girl : oh my god !
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free , virtu@@ ally free , and was very easy to use .
i had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but i had flexible hours .
we &apos;ve extended this to the air now with a gr@@ ant from the slo@@ an foundation .
so it &apos;s right up in the hea@@ v@@ ens .
our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full .
she suspe@@ cts i am using as a tr@@ um@@ p card to run behind medical college girls .
and it has to be bi@@ -@@ dire@@ c@@ tional .
every dv@@ d player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industri@@ es , if they wanted to set that as a condition of s@@ elling you the content .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has pres@@ ented us with a choice -- just as j@@ ill &#91; b@@ ol@@ te &#93; ta@@ y@@ l@@ or was fig@@ uring out how to save her life while she was distra@@ cted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
a simple change to the leg@@ isla@@ tive calendar , such as having business stre@@ t@@ ch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home , that would change the fundamental relationships in con@@ gress .
what is a ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , cur@@ l@@ y-@@ ha@@ i@@ red guy from h@@ oll@@ and -- why is he whist@@ ling ?
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing four billion people just look how many .
through cultural changes , our ance@@ stors lar@@ gely elimin@@ ated early death so that people can now live out their full lives .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
when the museum of modern art &apos;s sen@@ ior cur@@ ator of architecture and design announ@@ ced the ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion of 14 video games in 2012 , &quot; all hell bro@@ ke loo@@ se . &quot; in this far@@ -@@ ran@@ ging , enter@@ ta@@ ining , and deeply insi@@ ght@@ ful talk , paola ant@@ on@@ elli expla@@ ins why she &apos;s deli@@ gh@@ ted to challenge pre@@ conc@@ ei@@ ved ideas about art and g@@ aller@@ ies , and descri@@ bes her bur@@ ning wish to help estab@@ lish a bro@@ ader understanding of design .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly san@@ e . she had no medical problems .
n@@ ina j@@ ab@@ lon@@ ski says that differ@@ ing skin colors are simply our bodies &apos; adap@@ tation to vari@@ ed cli@@ mates and levels of u@@ v ex@@ pos@@ ure . charles darwin dis@@ agreed with this theory , but she expla@@ ins , that &apos;s because he did not have access to nasa .
and it &apos;s really important you understand that for civili@@ zation to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
it &apos;s actually very hot .
i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said , &quot; i &apos;m quit@@ ting . &quot;
and appar@@ ently , evolution had occur@@ red at a pretty rapid rate on one tree , between the time they named it and the time i arri@@ ved , because i &apos;m sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .
the alternative is a strategy of engagement and princi@@ pl@@ ed di@@ alo@@ gue .
they turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of re@@ bo@@ oted the 21@@ st century .
and the same thing is true of , if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer -- and even in these wir@@ eless er@@ as , you don &apos;t get to live in the world without cor@@ ds .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
and up to now , me and my father were deta@@ ched and i still have issues with him .
and we &apos;re starting in june . so this is the mon@@ soon rain .
the middle is an english trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a professional english transl@@ ator who we paid 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ lation .
i can &apos;t tell you what a privilege it is to introduce cur@@ tis w@@ ong from micro@@ soft .
it &apos;s a language . but it is not a language that can be redu@@ ced to a series of program@@ matic not@@ es that we can verb@@ ally write .
there &apos;s one more , i think , wonderful twi@@ st to that tale .
less effort , you &apos;re less per@@ si@@ st@@ ent , and so on .
these are the places that are the rich@@ est in bio@@ diversity and the most important from an ecosystem function poin@@ t-@@ o@@ f-@@ view .
but over the course of several years , i &apos;ve been docum@@ ent@@ ing rem ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as &apos;s c@@ ct@@ v building in bei@@ j@@ ing and the olymp@@ ic stadium in the same city by the archite@@ cts her@@ zog and de me@@ ur@@ on .
and all of that happens in the first second .
it &apos;s a very soli@@ tary cre@@ ature .
so what we &apos;ve next done is we &apos;ve moved on to looking at blood ves@@ sel di@@ lat@@ ation .
you done ?
we must feed three billion people in cities .
to which i need only add , &quot; e@@ z a m@@ i mun@@ kan@@ k ; es ne@@ m is k@@ ev@@ es . &quot;
as i like to say , these are not the &quot; jazz areas &quot; of the brain .
and then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and ti@@ mber -- and it became , you know , a trilli@@ on-@@ dollar economy , and now we take our hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ ons there . the same thing will happen in space .
so what pi@@ pa and sop@@ a risk doing is taking a cent@@ u@@ ries@@ -@@ old legal concept , inno@@ cent until pro@@ ven guil@@ ty , and re@@ ver@@ sing it -- guil@@ ty until pro@@ ven inno@@ cent .
and second , she tells us that she walked up@@ right , but had some adap@@ tation for tree cli@@ m@@ bing .
with all the un@@ even walls and all the cra@@ p everywhere , it actually so@@ unded pretty good .
it &apos;s as far as you can fly on a regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed airplane .
and chris , if you could take the end of that tape measure ?
this is an actual bill .
before going further , let me give you a cr@@ ash course in plant biology .
and despite all of our best eff@@ or@@ ts and inten@@ tions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
and you can see the start of it here .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
you can make money , you can lose money in africa .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever@@ -@@ quick@@ ening speed ?
the whole world was la@@ id out for me .
so the basic idea of i@@ .@@ p@@ . , or internet proto@@ co@@ l , and the way that the -- the rou@@ ting algorith@@ m that used it , were fundamentally &quot; from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . &quot;
it gets it right 99 percent of the time .
at the l@@ ur@@ ie family center for animal ima@@ ging , my colleagu@@ e , andrew kung , grew this cancer success@@ fully in mi@@ ce without ever tou@@ ching plastic .
not like that .
this picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was plac@@ ed in my hands and i brought him over .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
nin@@ ety percent of it was spent on teachers &apos; sal@@ ary and admini@@ strat@@ ors &apos; sal@@ ary .
when we first gave it to them in their en@@ clo@@ sur@@ es , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same char@@ ges as the first but have much higher mas@@ ses .
well , they &apos;re still coming in from the back there ; they &apos;re still coming in .
so english man@@ ia is a turning point .
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneur@@ ship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contribu@@ ting hu@@ gely to the society .
i said , in exchange for education in how to paint , i will support them , and i started a company .
it &apos;s an illusion , like sun@@ sets .
it fe@@ eds the english requi@@ re@@ ment .
why ? because when the tac@@ ks are out of the box , it &apos;s pretty easy isn &apos;t it ?
yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s r@@ ar@@ ely asked .
he &apos;s only ever been mar@@ ried twice .
you saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn &apos;t before .
and to my aston@@ is@@ h@@ ment , when i began ser@@ i@@ ously studying other tradi@@ tions , i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a f@@ uss about today -- is only a very recent religi@@ ous enthusias@@ m that sur@@ fac@@ ed only in the west , in about the 17@@ th century .
go ahead and take it off , you &apos;re ok . we &apos;ll just stop for a second .
but what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is how these tis@@ su@@ es make awesome models .
simil@@ arly , in the arab world , there was what the great arab histor@@ ian al@@ bert h@@ our@@ an@@ i defin@@ es as the liber@@ al age .
if they had some extra band@@ wid@@ th , they would deliver a message for you .
civil wars and eth@@ ni@@ c conflicts have brought the world incredible suffering , but ste@@ f@@ an wol@@ ff &apos;s fig@@ ures show that , in the last 20 years , their number has ste@@ adi@@ ly decre@@ as@@ ed . he extra@@ cts critical lessons from northern ireland , liber@@ ia , ti@@ mor and more to show that lea@@ der@@ ship , diplo@@ macy and institu@@ tional design are our three most effective wea@@ po@@ ns in wa@@ ging peace .
how ? we designed a simple to@@ ol@@ k@@ it , conver@@ ted it into eight langu@@ ages , and reached 3@@ 2,000 schools .
in the 19@@ 50s , a small organis@@ m appeared in rich@@ mond , virginia , called the he@@ m@@ lo@@ ck wo@@ olly ad@@ el@@ gi@@ d .
here is some of the lower level of the library , where the exhi@@ bits constantly change .
in 19@@ 10 , they looked at the exam@@ in@@ ations that the state of o@@ hi@@ o gave to 14@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , and they found that they were all for soci@@ ally valu@@ ed con@@ crete information .
it &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
i may be an &#91; odd &#93; student with un@@ conventional interests , but i hope i am making a contribu@@ tion by sharing my story with all of you .
this easy vari@@ ability is the sign of a bad explanation , because , without a func@@ tional reason to pre@@ fer one of coun@@ t@@ less vari@@ ants , adv@@ oc@@ ating one of them , in pre@@ ference to the others , is ir@@ rational .
so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game .
how many people knew the fo@@ under@@ s of facebook and google before their faces were on a magazine cover ?
and that shor@@ es up our economy , makes it st@@ able .
so i &apos;m going to talk today about colle@@ cting stories in some un@@ conventional ways .
so chris was able to do his change -- he didn &apos;t have to lo@@ g in or anything ; he just went on the website and made a change .
so that &apos;s getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
swit@@ ching back , morning , after@@ no@@ on , evening , morning , after@@ no@@ on , evening .
and bill clin@@ ton walked away in tears because he had fail@@ ed to get what he wanted .
re@@ gre@@ t is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happ@@ ier if we had done something different in the past .
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your mov@@ ements so as to mini@@ mi@@ ze the negative con@@ sequence of the noise .
his hol@@ iness the kar@@ ma@@ pa talks about how he was discovered to be the rein@@ car@@ nation of a re@@ vered figure in ti@@ bet@@ an buddh@@ ism . in telling his story , he ur@@ ges us to work on not just technology and design , but the technology and design of the heart . he is transl@@ ated on@@ stage by ty@@ ler de@@ war .
we don &apos;t have any in@@ cen@@ tive to go and resol@@ ve it across the u.s .
with language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
mor@@ e@@ over , almost all these genetic vari@@ ants we see outside africa have clo@@ sely related dna sequences that you find inside africa .
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .
and what happens if you water and feed that se@@ ed appropri@@ ately , is it will do a develop@@ mental compu@@ tation , a molecular compu@@ tation , and it &apos;ll build an electron@@ ic computer .
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that c@@ ali@@ bra@@ tion of clo@@ sen@@ ess and distance that en@@ ables me to find the people that i need right now , that en@@ ables me to find the sour@@ ces of inti@@ macy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
when we share ideas we all get more .
but i didn &apos;t actually do anything .
they are hospital shi@@ ps .
my ini@@ tial work focused on uganda , where i focused on negoti@@ ating re@@ forms with the finance mini@@ stry of uganda so they could access our lo@@ ans .
my friend &apos;s book , mar@@ ia ste@@ ph@@ an &apos;s book , talks a lot about violent and non@@ violent struggle , and there are some sho@@ cking data .
i very much res@@ on@@ ate with what you &apos;re saying , because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever . do you have any ad@@ vice ?
it was my lon@@ gest operation .
cru@@ cially , we haven &apos;t been fig@@ uring out how to live in on@@ eness with the earth and every other living thing .
you have swe@@ at@@ shops in h@@ ells .
but before i do , i just want to men@@ tion that this animal truly is a sort of the su@@ v of the sand , the ship of the desert . it &apos;s so v@@ ital to the in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants of the areas in which the cam@@ el is found -- lar@@ gely mon@@ go@@ lia and sa@@ har@@ a -- that there are 1@@ 60 words in arab@@ ic to describe the cam@@ el .
j@@ o : normal . england and america , england and america .
and the second thing is , we &apos;re going to re@@ structure its architecture .
it &apos;s about experi@@ encing what it means to be a sea cre@@ ature .
and it was exhi@@ b@@ ited al@@ ong@@ side ours .
and this is even more dangerous -- well , it &apos;s dangerous again .
but may i ?
in the end , he dre@@ w a house . it was the most boring thing .
they all work like this kan@@ g@@ aro@@ o , they bo@@ un@@ ce .
health to the ocean means health for us .
that actually re@@ moves about 95 percent of the carbon black , that stuff that , with o@@ zone , is responsible for about half of global warming &apos;s effects , because it changes , it se@@ tt@@ les on the snow , it changes the refle@@ ctors , it changes the trans@@ mission qu@@ alities of the atmosphere .
that allows the company to raise oper@@ ational budgets without having to compe@@ te with other ven@@ ues with much larger audi@@ tori@@ ums .
e : me@@ o@@ w .
and then we &apos;re off to the ra@@ ces , because i don &apos;t believe for a second that we have for@@ gotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too a@@ pa@@ thetic or har@@ d-@@ he@@ ar@@ ted to even try .
an o@@ live ser@@ ver .
so -- so you may ask yourself , who is this du@@ de ?
the hol@@ y gra@@ il , of course , is the gps dot .
you &apos;re afraid to try . you &apos;re afraid you may fa@@ il .
it &apos;s on the che@@ ck@@ list : c@@ un@@ ning and manipu@@ la@@ tive .
thank you very much .
there was also some creative interpretation involved .
however , the media is not telling us the whole truth .
it &apos;s just basically two strands .
i love that , but we don &apos;t have the time .
because , you see , dna is like a blu@@ e@@ print that tells living things what to make .
we need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets i was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world .
so , turned out he &apos;s a fantastic com@@ pos@@ er , and over the last few years has been a const@@ ant collabor@@ ator of ours . he has made many , many pieces .
and then everybody else would have to licen@@ se this cu@@ ff or this sle@@ e@@ ve because jo@@ e blo@@ w ow@@ ns it .
this is probably a better picture .
good morning .
let &apos;s take bo@@ got@@ a . poor , lat@@ in@@ o , surro@@ unded by run@@ away gun violence and drug traff@@ i@@ cking : a re@@ pu@@ tation not unlike that of the south bronx .
yet , he was my greatest teacher .
and we had to take action . now our kids found out about it .
and when i talk about my ideas , they &apos;re like , &quot; b@@ but it &apos;s not sc@@ al@@ able , you know .
in this arti@@ stic and scientific inst@@ al@@ lation , bio@@ gener@@ ative algorithms are helping us to understand self-@@ generation and growth : very important for simulation in the nano@@ sc@@ aled sci@@ ences .
it expres@@ ses , but it doesn &apos;t solve , an underlying problem .
the next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adop@@ ters .
and out in eastern mon@@ tan@@ a there &apos;s a lot of space , a lot of b@@ ad@@ lands , and not very many people , and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
i don &apos;t want hid@@ den , i want to see it .
this is what statisti@@ cians techni@@ cally call a dam@@ n fine bet .
and we were very , very happy .
now , i must tell you that this was never a very popular argument , and it &apos;s probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience .
you &apos;ll never lose tra@@ ck of your things again .
and there are sig@@ ns that the industry is getting the message .
actually , what happens is that a very in@@ tri@@ cate structure appears .
news from india is a stream on my smar@@ t@@ phone app whether i &apos;m in new york or new del@@ hi .
and of course , as i men@@ tioned before , since we can now start to map brain function , we can start to t@@ ie these into the individual cells .
and it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of meas@@ ur@@ able goals achiev@@ ed by the world &apos;s leaders .
it changed my life .
and a small part of my brain is thinking , &apos; that is so gross and really dangerous , &apos; but most of my brain is thinking , &apos; please let there be some s@@ ma@@ ck left by the time it gets to me .
but a multiple polar@@ ity of power means shi@@ f@@ ting and changing alli@@ an@@ ces .
we have ra@@ va@@ ged our earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
we &apos;ve got a new one this year , but we &apos;ll work on that next season .
and , actually , you get more appreci@@ ation for glam@@ our when you realize what went into creating it .
and they &apos;re a@@ im@@ ed at prote@@ cting the relationships .
and in those days , my hair was down to my wa@@ ist , i dro@@ ve a motor@@ cycle , i was un@@ mar@@ ried , i ow@@ ned a bar , so those were different times .
in any case , the way it works is that an intelligent na@@ vig@@ ator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
and she had come to washington , not see@@ king a hand@@ out and not see@@ king a micro@@ lo@@ an .
mothers with hiv car@@ ing for mothers with hiv .
and so this , again , a real picture of the ice foun@@ tains ris@@ ing up into space , absolutely beautiful .
we &apos;ve got students at harvard . we &apos;re six years old .
it &apos;s really a very precisely ti@@ med thing .
they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divi@@ de , and they &apos;ve always been consi@@ dered to be these as@@ o@@ cial re@@ clu@@ sive organisms .
for ban@@ kers , we &apos;d be living off the princi@@ p@@ al , not the interest .
add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
and when mar@@ wood made the jump , he was covered with was@@ ps st@@ inging him in the face and eyes . he nearly let go .
des@@ er@@ ti@@ fication is a fan@@ cy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
by the time i re@@ turned everything had always been ne@@ at@@ ly re@@ turned to its place .
tam@@ ara rou@@ ka@@ er@@ ts : we &apos;re ready to go .
this is a tri@@ -@@ star , and so they let nat@@ as@@ ha actually sit in the jump seat .
and today , they are with you in long beach .
the wor@@ ms are growing in@@ ches per week !
and of course risk . i think architecture should be ris@@ ky .
these two new air@@ planes are the same speed as the d@@ c@@ 8 that was done in 195@@ 8 .
some of the greatest innova@@ tions and develop@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ se@@ ction of two fields .
if you think about antar@@ c@@ tica , it &apos;s techni@@ cally a desert , it gets so little preci@@ pit@@ ation .
it does something in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to the act .
one area turns on , and a big area shu@@ ts off , so that you &apos;re not in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited , so that you &apos;re willing to make mistakes , so that you &apos;re not constantly shu@@ tting down all of these new gener@@ ative im@@ pul@@ ses .
now , if you watch nin@@ e-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years of television -- no sleep , no po@@ tty brea@@ ks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss , and then at the end there &apos;s 30 seconds of , &quot; and i won , &quot; the li@@ ke@@ lihood that you would play the lot@@ tery is very small .
we all know about the mi@@ ra@@ cle of mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation .
and the reference to the ipo@@ d as icon@@ ic , and in a way ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive of performance , deli@@ very -- quite interesting that &#91; in &#93; the beginning of the year 2007 , the financial times comm@@ ented that the de@@ troit companies en@@ vy the hal@@ o effect that to@@ y@@ ota has ga@@ ined from the pri@@ us as the hybri@@ d , energ@@ y-@@ conscious vehicle , which ri@@ v@@ als the ipo@@ d as an icon@@ ic product .
but they had seen movies like &quot; wall street , &quot; and they kind of had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world .
his li@@ ve@@ lihood is pre@@ determin@@ ed by the conditions of gr@@ in@@ ding poverty .
you get an eg@@ g@@ be@@ ater , which is everywhere , and you saw off a bla@@ de , and then you take tu@@ bing , and you stick it on that . you put the blood in , you spin it -- somebody si@@ ts there and sp@@ ins it .
two years ago , in gal@@ en@@ a city , ch@@ ih@@ u@@ a@@ hu@@ a , a me@@ mber of the community was ki@@ dna@@ pped , eric le bar@@ ó@@ n .
every mode of transport that we use , whether it &apos;s planes , tra@@ ins , au@@ tom@@ o@@ bil@@ es , bi@@ kes , hor@@ ses , is re@@ us@@ able , but not rock@@ ets .
a democracy could be u@@ ph@@ eld peac@@ efully .
this is a minute 5@@ 9 .
in the foot@@ no@@ te pan@@ el that ac@@ companies this work i photographed an offici@@ al adol@@ ph hit@@ ler po@@ stage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by british intelligence with hans frank &apos;s image on it .
there aren &apos;t very many more opportunities like this in the world .
some recent stories : nano@@ be@@ es za@@ p tumor@@ s with real bee ven@@ om ; they &apos;re sen@@ ding genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can cra@@ w@@ l through the human body .
there we lived with the inu@@ it in the tiny inu@@ it community of 200 inu@@ it people , where &#91; we &#93; were one of three non-@@ inu@@ it families .
and the fundamental answer is that the pro-@@ aging trance is not as du@@ mb as it looks .
at the time of the accident , but not everybody accep@@ ted that fa@@ te .
which in my experience means communication that man@@ ages to speak to and exp@@ and our concept of self-@@ interest .
we talk about how another world isn &apos;t just possible ; another world &apos;s here .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really in@@ tri@@ cate projects like leaves sor@@ ted by hu@@ e , so you get a color fa@@ de and put in a circle like a w@@ re@@ ath .
the second path is eu@@ da@@ im@@ oni@@ an flow .
he &apos;s interested in playing football .
and so , i have here what we call the &quot; paradig@@ ms . &quot;
and for that reason , polio er@@ adi@@ cation : it &apos;s the ultimate in equ@@ ity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justi@@ ce .
and that , as indi@@ cated by the white line , occur@@ red 46 days before the pe@@ ak of the epide@@ mic .
so there &apos;s only 2@@ 7 people per square mile , which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer .
we calculate gra@@ dient sur@@ faces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there &apos;s a high prob@@ ability of life .
and then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for pro@@ state cancer and one for breast cancer , and we treat these as if they &apos;re separate diseases and that this way of divi@@ ding them had something to do with what actually went wrong .
and that &apos;s de@@ pic@@ ted on this slide . this is your skin .
i love these ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old , nin@@ et@@ y-@@ year-old guys and women .
you have heard that phrase u@@ tter@@ ed by your friends , family , schools and the media for decades .
they are the ones who tried to send the under@@ wear bom@@ ber here , and they were using the internet to try and inst@@ ig@@ ate violence among american muslims .
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years , and what i learned when i came to the gal@@ a@@ pa@@ gos is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wild@@ life , and the amazing qu@@ alities that pen@@ gu@@ ins have .
you can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that pro@@ sper@@ ity is being built .
sum@@ mer@@ time and the living is easy fish are jump@@ ing and the c@@ ot@@ ton is high oh , your da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s rich and your ma is goo@@ d-@@ looking so hus@@ h little baby don &apos;t you cry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
and this is basically the result we had before .
&quot; i &apos;m going to destroy and@@ ro@@ id because it &apos;s a stolen product . &quot;
we think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up g@@ uns .
and what i then found out about what &apos;s called the e-@@ patient movement -- i &apos;ll explain what that term means .
it &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s sh@@ ining as bri@@ ghtly as the center of the galaxy with a billion s@@ uns in it .
the teachers are as di@@ verse as the student body , and the amazing thing is that volunte@@ ers are po@@ pping up .
it &apos;s loud , clear -- you can hear it very clearly .
so i decided to get engaged , and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were .
it &apos;s a very , very good idea to get them wired .
the solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think , because all of those cities we &apos;re building are opportunities .
this particular shri@@ mp , we &apos;ve du@@ b@@ bed it the j@@ ur@@ assi@@ c shri@@ mp , it &apos;s thought to have gone extin@@ ct 50 years ago -- at least it was , until the cen@@ sus discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australi@@ a .
and the st@@ ated goal was to increase popular support for the afgh@@ an government .
it happened through a principle known as k@@ in sele@@ ction .
and worst of all , we will never know .
thank you very much .
these sequences right up here -- which don &apos;t even code for protein , by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these , so i could use this sequence as a mar@@ ker to dete@@ ct a wide spectrum of viruses , without having to make something individual .
it makes me really feel that that civili@@ zation -- which , as i say , if you believe the scientific creation story , has emer@@ ged pur@@ ely as a result of the laws of physics , and a few hydro@@ gen atoms -- then i think , to me anyway , it makes me feel incredibly valuable .
it &apos;s called &quot; peace on earth . &quot;
when we apply the fields -- again , in the identical ti@@ me@@ -@@ scale to the identical culture -- you &apos;re going to see something different .
hans rosling : asia &apos;s rise -- how and when
because if you don &apos;t have that sa@@ men@@ ess , physi@@ ologi@@ cally , you &apos;re going to be si@@ ck or you &apos;re going to die .
and they ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ated .
so , a nap@@ k@@ in . draw a little model galaxy in the middle .
okay .
and , sa@@ dly , we don &apos;t know .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of no@@ where .
liber@@ ation , however , costs some money .
and with that , what this gra@@ ff@@ iti says is , &quot; high-@@ tech sch@@ mi@@ gh@@ -@@ tech .
as in , for instance , that little matter of virg@@ ins and par@@ ad@@ ise .
so watch this be@@ et@@ le , and there &apos;s two things that i would like you to be aware of .
so we have some kind of pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al soup .
and i &apos;ll get into why we &apos;ve so far been sp@@ ared in a moment .
i don &apos;t know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and , after that shoot , dirty jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
we think , ken and i , that there are real sour@@ ces of hope .
later when this material was transl@@ ated into a common european language , which is to say latin , they simply replac@@ ed the gre@@ ek ka@@ i with the latin x .
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
you just need a few people -- -- who will look at the rules , realize they make no sense , and realize how much they want to be connected .
the &quot; high se@@ as &quot; is a legal term , but in fact , it covers 50 percent of the planet .
and that happens at every peri@@ pher@@ al no@@ de .
after every convin@@ cing point , people will go , &quot; amen , amen , amen . &quot;
and it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now jo@@ ined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspe@@ cts .
after a few years , they had several new@@ spa@@ pers in central and eastern europe .
the next great stage , which all of you are so familiar with : the massive information revolution .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
and it wouldn &apos;t simply change everything , it would change everything all at once . &quot;
so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the hand@@ le -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimi@@ ze .
and if you ask these people why they work on li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al battery , their answer would he@@ ar@@ ken back to president kenne@@ dy &apos;s re@@ mar@@ ks at rice university in 196@@ 2 when he said -- and i &apos;m taking liber@@ ties here -- &quot; we choose to work on gri@@ d-@@ level stor@@ age , not because it is easy , but because it is hard . &quot;
au@@ bre@@ y de grey : my name &apos;s au@@ bre@@ y de grey , from cambridge .
so we had a dr@@ y suit developed -- i worked with a team in nor@@ way -- based on a sort of survival suit -- i sup@@ pose , that he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter pil@@ ots would wear -- that i could climb into . it would go on over my boots , over my mit@@ tens , it would pull up around my face , and se@@ al pretty ti@@ ghtly around my face .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
so , maybe spra@@ ying dd@@ t on cro@@ ps is a really bad idea .
and in 19@@ 45 , he published an article in a magazine called atlantic mon@@ th@@ ly .
you get a fol@@ ded shape -- in this case , a co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach .
that &apos;s really what i would like you to do .
and so , for three years he was out , and he could only blin@@ k , and so i realized at this moment , i thought , wow -- how fra@@ gi@@ le is this thing we &apos;re wearing , this body and mind we &apos;re wearing , and so i thought , how do you go for it more ?
a@@ g : because i am an old man . i am actually 15@@ 8 .
we talked about the well , and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history .
so , this guy , with all the cells in his body , all have the same genetic information .
but i decided not to have this treatment .
the way we test dylan is by giving it in@@ puts , as i said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in project pra@@ k@@ ash would get .
so at that point , 19@@ 12 , we sele@@ cted cru@@ de oil over whale oil and some more coal .
the reason we can be so well off , even though there is so many people on earth , is because of the power of ideas .
in janu@@ ary i saw an exhi@@ bit of fern@@ and@@ o bot@@ er@@ o &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings at the u@@ c berk@@ ele@@ y library .
the rocket &apos;s position is shown by the traject@@ ory that we &apos;re now looking at .
the exc@@ it@@ ement of a great or@@ che@@ str@@ a performance comes from the attemp@@ t to have a collective of musi@@ cians producing one uni@@ fied whole concept .
another example is a streng@@ th date , in which we get cou@@ ples to identify their highest streng@@ ths on the streng@@ ths test , and then to design an evening in which they both use their streng@@ ths , and we find this is a streng@@ th@@ en@@ er of relationships .
but i &apos;m here to tell you that technologies are more mal@@ le@@ able than that .
they would offer s@@ wee@@ ts or money .
this means that the bi@@ ases that lead investor@@ s to do b@@ ad@@ ly , that lead to the fore@@ clo@@ sure crisis are going to be really hard to over@@ come .
because , again , i &apos;m trying to get energy sol@@ ved for america .
very advan@@ ced , no air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning -- i love it .
and it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my exc@@ it@@ ement , he ans@@ wer@@ ed me directly and he said , &quot; because che@@ fs don &apos;t des@@ erve my fo@@ ie gras . &quot;
i &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
a lot of people think in a very engli@@ sh@@ -@@ cent@@ ric way on the internet , but for us , we &apos;re truly global . we &apos;re in many , many langu@@ ages .
there are no little tan@@ ks where we &apos;re making surge@@ ons .
and then , year after@@ ward , 1995 , in ko@@ be , japan , we had a big earth@@ qua@@ ke .
i guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
you can kind of sk@@ et@@ ch with pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h and just google for game controll@@ ers .
but in most of the rest of the world , that &apos;s not the case .
so here we are . these are proto@@ cells , patter@@ ning their environment .
r@@ sw : the picture on the screen , is that dis@@ ney ?
and i watched young el@@ v@@ is begin to psy@@ ch her@@ self up for the hill .
i sho@@ wer@@ ed in cam@@ p@@ gro@@ unds . i ate out regul@@ arly .
so , again , going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gest@@ ure di@@ ct@@ ated the design of this product .
it &apos;s not going to be mine after i die .
as stephen ha@@ w@@ king fam@@ ously said , we &apos;re just a chemical sc@@ um on the surface of a typical planet that &apos;s in or@@ bit around a typical star , which is on the ou@@ ts@@ kir@@ ts of a typical galaxy , and so on .
transpar@@ ency can be mis@@ dire@@ cted .
if you want to pause it , you can pause it .
because the whole business of actually suggest@@ ing that someone is breaking the law and then ga@@ ther@@ ing evidence and pro@@ ving that , that turns out to be really in@@ convenient .
let me just tell you two really quickly .
we have dis@@ crete data elements ; we don &apos;t have a time function on them .
but there is a continu@@ ous world from walking , bi@@ king , driving , flying -- there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
imagine now taking an ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ cally reali@@ stic situation -- imagine two black hol@@ es that have lived a long life together .
it em@@ powered auth@@ orities , and , as a result , marg@@ in@@ alized citizens .
he has one of the world &apos;s largest colle@@ ctions -- about 500 of them .
hi , my name is mar@@ cin -- far@@ mer , technolog@@ ist .
now music re@@ ven@@ ues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since nap@@ ster first came on the scene .
it &apos;s just the per@@ si@@ ans who aren &apos;t fully human and don &apos;t des@@ erve to be treated very ni@@ c@@ ely .
everyone in here will be between 3.@@ 2 and 3.@@ 6 c@@ m .
here &apos;s two creatures who &apos;ve never heard of eu@@ cli@@ d &apos;s parallel po@@ stu@@ late -- didn &apos;t know it was impossible to viol@@ ate , and they &apos;re simply getting on with it .
mary dou@@ glas asked in an es@@ say on poverty written 35 years ago .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s stupid .
so for instance , today , in ghana , coura@@ geous re@@ form@@ ers from civil society , parliament and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ ali@@ tion for transpar@@ ent contra@@ cts in the oil se@@ ctor , and , gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zed by this , re@@ form@@ ers in parliament are now investig@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous contra@@ cts .
but i think there &apos;s something really po@@ e@@ tic about using nuclear power to pro@@ pel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion re@@ ac@@ tors .
it is the network ; and in my case , the network has been important in media , because i get to connect to people .
but this is no ordinary well .
now , there &apos;s one big change since the com@@ modi@@ ty bo@@ oms of the 197@@ 0s , and that is the spread of democracy .
we need to can@@ v@@ as and send out volunte@@ ers .
though i was atta@@ ched to this u@@ gly , un@@ wanted , high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance , mechan@@ ical pet , my life was kind of like the happy part in an oper@@ a -- very complicated , but in a good way .
now po@@ ll@@ s show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assum@@ ing the women they ask told the truth .
that &apos;s how we met .
so what &apos;s happening now , in the digital age , is that we can quanti@@ fy value in lots of different ways and do it more easily , and sometimes the way that we quanti@@ fy those values , it makes it much easier to create new forms and val@@ id forms of cur@@ ren@@ cy .
we &apos;re fishing at the low end .
the way i suspe@@ ct it will happen is using artificial chromosom@@ es and extra chromosom@@ es , so we go from 46 to 4@@ 7 or 4@@ 8 .
here a community camp just organi@@ zed by the community themselves , where they find a place , organi@@ ze volunte@@ ers , and then we &apos;ll do our part . you know , check their vision , and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then deter@@ mine what further testing should be done , and then those tests are done by techni@@ cians who check for glas@@ ses , or check for glau@@ com@@ a .
it has to get very comp@@ elling before we &apos;ll pay attention .
we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
in ad@@ h@@ d , it &apos;s often assum@@ ed that the hyper@@ activity caus@@ es the learning dis@@ ability .
i &apos;m very proud to show you the te@@ aser .
because , if we can bubble up the very best from a va@@ stly larger pool , this whe@@ el turns .
all the conversation stopped . all the eyes turned to me .
this is a violent process .
i spend a lot of time on the road .
the little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , chri@@ stop@@ her colum@@ bus cros@@ sed the atlantic .
you can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
and i can imagine this dog , you know , speaking through the f@@ ence to , say , an ak@@ it@@ a , saying , &quot; wow , my ow@@ ners , they are so incredibly easy to train .
and so in this case , because it &apos;s about a lot of these images and what they repres@@ ent , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say , &quot; well , what &apos;s world@@ chan@@ g@@ ing@@ .com , with these images , have to do ? &quot;
so my wife sm@@ ells ni@@ cer than i do , or i just st@@ ink more than she does .
but what was interesting was , the pakistan@@ i muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle east@@ ern@@ ers and pakistan@@ is from all over the world .
in the middle of stars , you &apos;re jo@@ ining hydro@@ gen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon , to make oxygen , all the things that you &apos;re made of are made in the middle of stars .
they have a magazine that they call g@@ 2 .
when we started this , i set up the simulation one evening .
people with mil@@ d depression , they don &apos;t have a bias when they look into the future .
but if it &apos;s somebody from another group , these terrible people -- i mean , not terrible in this -- but somebody we don &apos;t want to associ@@ ate ourselves with , from another university , another group , all of a sudden people &apos;s awareness of hon@@ est@@ y goes up -- a little bit like the ten comm@@ and@@ ments experiment -- and people che@@ at even less .
and when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print in@@ d@@ ul@@ gen@@ ces , which was the equivalent of printing money .
on your ri@@ ght-@@ hand side you can see a cu@@ cum@@ ber lea@@ f , and on the middle , c@@ ot@@ ton lea@@ f , and on the left a to@@ ma@@ to lea@@ f with these little sti@@ p@@ pl@@ ings .
the worst idea in all of psych@@ ology is the idea that the mind is a blank s@@ late at birth .
he said , &quot; look , these are the stron@@ gest and most able men in the country .
and remember i was telling you about har@@ ry po@@ tter .
and we run clinics in these very remote regi@@ ons where there &apos;s no medical care whatsoever .
just do it outside , please . &quot;
and later this year , the ra@@ il minister was sa@@ cked and sent@@ enced to ja@@ il for 10 years .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pre@@ g@@ nant and the first scan reve@@ aled that my baby had a birth de@@ fe@@ ct associated with ex@@ pos@@ ure to est@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic chemicals in the wom@@ b and the second scan reve@@ aled no he@@ art@@ beat .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
the team from ta@@ i@@ w@@ an was a little bit more ambi@@ tious .
but he never contro@@ ls it .
and you &apos;re looking at how it dra@@ pes over and differenti@@ ates from the body .
many of you will remember this super c@@ ute video from the last ted , but not all quad@@ cop@@ ter s@@ war@@ ms are so nice and c@@ ute .
we were too late into the summer ; the ice was starting to melt ; we spoke to the rus@@ si@@ an he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter pil@@ ots on the radio , and they said , &quot; look bo@@ ys , you &apos;ve run out of time .
our goal for robo@@ tics is to un@@ lo@@ ck everyone &apos;s mental power by making the world more physi@@ cally ac@@ c@@ essi@@ ble to people such as myself and others like me around the glo@@ be .
be@@ au lot@@ to : so , this game is very simple .
so , far@@ ming based on how a pra@@ ir@@ ie buil@@ ds soil , ran@@ ching based on how a native un@@ gu@@ late her@@ d actually incre@@ ases the health of the range , even waste@@ water treatment based on how a mar@@ sh not only cle@@ ans the water , but creates incredibly spar@@ kl@@ ing produ@@ ctivity .
so , these are the dark ages .
so let me show you a film -- a piece from that film -- and how a camera also -- so this is a scene , where in my mind , she was at the dep@@ ths of mortality .
it &apos;s the one great pre@@ ven@@ tive health success we have in our health care system .
to get to that stage , we genu@@ in@@ ely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground .
the shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers tend to give you things like an oni@@ on or an as@@ pir@@ in , or a piece of g@@ um , because they don &apos;t have small change .
to close , i want to point out that we &apos;re also explor@@ ing new business models for this new field of neuro@@ technology .
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
and what you had to do was -- if you wanted to partici@@ pate in this , you had to share pac@@ ke@@ ts of information .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
they wi@@ ped her bin@@ di off her fore@@ head .
what about all those other species ?
and you heard just now what the goal is .
nam@@ ely , that when they cast b@@ ells , they write in@@ scri@@ p@@ tions on them .
and i think what you &apos;ll see emerging is this notion of a global one-@@ world class@@ room .
they are going to think about it as this gl@@ ori@@ ous inst@@ ant when we la@@ id down the very founda@@ tions of their lives , of their society , of their future .
but then , 197@@ 1 started a@@ ero@@ viron@@ ment , with no emplo@@ ye@@ es -- then one or two , three , and sort of f@@ um@@ bled along on trying to get interesting projects .
they &apos;re like sun sho@@ es , but , you know , with sand .
so , the real issue is : how do you tan@@ gi@@ bili@@ tate compassion ?
and do you get along ? i certainly hope so , because at some point or another on this expedi@@ tion , one of your team@@ mates is going to have to take a very big nee@@ d@@ le , and put it in an infe@@ cted bli@@ ster , and dra@@ in it for you .
can@@ op@@ y soil can occu@@ r up to a meter deep , hundreds of feet above the ground , and there are organisms in this soil that have , as yet , no names .
massive technological adv@@ ance : took an incredibly de@@ ad@@ ly disease , made it sol@@ v@@ able .
well , you could develop flu@@ -@@ like symptom@@ s .
it was alive once , hun@@ ted , stolen , stre@@ t@@ ched .
and you see how the dark matter l@@ um@@ ps up , and the ordinary matter just tra@@ ils along behind .
thir@@ ty thousand children are en@@ li@@ sted and are made to fight in ar@@ med groups .
today , 35 percent of americans practice cogni@@ tively dem@@ and@@ ing professi@@ ons , not only to the professi@@ ons pro@@ per like law@@ yer or doctor or scientist or le@@ c@@ tur@@ er , but many , many sub-@@ professi@@ ons having to do with being a techni@@ cian , a computer progra@@ mmer .
hey .
we think we can ju@@ dge people on their expres@@ sions .
solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art bu@@ yer at macy &apos;s , and like so many people , he strug@@ gl@@ ed to find a new one during the re@@ c@@ ession .
and i said , &quot; look , i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them , to see if you appro@@ ve of them .
and more co2 caus@@ es more warming .
ultimately , design itself is a process of const@@ ant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers .
when ha@@ l &apos;s dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song , as a reference to when computers became human .
and of course , through all of these lines are flo@@ wing un@@ stru@@ ctu@@ red language .
i was going to wear it , but i thought i &apos;d get co@@ st@@ a to do it , my lo@@ vely assi@@ stant .
strate@@ gic .
now , everyone else had assum@@ ed it was , and we knew it was because we were working with it .
so my next film is called &quot; pa@@ an@@ i &quot; which means water .
ten@@ ding those 3@@ 1 dying people were young women from villa@@ ges around ban@@ gal@@ ore .
and your motor comm@@ and saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phan@@ tom , there is no arm , right ?
she found her@@ self listening to a consu@@ l@@ t@@ ant one day who was trying to help teachers boo@@ st the test sc@@ or@@ es of the kids , so that the school would reach the eli@@ te categ@@ ory in per@@ cent@@ age of kids pas@@ sing big tests .
he said -- he called what he &apos;d done as making -- they didn &apos;t call it a vac@@ u@@ um pu@@ mp at the time .
we hit the last gl@@ ac@@ ial maximum around 16@@ ,000 years ago , but basically , from 7@@ 0,000 years on , things were getting really tough , getting very cold . the northern he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere had massive growing ice she@@ ets .
there &apos;s actually three base@@ ball fields on it right now , and they &apos;re going to stay there .
the gre@@ e@@ ks say we suff@@ er our way to wisdom .
but before we do that , i &apos;d like you to think that at any given time when you &apos;re sitting there , in your 70 trillion cells , the extra@@ cell@@ ular matrix sign@@ aling to your nucleus , the nucleus is sign@@ aling to your extra@@ cell@@ ular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and re@@ stor@@ ed .
we know that hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es have always happened in the past . &quot;
uganda has just discovered oil , in about the most dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous location on earth ; ghana has discovered oil ; gu@@ ine@@ a has got a huge new explo@@ itation of ir@@ on ore coming out of the ground .
but before we did the first experiments , we actually asked art ca@@ plan &apos;s team at the university of pennsylvania to under@@ take a re@@ view of what the ris@@ ks , the challenges , the eth@@ ics around creating new species in the laborat@@ ory were because it hadn &apos;t been done before .
and nobody cele@@ br@@ ates imitation the way &quot; dirty jobs &quot; guys know it has to be done .
and after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally re@@ wi@@ re the brains of his patients and create a hom@@ olog@@ ous spe@@ ech center in their right he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere to comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te for the left he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere &apos;s damage .
you &apos;ve got to do cars in the rain ; you &apos;ve got to do cars in the snow .
now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years .
and i don &apos;t mean most imag@@ in@@ ative use in politics -- i mean most imag@@ in@@ ative use ever .
so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man &apos;s problem pri@@ mar@@ ily -- which that was never true , but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 19@@ 50s and &apos; 60s , and it was in all the text@@ books .
you could look at nature as being like a cat@@ alog of products , and all of those have benef@@ ited from a 3.@@ 8@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ year research and development period .
in two weeks , they found him .
so , i wi@@ pe the pi@@ ge@@ on man@@ ure off one of the b@@ ells , and i look at it .
the cells looked better .
this past year , in 2009 , you can see that they &apos;re now raising about a four@@ th of a ch@@ ick , and some of these individuals are going more than 9@@ 00 kilome@@ ters away from their ne@@ sts .
are politi@@ cians making good decisions on my be@@ half ?
right ? and then i realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attribu@@ ted to me and i thought , oh , i said something , you know , in an interview .
here is a three-@@ wee@@ k-@@ old baby .
they su@@ ck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they dri@@ p feed the lower city .
so to look for a way to prevent angiogen@@ esis in cancer , i went back to look at cancer &apos;s caus@@ es .
and remember , we are only as great as our imagination , as big as our dream .
finally cat@@ ches up to itself , it advan@@ ces .
so i invented bur@@ la@@ p sa@@ cks , bun@@ ker spa@@ wn -- and putting the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um -- using stor@@ m blo@@ wn de@@ br@@ is , you can take these bur@@ la@@ p sa@@ cks and put them down@@ stream from a farm that &apos;s producing e@@ . col@@ i , or other wa@@ stes , or a fac@@ tory with chemical tox@@ ins , and it leads to hab@@ it@@ at re@@ stor@@ ation .
only this time , instead of the product being shaped by the wind , it was shaped by the human body .
i could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
i came to live it , and i am living it .
i tried to sand@@ wi@@ ch it in between talking too much in church , wi@@ sh@@ ing har@@ m to others , being mean to my si@@ sters .
to me , char@@ ity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hur@@ ts .
it &apos;s got little dres@@ sing rooms and c@@ ab@@ anas , where lots of interesting things went on , all summer long .
now , there &apos;s another part of that community which are the commercial bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , the ones who make their li@@ ve@@ lihood from bee@@ keeping alone .
you &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
i &apos;d like to play to you guys , if you &apos;re willing to be the first audience to hear it .
and for what was then a very small organization of just a few people , trying to even begin to think how we might t@@ ack@@ le that was an enormous challenge .
it creates some very serious al@@ er@@ ts .
basically , what they &apos;re doing is looking at biology as a programm@@ able system .
2.@@ 9 seconds .
our only chance of long-term survival is not to re@@ main l@@ ur@@ king on planet earth , but to spread out into space .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an itali@@ an pain@@ ter recogni@@ zed the la@@ p as a gre@@ cian temple , u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster@@ ed in fl@@ es@@ h and cl@@ oth .
so , let &apos;s make it right in our own back@@ y@@ ard .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
my green &#91; un@@ clear &#93; 25@@ ,000 pounds of veget@@ ables , i &apos;m growing organic citizens , engaged kids .
it looks like our table also can transform gender , too .
so the robot then fig@@ ures out what the fe@@ atures are .
in fact , the infe@@ cti@@ ous ag@@ ent of disease in this cancer is something al@@ together more sin@@ i@@ ster , and something that we hadn &apos;t really thought of before .
that goes down to 10,000 dollars per car , just for the cost of the par@@ king .
consciousness . i see all your faces .
so basically what i didn &apos;t tell you is that about 500 million years ago , organisms star@@ ter making materials , but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it .
a little bit of differenti@@ al , but not much .
for some reason i keep remember@@ ing that lady jan@@ e grey was que@@ en of england when she was only 15 .
this is about a place in london called k@@ ite@@ fl@@ yer &apos;s hill where i used to go and spend hours going &quot; when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? &quot;
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in per@@ u , the president of per@@ u said , &quot; we &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and boom , a little domin@@ o effect .
so she pulled up the c@@ d of the scan images , and look at all those hot spo@@ ts .
they would have been deeply dis@@ may@@ ed by today &apos;s dis@@ jun@@ ction between science and the rest of culture .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angel@@ ine .
it was just extraordinary .
also , if you think about it , demon@@ s always have bat wings , wh@@ ere@@ as birds , they typically -- or angel@@ s have bird wings .
and i was free for dinner , and i went out to dinner with the minister of fis@@ her@@ ies in ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i .
&quot; beyond the age of information is the age of choices . &quot;
why can &apos;t we have these kinds of conver@@ sations with our own el@@ ders and people who might be appro@@ aching this ?
there are the re@@ tail shops , the caf@@ es and the restaurants , and the community is this community of cop@@ tic chri@@ sti@@ ans , so you &apos;ll also find a church , along with the sc@@ or@@ es of religi@@ ous icon@@ ographi@@ es throughout the area , and also all the everyday services like the electron@@ ic re@@ pair shops , the bar@@ bers , everything .
so , a little bit of perspective -- about 10,000 years of perspective .
their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party .
but technology alone isn &apos;t enough .
and if you &apos;re going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to stop talking about sele@@ ctive pres@@ sur@@ es , &quot; you can take &quot; the orig@@ in of species &quot; and throw it out of the window , for it &apos;s about nothing else but sele@@ ctive pres@@ sur@@ es .
so let &apos;s ab@@ and@@ on the paradigm of let &apos;s search for the cool@@ est chemistry and then hopefully we &apos;ll ch@@ ase down the cost cur@@ ve by just making lots and lots of product .
these actually are sold as art@@ work .
it was dying well before he did , and now it &apos;s on its last legs .
what this means is that if you could shr@@ ink the earth to the size of a billi@@ ard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its moun@@ tain top@@ s and ca@@ ves and rain@@ forests , astron@@ au@@ ts and un@@ cont@@ ac@@ ted tri@@ bes and chimpanze@@ es , vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s , fire@@ flies , cho@@ col@@ ate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shr@@ ink that to the size of a billi@@ ard ball , it would be as smo@@ oth as a billi@@ ard ball , pres@@ um@@ ably a billi@@ ard ball with a s@@ light bul@@ ge around the middle .
and that is where i end .
this science is different , more general , than the mathema@@ tic@@ s-@@ based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
so we went there with a truck . this is a photo@@ bo@@ oth truck .
today it &apos;s less than 50 c@@ ents a day .
they didn &apos;t do this with a computer .
there were flexible , clear blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
and he said , &quot; you didn &apos;t have , until this moment , real compassion .
and if you look clo@@ sely at these bal@@ lot forms , you &apos;ll notice that the can@@ di@@ date list is in a different order on each one .
thank you .
we &apos;re not taking the bon@@ us yet .
i &apos;m going home for a mi@@ d@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on campus .
the radi@@ ologists were , in turn , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for prote@@ cting their own financial self-@@ interest .
and then you draw the conclusion the od@@ ds of w@@ inn@@ ing the lot@@ tery are 100 percent .
it exists . what is a s@@ no@@ b ?
she promis@@ ed to raise the issue with her community .
our school would show bill ny@@ e the science guy .
another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21@@ st century , we want to get away from the idea that power &apos;s always zero sum -- my gain is your loss and vice ver@@ sa .
it was at that moment , in that very small town of 3@@ 0,000 or so , that i truly appreci@@ ated the va@@ st@@ ness of the universe and the se@@ arch@@ ing we might do in it .
for hours afterwards , the sea was stre@@ wn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the sl@@ um .
so , we will have less phosphor@@ us , but we &apos;ll need to produce more food .
yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they &apos;re very good at this .
and this is indeed the charac@@ teri@@ stic of what we think of as the good life .
people who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or metaph@@ or@@ ical , cannot pass our exam@@ s , and we can never know what they know .
you weren &apos;t going to put toll@@ boo@@ ths around the city of london and open and shu@@ t those gates .
we could change the invisible c@@ ler@@ ks within the ki@@ o@@ s@@ ks , every week , but we could not change this cor@@ ru@@ pt practice .
and in south africa , they associ@@ ate happiness with ser@@ iti or community respect .
and the other one is more primi@@ tive than the other .
and they can la@@ ther , r@@ in@@ se , repe@@ at . and before you know it , you have a general sense of where everything is .
i have to tell you a little bit about my family .
and i didn &apos;t give the talk always . you did , and we had to watch you , and so forth .
yes , great . i see people going down like this .
in these partner@@ shi@@ ps , i have also learned that people tend to com@@ part@@ ment@@ alize themselves into it people , and movie star people , and scientists , but when we share nature , when we share our perspe@@ cti@@ ves about nature , we find a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
and after a year , we have 1,000 cars that are par@@ ked across fr@@ ance and 6@@ ,000 people who are members and e@@ ager to drive them .
it turns out , maybe not surpris@@ ingly , that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free .
now , 20@@ th-@@ century psych@@ ologists and soci@@ ologists were thinking about stran@@ gers , but they weren &apos;t thinking so dynam@@ ically about human relations , and they were thinking about stran@@ gers in the context of influ@@ encing practic@@ es .
this is a completely different example .
ok ? here we go .
then instead of del@@ eting those positive out@@ li@@ ers , what i inten@@ tionally do is come into a population like this one and say , why ?
it is , in fact , enorm@@ ously important . i &apos;ll explain to you why .
so , i know what you &apos;re thinking : &quot; that &apos;s a lot of work , isn &apos;t it ? isn &apos;t it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ? &quot;
we don &apos;t know what any of these sym@@ b@@ ols mean .
and after i came out of the clo@@ set , when she continued to say it , it made me fu@@ ri@@ ous .
if we do that , we really can make poverty history .
what i have in mind is : terrorism happens here ; we over@@ re@@ act to it .
people from all different kinds of discipl@@ ines , they think of themselves as only analy@@ tical .
to power the entire world with 50 percent wind , you would need about one percent of world land .
i &apos;m going to talk about two stories today .
would you mind taking the brain out , and i just want you to feel something .
you know , we have a fair@@ ly interesting situation right now .
just to put this in terms of generations , because people do find it hard to think of time , homo ere@@ ctu@@ s left africa 9@@ 0,000 generations ago .
and other f@@ m devices im@@ plan@@ ted in finger@@ tips , on cont@@ acting a surface , will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain , so that the person feels a sense of touch .
well , the single best way is to get them to understand that what they &apos;re being told is a whole lot of non@@ sense .
and i &apos;m here to tell you the em@@ per@@ or has no clo@@ th@@ es .
i told na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , &quot; that &apos;s a trick .
and there are more than 200 forma@@ ts , across 50 cities and to@@ w@@ ns of india .
i got in the water with 30 other le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als , and i never once had a sc@@ ary en@@ coun@@ ter .
and when i went back to follo@@ wing these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappe@@ ared al@@ together .
many years passed .
when birds can &apos;t fly , they become vulnerable .
i want you to imagine , right now , a broken relationship from many years ago .
there &apos;s been four billion years of organic , biological life .

there are 500 of these facili@@ ties producing active ingredients in china alone .
if you guys aren &apos;t already leaders in your community , you probably will be , and if there &apos;s anything i can give you that will tran@@ sc@@ end what i &apos;ve gotten from sk@@ at@@ e@@ boar@@ ding , the only things of meaning , i think , and of perman@@ ence , it &apos;s not f@@ ame , it &apos;s not all these things . what it is is that there &apos;s an in@@ trin@@ si@@ c value in creating something for the sa@@ ke of creating it , and better than that , because , man , i &apos;m 46 years old , or i &apos;ll be 46 , and how pa@@ thetic is that i &apos;m still sk@@ at@@ e@@ boar@@ ding , but there is — -- there is this beauty in dro@@ pping it into a community of your own making , and seeing it dis@@ per@@ sed , and seeing yo@@ unger , more tal@@ ented , just different talent , take it to levels you can never imagine , because that lives on . so thank you for your time .
i must have been 1@@ 9 and a half then , and it was love at first sight .
and when ki@@ bak@@ i got into power -- through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in ken@@ ya -- they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
but what ni@@ ck did was he brought back a story that went beyond the ol@@ d-@@ school method of just straight , &quot; isn &apos;t this an amazing world ? &quot;
and we were able to cross this line , called the un@@ can@@ ny valley , in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms .
it was a fair@@ y tale , and then we re@@ ti@@ red .
so what about with our approach , ad@@ ding the code ? and you can see that it &apos;s much better . not only can you tell that it &apos;s a baby &apos;s face , but you can tell that it &apos;s this baby &apos;s face , which is a really challenging task .
he had said , in janu@@ ary , that he would not sign a bill that granted tele@@ com im@@ m@@ unity for possibly war@@ r@@ ant@@ less sp@@ ying on american person@@ s .
it &apos;s exciting because we &apos;re natur@@ ally interested in other intelligent beings , and i think that &apos;s part of our hard@@ wir@@ ing .
did i wish to see him re@@ move them ?
we can start with mon@@ go@@ lia , or as some call it , min@@ e-@@ go@@ lia .
i have to do my carbon off@@ set in another way , like i do every time .
allo@@ wing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families , and the public fig@@ ures we have respe@@ cted in our history , just as abraham lincoln wanted to believe , really can live on , so long as we ple@@ dge to tell and to re@@ tell the stories of their lives .
but this is a simple sign@@ al , and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .
it &apos;s an underwater world we &apos;re all explor@@ ing together .
b@@ j : and you have to know that , when a male li@@ on is killed , it completely dis@@ rup@@ ts the whole pri@@ de .
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypo@@ thesis : i am my conne@@ ct@@ ome .
it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
they want to hun@@ ker down , they want to look to the future .
on average , it was just a completely poin@@ t@@ less exchange of money that i would re@@ gre@@ t .
so let me show you , i &apos;m going to start with the skelet@@ al structure , and i can add a few inter@@ n@@ al organs .
that you see , the hori@@ zon@@ tal ax@@ is is where you place your country .
thank you .
it wasn &apos;t . it was 192@@ 8 .
anyway , one tree is situ@@ ated right next to a beautiful coral re@@ e@@ f .
i work in global poverty .
now it &apos;s still in de@@ bt , but chris has managed , through his own sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out .
so you &apos;ve got food economy and local food at the top , you &apos;ve got greenhouse g@@ ases , solar and nuclear waste .
if you love nature , the best thing you can do is stay the he@@ ck away from it , move to a city , and the den@@ ser the better , and the den@@ ser cities like manhattan are the cities that per@@ form the best .
so when we did , we found some very surprising things .
it &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot;
there &apos;s one condition : you must write like crazy . like crazy !
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember p@@ ig@@ s . and each one of you assum@@ ed that if dogs on le@@ as@@ hes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on le@@ as@@ hes are more prob@@ able .
f@@ g : you &apos;ve all heard the frank l@@ loy@@ d w@@ right story , when the woman called and said , &quot; mr. w@@ right , i &apos;m sitting on the cou@@ ch and the water &apos;s po@@ uring in on my head . &quot;
so as i did this , and as i think many of us do this , we kind of buy our distance , we kind of buy our right to go on with our day .

i had access to him . i could study him , have him come to my home , get to know him , do psych@@ ological analysis to see , was he a good app@@ le or bad app@@ le .
that is to say , if something happened -- and i &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen , but i &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
the traditional thing would be to bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t right ?
and again , i get that feeling when we get a kno@@ ck on the door of our apartment in bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , and my sister and i find a deli@@ ver@@ y@@ man with a box of pizza that we didn &apos;t order .
civili@@ zations and cultures , which had been ignor@@ ed , which had no voice , which were not listen@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of represent@@ ation in this world .
turns out that it &apos;s a fail@@ ed ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation project .
my family ate one meal per day , at night .
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
think about that .
&quot; is it okay if i totally tr@@ ash your office ? &quot; it &apos;s a question el@@ yn sa@@ ks once asked her doctor , and it wasn &apos;t a jo@@ ke . a legal sch@@ ol@@ ar , in 2007 sa@@ ks came forward with her own story of schizop@@ hren@@ ia , controll@@ ed by drugs and therapy but ever@@ -@@ present . in this powerful talk , she as@@ ks us to see people with mental illness clearly , hon@@ est@@ ly and com@@ passion@@ ately .
i &apos;m going to become a cro@@ tch@@ ety old lady .
is it just the wind or a dangerous pre@@ dat@@ or ?
cri@@ tics of this project say , hang on .
we also have our very own dream team .
we used ultravio@@ let radiation to do that .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
and in this case , we &apos;re imag@@ ining inter@@ medi@@ ary robotic devices that can actually do some of that fron@@ t-@@ end work for us , to protect any potential life that we find .
restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most waste@@ ful industry in the world .
and i find this very much distur@@ bing when we &apos;re talking about what &apos;s going on right and wrong with democracy these days .
and it ke@@ ep@@ s forming until the universe is rough@@ ly about half the size it is now , in terms of its expan@@ sion .
que@@ erer than can in principle be supposed , or just que@@ erer than we can sup@@ pose , given the limit@@ ations of our brain &apos;s evolutionary app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p in middle world ?
and so we appro@@ ached this patient and asked if he would collabor@@ ate with us .
they also have their own news network on youtube with 3@@ 6@@ ,000 vie@@ wers at the moment .
i started to speak with the community , and i could convince everybody , and we could start to work .
this was an early col@@ lage com@@ ic by a fellow named j@@ ason le@@ x .
i get on . i tend to be a little bit vi@@ gil@@ ant when i get on the subway .
that &apos;s like , you know , &quot; life su@@ cks . &quot; who wants to talk that way ?
do you turn off the international spi@@ got of life support and risk two million civili@@ an lives ?
so we &apos;ll need to be very care@@ ful around him . don &apos;t let him get you .
i fell in love with mathematics from the earli@@ est of ages .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s le@@ tter to me , telling me to mar@@ ry the woman i first mar@@ ried when i was 20 .
i hope you &apos;ll all wear them .
so once the physi@@ cian ver@@ i@@ fi@@ es that the focus spo@@ t is on the tar@@ get he has cho@@ sen , then we move to per@@ form a ful@@ l-@@ energy ab@@ lation like you see here .
because it &apos;s quite hard to wat@@ er@@ proof buildings anyway , but if you say you &apos;re going to dri@@ ll 6@@ 6@@ ,000 hol@@ es in it -- we had quite a time .
again , a bit counter@@ intui@@ tive .
another is vi@@ a the ap@@ i .
it was a myth@@ ical past .
eric gil@@ er wants to un@@ t@@ angle our wired lives with c@@ ab@@ le-@@ free electric power . here , he covers what this sci@@ -@@ f@@ i tech off@@ ers , and demo@@ s mit &apos;s break@@ through version , wi@@ tri@@ city -- a ne@@ ar-@@ to-@@ market in@@ vention that may soon re@@ charge your cell phone , car , pac@@ e@@ maker .
so how would you use this device ?
and then his went on the ground .
this is a police photo . that &apos;s actually my car .
it taught me -- it gave me a greater appreci@@ ation , an understanding for the present moment .
do the mon@@ keys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be ris@@ ky and try to get a ris@@ ky , but big , bon@@ us , but risk the possibility of getting no bon@@ us .
kb : thank you .
here &apos;s a giant flying repli@@ ca of a p@@ ter@@ osau@@ r that has no tail .
well , that got us a little angry .
it &apos;s not going to be easy .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
where do women get f@@ at ?
and that &apos;s their problem ; we &apos;re eating them to death .

in addition to cu@@ ta@@ ways , we also explain physics .

so now when you know what to expect , let &apos;s give you the story .
and i didn &apos;t know where he was going with it at first .
on the first ro@@ und , people give about half of the money that they can .
you decided to build a space company .
what &apos;s next : antar@@ c@@ tica .

but my thesis is , open-@@ source security is about international , inter@@ agency , priv@@ at@@ e-@@ public connection pulled together by this idea of strate@@ gic communication on the internet .
because when the thing gets prev@@ ented in chicago with the three million dead that per@@ ver@@ ts our political system beyond all recogni@@ tion , these are the guys who are going to kill them first .
and what i loved about this image of the comp@@ ass was that i felt like it en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated both of these ideas in one simple image .
but then i met a biolog@@ ist , and now i think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
now , what &apos;s important about what these people are doing is that they &apos;re beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment .
and almost univers@@ ally , am@@ ong@@ st all the kids , they were really psych@@ ologi@@ cally da@@ ma@@ ged by having been made fun of , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed , picked on and been re@@ je@@ cted .
are they feeling it from their heart , or is it just a cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l thing ?
all around us , still cl@@ um@@ si@@ ly dri@@ f@@ ting about in its pri@@ me@@ val soup of culture , is another replic@@ ator .
however cancer is con@@ stra@@ ined by living inside our bodies , and its continued growth , its spre@@ ading through our bodies and eating away at our tis@@ su@@ es , leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself .
that &apos;s the beauty of this economy .
after all , aging is not a piece of ca@@ ke .

i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we &apos;ve lost -- actually , we &apos;ve taken , we &apos;ve e@@ aten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral re@@ ef@@ s have disappe@@ ared ; why a myster@@ ious de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in large areas of the pac@@ i@@ fic should conc@@ ern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should conc@@ ern you .
what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate ?

and i would personally say that we have to craft new political reali@@ ties , not only in places like india , afghanistan , ken@@ ya , paki@@ stan , what have you , but here at home as well .
which i &apos;m gla@@ d you liked , but they did not like that at all .
all these people that had sort of flexible da@@ ily hours and an interest in the english word -- i hope to have an interest in the english language , but i &apos;m not speaking it well right now .
so der@@ e@@ ck turned on the he@@ ater f@@ an in the car -- very innovative .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
freu@@ d would say , &quot; the fact that you &apos;re at all concern@@ ed reve@@ als your underlying sexual inse@@ curity . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blo@@ cks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the ci@@ vi@@ c square and how to really make use of this proper@@ ty .
now those of you who have been to i@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen top@@ kap@@ i pal@@ ace , which was the res@@ iden@@ ce of ot@@ to@@ man sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 400 years .
but how does it happen ? did you see him turning pages in the score ?
now , when you were a young boy in this school , what were your thou@@ ghts , like what did you think you could become ?
in reality , these animals have no ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al counter@@ part ; they &apos;re unique in the world .
there is no better way to show people that you &apos;re not serious than to t@@ ie up everything you have to say about eth@@ ics into a little pac@@ ka@@ ge with a bo@@ w and con@@ sign it to the marg@@ ins as an eth@@ ics course .

we need to create a movement among all these people that i meet in my tra@@ vels -- you probably meet , too -- who want to join up , in some way , and re@@ claim their faith , which they feel , as i say , has been hi@@ jac@@ ked .
and in order to introduce you to that , i &apos;ve got something here that i &apos;m going to un@@ v@@ eil , which is one of the great mar@@ vels of the modern age .
they &apos;re ner@@ v@@ ous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero toler@@ ance policies .
because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are recei@@ ving the stream through our internet .
and your ide@@ al dad is somebody who is tough but gent@@ le .

and she refer@@ red me to an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on , also free .
and i say all this just to stress how very ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned and stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward my background is , because when i go to h@@ ong kon@@ g or sy@@ dney or vancou@@ ver , most of the kids i meet are much more international and multi@@ -@@ cultu@@ red than i am .
and that will have to a@@ wait the arri@@ val , back at en@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , of the space@@ cra@@ f@@ ts , hopefully some time in the near future , specifically equi@@ pped to address that particular question .
i think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell you what &apos;s really important and what &apos;s not , and sand@@ y made me realize that our devices and their conne@@ ctivity matter to us right up there with food and shel@@ ter .
in the u.k. we have the national institute for clinical excell@@ ence , nice .
that &apos;s what david has , and it &apos;s important to understand that that sling is not a sl@@ ing@@ shot .

and we cli@@ m@@ bed up and we got to the very top , and we &apos;re on the edge , on this preci@@ pi@@ ce , ro@@ land disappe@@ ars into the sul@@ fu@@ r smo@@ ke at the vol@@ can@@ o at the other end , and i &apos;m up there alone on this incredible preci@@ pi@@ ce .

i have the wr@@ ist ro@@ tation that goes -- and it can go all the way around .
at least 60 percent of the homes on the reser@@ vation are in@@ fest@@ ed with black m@@ old .
i was crazy when i decided to start it , but i &apos;m in the middle of it now .
does anybody know when the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e was invented ?
and of course , we may be wrong -- this hasn &apos;t all been pe@@ er re@@ vie@@ wed , we &apos;re in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far , it seems good .
within nine years , we had multi@@ pli@@ ed that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times into 10@@ 8 million dollars after all expen@@ ses for aids services .
for every 400 movies made in hollywood , there are 1@@ 1,000 now made por@@ n videos .
it &apos;s next to nothing . especially designed for me .
with every pas@@ sing year , i realize how much more powerful the idea of compu@@ tation really is .
it &apos;s a very bl@@ ur@@ ry line , and it &apos;s getting more bl@@ ur@@ ry all the time as we make even more ob@@ serva@@ tions .
you &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fi@@ ber of your being .
so let me show you a little of that .
so i started to go around the world finding the best and bri@@ ght@@ est scientists i could at universities whose collective disco@@ ver@@ ies have the chance to take us there , and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas .
all across the bor@@ e@@ al , we &apos;re bl@@ essed with this incredible ab@@ undance of wet@@ lands .
the longer i sta@@ yed in the hospital , the si@@ cker i became , and the more expensive it became , and this happens to millions of people around the world every year .
now , i was taken by in@@ spe@@ ctor bri@@ an can@@ ter@@ a , of the royal can@@ adi@@ an moun@@ ted police , to a ca@@ vern@@ ous war@@ e@@ house east of vancou@@ ver to see some of the goo@@ ds which are regul@@ arly con@@ fis@@ cated by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sen@@ ding it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market for b@@ .@@ c. bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s mark@@ et@@ ed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
jordan bun@@ ker , who had had no experience with chemistry until then , read this paper and re@@ produced the experiment at his maker space using only off@@ -@@ the-@@ shel@@ f sub@@ stances and tools .
this is a positive sa@@ mp@@ le .
well that &apos;s not surprising , but we also asked them to ju@@ dge them on hon@@ est@@ y , intelligence , friend@@ lin@@ ess , violence .
no so@@ on@@ er was it proposed than re@@ form@@ ers in ni@@ ger@@ ia adop@@ ted it , pus@@ hed it and published the re@@ ven@@ ues in the paper .
and i fac@@ ed a whole new set of challenges .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
other people make the op@@ posite trip .
mar@@ co temp@@ est : now tesla &apos;s brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
because the challenge is not losing weight , it &apos;s actually keeping it off .
by about 18@@ 5@@ 2 , they &apos;re thinking , &quot; am i the stu@@ pi@@ dest person on earth by not rus@@ hing to california ? &quot; and they start to decide they are .
do they do it by inter@@ lo@@ cking ? that &apos;s kind of a like a vel@@ cro@@ -@@ like thing .
it &apos;s moved up again . the groups are more frag@@ mented .
and if you &apos;re in the half-@@ mile radi@@ us of where this bom@@ b went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
i actually ran out , i spent too much money on my road trip for the sa@@ v@@ ings that i had to take my year off , so i had to , i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really ne@@ at project .
she &apos;s some other woman . she &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or . &quot;
it &apos;s taken for granted that chinese fac@@ tor@@ ies are op@@ pres@@ sive , and that it &apos;s our desire for cheap goo@@ ds that makes them so .
this is one of their fo@@ under@@ s , g@@ ert sch@@ a@@ eff@@ er .
he was strug@@ gl@@ ing to explain something to me : a beautiful experiment that uses las@@ ers to cool down matter .
i went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
if you look in areas where these sal@@ ts are completely available , the price is low or zero , these deaths still continue ab@@ ated .
i haven &apos;t invented anything at all ; it &apos;s a biot@@ echn@@ ology that has exi@@ sted for 450 million years .
this is it . this is the hir@@ sh@@ hor@@ n -- so a 2@@ 3@@ 0-@@ foot@@ -@@ diam@@ e@@ ter con@@ crete dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ t designed in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s by gor@@ don b@@ uns@@ haft .
so , i say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of re@@ aching this r@@ hr mi@@ le@@ stone , robust human re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation .
well , there are some kind of execu@@ tive decisions , but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody .
specifically , we use these six design dire@@ cti@@ ves , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ -@@ focused design , it &apos;s not about designing for cli@@ ents anymore .
well we took the manus@@ cri@@ pt , and we decided to image it in x-ray flu@@ ores@@ cence ima@@ ging .
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there &apos;s nobody out there trying to collect it parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic .
this is in 1960 .
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
it &apos;s a total media cir@@ cus .
these out@@ si@@ ghts ran@@ ged from the tri@@ val to the profound , from the m@@ und@@ an@@ e to the hu@@ mor@@ ous .
all women in gand@@ o will open their clo@@ th@@ es like that and give me the last penny .
the bus was done with a car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning x-ray machine , which is used on the bor@@ ders between countries , looking for contr@@ ab@@ and and illegal im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts .
and with the 99 , that is what we a@@ im to do .
and ultimately , the my@@ st@@ ical or sometimes called the &quot; an@@ a@@ go@@ gi@@ cal &quot; level .
these are being la@@ y@@ ered , one layer at a time , first the bone , we fill in the g@@ aps with c@@ arti@@ lage .
i called her up .
but here , i only want to make the point that the ele@@ gan@@ ce of darwin@@ ism is cor@@ ro@@ sive to religion precisely because it is so elegant , so par@@ si@@ mon@@ ious , so powerful , so econom@@ ically powerful .
and it &apos;s really difficult to re@@ call , in a normal fra@@ me of mind , just how good life can be at its best .

so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it bran@@ ches and bran@@ ches down to di@@ stances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little ro@@ dent .
so out went the green sc@@ ru@@ bs and in came the pol@@ ye@@ ster and fl@@ oral prin@@ ts .
it &apos;s kind of like you have all these fan@@ cy sensor@@ s , and inside your brain is a little security gu@@ ard .
history is not linear .
now , fast forward two years , to early 2007 .
now , since that time , we &apos;ve actually been through an extraordinary boom , the lon@@ gest boom ever in the history of this country .
what &apos;s happening now , in this field called bi@@ om@@ imi@@ cry , is that people are beginning to remember that organisms , other organisms , the rest of the natural world , are doing things very similar to what we need to do .
and i think it &apos;s fantastic that we are today experi@@ encing ted@@ x in a theater for the first time because i think we really o@@ we to the theater a big thanks .
it &apos;s really a time machine .
it &apos;s almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-@@ force , back at the beginning of time .
i now cover sy@@ ria , and i started reporting it because i believed that it needs to be done .
and they &apos;ve been actually quite successful in getting better de@@ als because most of them are getting a ra@@ w deal .

now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of inc@@ enti@@ ves .
that &apos;s the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a da@@ v@@ os after@@ no@@ on about four years ago .
so , let &apos;s switch it on . but to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .

and ... well , i guess i could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
now this was a really exciting experience for me .
you know , this is some tough stuff .
lying is an attemp@@ t to bridge that gap , to connect our wi@@ sh@@ es and our fan@@ tas@@ ies about who we wish we were , how we wish we could be , with what we &apos;re really like .

if we are to shift paradig@@ ms , if we are to make break@@ through@@ s , if we are to destroy my@@ ths , we need to create an environment in which exper@@ t ideas are bat@@ tling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , di@@ verse , dis@@ cor@@ d@@ ant , her@@ e@@ tical vie@@ ws into the discussion , fe@@ ar@@ less@@ ly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surro@@ und@@ ing ourselves by di@@ ver@@ gent , dis@@ cor@@ d@@ ant , her@@ e@@ tical vie@@ ws .
my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times when the west has tried to do it themselves , and we haven &apos;t succe@@ e@@ ded .

i suspe@@ ct , actually , that the evolutionary biologi@@ sts probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to categ@@ ori@@ ze new things very , very quickly .
so progress on this &quot; let &apos;s make it re@@ us@@ able , &quot; how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw .
and they have absolutely amazing education systems .

you know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — — an aw@@ k@@ ward interaction , or a s@@ mile , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ shake .
not many people like che@@ cking boxes .
the rema@@ ining value of older people that i &apos;ll men@@ tion invol@@ ves recogni@@ zing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than yo@@ unger people .

i would like to see or@@ ac@@ le take up that , or some other technological geni@@ uses work on this .
now the first step in solving any problem is ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .

he &apos;s working for the exhibi@@ tion on a whole series of doll@@ s that explain to children where babies come from today .
and like all parents since the da@@ wn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bo@@ whe@@ ad whales migra@@ te north each spr@@ ing@@ time .
now what does that mean ?
but this is a space that is actually fil@@ led with people , dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died voices , and out of that ambi@@ ent environment , when people come close to your own body zone , very close , they appear to you as represent@@ ations .
in a minute we &apos;re going to move to a two-@@ orbital con@@ figuration , and you &apos;re going to notice a pul@@ sing .
we took him to the mr@@ i machine , we took him to the c@@ at scan@@ ner , we took this day-@@ old child and gave him over for an ar@@ teri@@ al blood draw .
no , it &apos;s worse than that .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
they can listen and join the conversation .
okay , so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like .
what does that fo@@ cal leng@@ th do ?
we have got to go beyond this paradigm of isol@@ ated speci@@ ali@@ sts doing parts care to multi@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary teams doing person care .
and i &apos;ve come to the belief -- this is my 12@@ th year doing this research -- that vulner@@ ability is our most accurate measu@@ re@@ ment of courage -- to be vulnerable , to let ourselves be seen , to be honest .
grand@@ ma can lo@@ g into that robot and play hi@@ de-@@ and-@@ go@@ -@@ see@@ k with her grand@@ daughter for fif@@ te@@ en minutes every single night , when other@@ wise she might only be able to get to see her grand@@ daughter once or twice a year .
swe@@ den achiev@@ ed a low child mortality because we started early .
and we dri@@ ll@@ ed in the ross sea .
as i realized , just like with many many things in my life that i actually love , i ada@@ pt to it .
we are being watched .
we &apos;ve had a different approach .
i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year .
so this was not what they call a laborat@@ or@@ y-@@ scale experiment , and they wouldn &apos;t have liked it at my college .
and we &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the field . it &apos;s been a fantastic amount of work .
that wasn &apos;t being asked .
it &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
and the reason for doing so , at the center of this photograph , is lin@@ us pau@@ ling . about six months before , he proposed the alpha heli@@ cal structure for proteins . and in doing so , he ban@@ ished the man out on the right , sir la@@ wr@@ ence bra@@ g@@ g , who was the ca@@ ven@@ dis@@ h professor .
plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communic@@ ators .
and then what happened ?
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the ba@@ th@@ room .
and i knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that i want to learn more about . so i did .
and i did , and we ended up nam@@ ing it du@@ ter@@ im@@ b@@ ere , meaning &quot; to go forward with enthusias@@ m . &quot; and while we were doing it , i realized that there weren &apos;t a lot of businesses that were vi@@ able and started by women , and so maybe i should try to run a business , too .
half the states would run out of hospital be@@ ds in the first week , maybe two weeks .
they didn &apos;t get in as much trouble . they were better students .
so , the wind is now coming from the nor@@ the@@ ast out of india , across the indian ocean , this way towards africa .
and if , however , you are dete@@ cted very early , diagno@@ sed early , treatment can start , and even in hi@@ v-@@ posi@@ tives , it makes sense .
imagine making it free , so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge , and imagine using information technology so that you can up@@ date this content , improve it , play with it , on a ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale that &apos;s more on the order of seconds instead of years .
both of these design for the assu@@ mption that people like to create and we want to share .
both models improve .
so there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does .
and this is fantastic . and it &apos;s so temp@@ ting to think that it &apos;s all about me .
you have to fight for what you believe . you don &apos;t always win everything you want to win . but you can ste@@ er the process .
we realized that we actually don &apos;t know everything , and that nature is so un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able , we have to be open at all times .
and on top of that , now we have a whole ple@@ th@@ ora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for min@@ ing cam@@ ps , mobile you@@ th ho@@ st@@ els , right down to the world c@@ up and the olymp@@ ics .
and we see the angl@@ es of the r@@ ings at different angl@@ es , there .
this is my global public de@@ bt clock , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 3@@ 2 trillion and coun@@ ting .
hack@@ ath@@ ons and ma@@ sha@@ th@@ ons and working with data to build apps is an intelli@@ gi@@ ble way for people to engage and partici@@ pate , like the jury is , but we &apos;re going to need lots more things like it .
that is the most p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic number you can have .
but we &apos;ll make huge invest@@ ments in your training and development , and we &apos;ll give you an extraordinary community of pe@@ ers . &quot;
and la@@ en@@ ne@@ c thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the ch@@ est or listen to the ab@@ d@@ omen using what he called &quot; the cy@@ lin@@ der . &quot;
this is not a feeling .
and you just , literally , have to send little nuclear fac@@ tor@@ ies up there that go@@ b@@ ble up the ir@@ on oxide on the surface of mars and sp@@ it out the oxygen .
we &apos;re flying through 2,000 lat@@ ti@@ ce of atoms -- oxygen , hydro@@ gen and zin@@ c .
again , if you &apos;re squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to watch .
that led to a whole series of other campaig@@ ns in japan , and i &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in japan that &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed in@@ corre@@ ctly , even though they &apos;re still s@@ elling whale meat , which i believe they shouldn &apos;t .
that person next to you is a bro@@ ther , is a sister .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
think of the allo@@ sphere as a large , dynam@@ ically v@@ ar@@ ying digital micro@@ scop@@ e that &apos;s connected to a super@@ computer .
two young scientists break down pla@@ stics with bacteria
that was , of course , the birth of the chicago board of trade , which is the most famous com@@ modi@@ ty exchange in the world .
become a cat@@ aly@@ st of change . teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
let me give just you an example to back up that last statement .
everything is everything .
so this is the first sort of step into using that in@@ sight into what makes us human beings , turning it into a tool , and trying to gain new insi@@ ghts into mental illness .
it &apos;s the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to k@@ yle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
so we asked ourselves , can the babies take statistics on a brand new language ?
as we ne@@ ared , angry crow@@ ds attac@@ ked our tru@@ cks and st@@ oned them , by hundreds of people all over the place .
isa@@ ac is ki@@ ck@@ in &apos; ass . man , he looks like a rock star .

so we bre@@ d flies whose brains were more or less rand@@ om@@ ly pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed with cells that were light addres@@ s@@ able .
and they would say , you know , &quot; move ! next ! &quot;
today , their share has more than dou@@ bled to above 20 percent .
yeah , i know !
but here &apos;s what he says about why they don &apos;t do that .
an an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous admini@@ str@@ ator was basically inv@@ iting people to join the page , and there was no plan .
but it &apos;s a bro@@ ad and very de@@ lic@@ ate subject , so i have to limit myself .
and we sat in sil@@ ence for that brie@@ f moment , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really tal@@ ented . &quot;
that cro@@ w enjo@@ ys a temporary mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly on pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
a few of these . this is a@@ ti@@ ll@@ a the hen .
and this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply satis@@ fying to me .
&quot; okay , great . &quot;
it was like vis@@ iting a more inno@@ cent time on the planet .
if you go look at their website today , they &apos;ll actually list these speci@@ men@@ s , saying , the rest was lost in a fire .
there &apos;s musi@@ cal lab@@ els .
i wanted to be an astron@@ aut , so i &apos;ve constantly followed what are the tools available to monit@@ or earth from ou@@ ter space -- and that we have incredible tools like we &apos;ve been learning about , in terms of being able to follow tag@@ ged species throughout their life@@ -@@ cy@@ cles in the open ocean .
because there &apos;s a lot of money in sand@@ al@@ wo@@ ods .
what would it be like to meet fre@@ der@@ ick dou@@ glass ? &quot;
all the bran@@ ches of the trees , the leaves that come down and they take months and months under the water , go to the ri@@ vers , and main@@ tain our source , main@@ tain our ri@@ vers .
so , i wanted to do something special today .
it &apos;s very short and only in one direction .
they &apos;re recogni@@ z@@ ably schools , but they look different .
that &apos;s worth men@@ tioning .
we tried to do the same thing by negoti@@ ating industr@@ y-@@ right de@@ als with the soft drink and the s@@ n@@ ack food industry to cut the cal@@ or@@ ic and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
le@@ h@@ man brothers goes down , the whole lot collap@@ ses .
therefore i believe it should not be cool .
if you don &apos;t think that way , well , you have a lot of company in the history of western philosoph@@ y , because the ti@@ dy idea , you know , people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed it .
it &apos;s just symbo@@ li@@ s@@ m .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very in@@ effective .
and one more cli@@ mber should have died that day , but didn &apos;t , and that &apos;s bec@@ k wea@@ thers .
but some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things .
it &apos;s called op@@ to-@@ isol@@ ator .
intensive far@@ ming is de@@ ple@@ ting so@@ ils .
he had a bra@@ chi@@ al a@@ vul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the arm was paraly@@ zed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated .
how small can neurons get ? well , look at this interesting inse@@ ct .
sher@@ e@@ en el fe@@ ki : po@@ p culture in the arab world
rory , you men@@ tioned li@@ b@@ ya at the end .
and now we &apos;ve got the words , and we can apply the special sau@@ ce : the trans@@ lation .
it was phenomen@@ al , and we felt gr@@ at@@ eful that she tru@@ sted us to that ex@@ tent .
there &apos;s a bubble .
great story is the art of letting go .
d@@ r : thank you . v@@ c : thank you .
it &apos;s too ris@@ k-@@ a@@ verse .
for the first time , american consum@@ ers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves .
and he &apos;s right .
t@@ ania lun@@ a : how a penny made me feel like a million@@ ai@@ re
and they say these things as if it &apos;s okay .
and the machine would main@@ tain synchr@@ oni@@ zation throughout .
ten percent of what we spend on healthcare , as i said earlier , is on o@@ bes@@ ity , and it &apos;s going to double .
they were the least mach@@ o people i &apos;ve ever met , but they made my day .
yes , you totally re@@ ver@@ sed your security policy .
and the other dimen@@ sion is : are they what they say they are to others ?
and everybody ste@@ pped back a little and said , you know , we ought to inv@@ est in this sh@@ it , because wh@@ o@@ ever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a domin@@ ant position , at least in the military , and probably in all kind of economic ways .
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day , and they were saying there &apos;s this great image of the que@@ en sitting outside willi@@ am hill .
this was truly a revolution in surgery .
in our imagination , it has to be light .
we want men between 20 and 50 . &quot;
when you make the claim , in fact , that something on the internet is going to be good for democracy , you often get this reaction .
and third , you can create your own t@@ ours -- you can share them with friends , you can create them with friends -- and that &apos;s the part that i think i &apos;m most excited about because i think that at heart , we are all story@@ t@@ ell@@ ers .
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social net@@ working to express their stories , share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices .
leaving something in@@ complete makes it interesting , and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth . &quot;
okay , so now we analy@@ zed the structure , so how does this rel@@ ate to the control ?
the trick@@ ster has a mind that is prepared for the un@@ prepared .
four years earlier , when i was one , after the cher@@ no@@ by@@ l accident , the rain came down black , and my sister &apos;s hair fell out in cl@@ um@@ ps , and i spent nine months in the hospital .
it &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
and we &apos;re a pretty small st@@ af@@ f , which is me .
the sun is a very important cu@@ e in the sky for them .
i call this process &quot; patter@@ ni@@ city &quot; -- that is , the ten@@ den@@ cy to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaning@@ less noise .
one thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater .
i want you to demand it .
and it becomes this dangerous cycle .
it was looking like the fro@@ zen region , literally a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator , and there are only two types of me@@ als there : ste@@ ak , which stands for a mu@@ bar@@ ak , ben ali@@ -@@ type of military police di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship , or a po@@ ta@@ to , which stands for te@@ hr@@ an types of the@@ o@@ cra@@ cies .
india is the smaller of the two countries , and yet it had a longer system of ra@@ il@@ ways until the late 199@@ 0s .
people &apos;s de@@ mean@@ or changes when they go in there .
it didn &apos;t look like it was going to work .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
it helped gand@@ hi k@@ ick the bri@@ ts from india .
but , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper .
it brought us hope .
i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face , and in the he@@ at of the desert , i was free@@ zing cold .
you take k@@ ate , i &apos;ll take sal ; we &apos;ll both have a johnson gal .
so even if somebody made the small@@ po@@ x genome , that dna itself would not cause infe@@ ctions .
they said , &quot; these two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; grand@@ mothers ? &quot; the minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening .
and it is my con@@ ten@@ tion that the man@@ ner in which we edu@@ cate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent .
bro@@ c@@ col@@ i is not a chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is origin@@ ally an itali@@ an vegetable .
i think it was good ad@@ vice .
they have a national en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted radio communic@@ ations system .
now , i don &apos;t know what you think , but i think this is a pretty stupid decision , because what you &apos;ve done is just made a permanent memor@@ ial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever .
the walls are totally made out of comp@@ res@@ sed cla@@ y blo@@ cks from gand@@ o .
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the up@@ per@@ -@@ strat@@ o@@ sphere to an al@@ titude of 40 km .
these are the classic conditions that create re@@ gre@@ t .
after alex@@ ander , the other emp@@ ir@@ es , baby@@ l@@ on dec@@ lines , falls into ru@@ ins , and all the tra@@ ces of the great baby@@ lon@@ ian em@@ pi@@ re are lost -- until 18@@ 7@@ 9 when the cy@@ lin@@ der is discovered by a british museum exhibi@@ tion dig@@ ging in baby@@ l@@ on .
and as a teacher of medicine , as a student myself , i was so inspired by that story .
and i just think that it &apos;s interesting that the idea of using re@@ al-@@ world cr@@ as@@ hes , which is very much something that econom@@ ists think would be the right thing to do , is something that scientists don &apos;t actually , usually think -- they would rather use a laborat@@ ory , a very im@@ perfect science of looking at the du@@ m@@ mi@@ es , than actually 30 years of data of what we &apos;ve seen with children and with car se@@ ats .
how do you know ?
so you must have pati@@ ence .
we got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we pre@@ paid them .
where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .
and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace span@@ ning 2@@ 7 countries and 450 million people .
the psych@@ o mil@@ t question is , was it a good idea ?
as hu@@ bert was talking over lunch , as we sort of engaged in conversation , talked about this , talked about cities .
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to ac@@ knowledge that islam , as interpre@@ ted by a very , very small , extremely radi@@ cal group of people , was a preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a con@@ sequence , at one degre@@ e of re@@ move , the preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
so , this is her leg@@ acy , and i think that my call to action to all of you is : you know , think about blogs , think about what they are , think about what you &apos;ve thought of them , and then actually do it , because it &apos;s something that is really going to change our lives .
food is as important as energy , as security , as the environment .
and the fellow said , &quot; well , if it &apos;s large enough , there ought to be cam@@ els there . &quot;
j@@ on@@ a@@ than dr@@ or@@ i : every po@@ llen gra@@ in has a story
until the day my father died , he was frustrated about missing these sh@@ ots .
there is no secre@@ tary of everything else .
r@@ hin@@ o &apos;s the common cold , and you all know what polio is , and you can see that these sig@@ nat@@ ures are dist@@ in@@ ct .
you can do it right now . my kids play co@@ w all the time .
and you can see , we started making a building together .
growth took off in china . the chinese started cat@@ ching up very quickly with the united states .
and i will talk on , is this possible ?
it &apos;s a different shape , but other than that it &apos;s the same basic limit@@ ation .
there &apos;s only where it is rela@@ tive to everything else that is .
and when they reached central asia , they reached what was effectively a ste@@ ppe super-@@ highway , a gras@@ s@@ land super-@@ highway .
nobody thin@@ ks there &apos;s opportunity .
and he was writing his blog one day , and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks .
if you talk to someone today in america about sexual activity , you &apos;ll find pretty soon you &apos;re not just talking about sexual activity .
we can &apos;t susta@@ in this without the measure of our success really changing the fa@@ te of the species in the yellow and the red .
and , it sm@@ elt like bur@@ nt c@@ and@@ y .
my grandmother was a home@@ maker .
now normally , these would be on different si@@ des of the planet or of the internet , but i &apos;ve put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting .
finally , i want to get actually to my vision , or in fact , to my dream .
it actually impro@@ ves it .
it &apos;s not enough to say you have two no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates from the re@@ public of liber@@ ia when your girls &apos; kids are totally out there and no hope , or seem@@ ingly no hope .
this is bu@@ ster setting up a pul@@ l-@@ up machine at the office of his new star@@ tu@@ p hab@@ it labs , where they &apos;re trying to build up other appli@@ cations like health month for people .
this was me running around in the back garden mi@@ d-@@ summer .
because what it does is allow a conver@@ gen@@ ce like we &apos;ve never had before .
so today &apos;s reality is that if we get si@@ ck , the message is we will treat your symptom@@ s , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
law@@ yers take cases on contin@@ gen@@ cy with the hope of a big share of a big se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment by a sym@@ pa@@ thetic jury , because this patient really ended up b@@ ad@@ ly .
so now , while you &apos;re thinking about that let &apos;s move to a second task .
in the heart of this ecosystem is the very anti@@ thesis of all of these values that we &apos;ve been talking about , and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be can@@ adi@@ ans .
but she actually used these on smo@@ oth sur@@ faces -- two of them -- to climb up , and pull her@@ self up .
let me try to take this one step further .
in other words , maybe the pleas@@ ures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering .
i started to learn classic bal@@ let , jazz dance , ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics and other things to make my performance better .
edu@@ c@@ ating the poor is more than just a numbers game , says shu@@ kl@@ a bo@@ se . she tells the story of her gro@@ und@@ breaking par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma humanity foundation , which brings hope to india &apos;s sl@@ ums by looking past the da@@ un@@ ting statistics and foc@@ using on treating each child as an individual .
it takes hard work , often behind the scen@@ es .
i said to her , &quot; you should do an experiment .
so that &apos;s the concept here for how we think this life exten@@ sion ability exists .
then he said , &quot; do you have ga@@ ff@@ er &apos;s tape ? &quot;
and those are some of the pictures that -- something was good about the bur@@ nt pictures .
you set a couple of bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y conditions , like gravity , the surface ten@@ sion , den@@ sity , etc . , and then you press &quot; ex@@ ec@@ ute , &quot; and ma@@ gi@@ cally , the universe produ@@ ces you a perfect ball lens .
defin@@ itely moving towards the land@@ ing tar@@ get .
if anybody wants to see some s@@ lei@@ ght of hand later on , i &apos;ll be outside .
the difference is this : a market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organi@@ zing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for s@@ ale .
for example , what if i turn the star@@ fish by a si@@ x@@ th of a turn , and then a third of a turn ?
we &apos;re all effectively part of an extended african family .
so we have this thing called ambi@@ ent inti@@ macy .
the position of women , how clo@@ sely they keep to the nuclear family , are on op@@ posite ends of the po@@ les in terms of the rich developed world .
crea@@ tively speaking , it &apos;s just a phenomen@@ al thing .
i &apos;m doing a building in swi@@ tzer@@ land , bas@@ el , which is an office building for a fur@@ ni@@ ture company .
but this is not an ancient conflict .
think about the infrastructure to build it .
but i had to go up@@ sta@@ irs , this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old bal@@ con@@ y , so it was incredibly hot , small and light , and i had to lie there . it was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
and i thought , go figure .
but no one ever consi@@ dered that they might be more clo@@ sely related .
it &apos;s like the guy who goes to the doctor and says , &quot; doctor , it hur@@ ts when i do this . &quot;
but if i could ask you to do one thing , it &apos;s not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just imagine that , although we all understand somehow that it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able that we use our 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ po@@ und machine , which can go 60 miles an hour , that can bring you everywhere you want to go , and somehow it &apos;s also what we used for the last mile , and it &apos;s broken , and it doesn &apos;t work .
we are here today because &#91; the &#93; united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .
now , you may ask about these kids .
so , chemistry is domin@@ ated by the electro@@ magnetic force .
but now , we have a different kind of com@@ ic .
ss : so , then ai@@ me@@ e makes it to the 199@@ 6 paraly@@ mp@@ ics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down -- it &apos;s a big deal .
and let me show you why by conver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d-@@ time digital technology .
now the no@@ vel took place on a university campus in boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than tur@@ k@@ ish characters , but i understood what my cri@@ tic was looking for .
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
here &apos;s mo@@ unt pin@@ at@@ u@@ b@@ o in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s . that put a whole bunch of sul@@ fu@@ r in the strat@@ o@@ sphere with a sort of atom@@ ic bom@@ b-@@ like cloud .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fing@@ ers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
and by doing that , it allows the virus to express ran@@ dom protein sequences .
one gra@@ m &apos;s 8@@ 0,000 individuals , 8@@ 0,000 individuals are good enough to control one ac@@ re , 4@@ ,000 square meters , of a stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry p@@ lot against spider mit@@ es for the whole season of almost one year .
so this gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te or ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te of data , we &apos;re putting it into this block .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensor@@ s that listen to these stor@@ ms , this electrical fir@@ ing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this stor@@ m to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extra@@ ct the motor messa@@ ges that are em@@ bed@@ ded in it , trans@@ late it into digital comm@@ ands and send it to an artificial device that will re@@ produce the volun@@ tary motor whe@@ el of that brain in real time .
these cur@@ ves for global temperature , atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic co2 and sea level were der@@ i@@ ved from ocean cor@@ es and antar@@ c@@ tic ice cor@@ es , from ocean se@@ di@@ ments and s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ kes that pil@@ ed up year after year over 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 years forming a two-@@ mile th@@ ick ice she@@ et .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all i &apos;ve got to do is know its frequ@@ ency . well , that &apos;s easy .
and they were looking at the net@@ fli@@ x qu@@ eu@@ es , and they notic@@ ed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have notic@@ ed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zi@@ p right up and out to our houses .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
i want my bro@@ ther &apos;s center of the universe and his symptom@@ s and his drugs , and all of the things that interact among those , the side effects , to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it , so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model i don &apos;t even know what a medical record is .
we &apos;ve scan@@ ned about 200@@ ,000 books .
so as i said , i think bread is a trans@@ forma@@ tional food .
what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musi@@ cal experience , not just listening , but making music ?
you ignore it . this is an impossible problem .
well , the heart be@@ ats , rhyth@@ mi@@ cally , ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly , fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully .
do you hi@@ re teachers ? do you build more schools ?
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
simil@@ arly comp@@ res@@ sed oxygen and other medical supp@@ lies are really a lu@@ x@@ ury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year .
so it should be possible to extra@@ ct valuable elements like li@@ th@@ ium for high-@@ performance batter@@ ies .
david si@@ b@@ bet from the gro@@ ve , and k@@ ev@@ in ri@@ char@@ ds , from auto@@ desk , made 6@@ 50 sk@@ et@@ ches that stri@@ ve to capture the essen@@ ce of each pres@@ enter &apos;s ideas .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stri@@ pped off of these tr@@ un@@ ks in the pac@@ i@@ fic nor@@ th@@ west ol@@ d-@@ growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell : you have brought us images from the yemen times .
i just was so -- how do i tell him ?
he said , &quot; that &apos;s all we can do , we &apos;ve got to stop the smo@@ ke . &quot;
so we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alex@@ and@@ ria .
politics has come to res@@ em@@ ble a cy@@ ni@@ cal team game played by politi@@ cians , while the public has been pus@@ hed asi@@ de as if sitting on the se@@ ats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradu@@ ally making room for blin@@ dness and des@@ per@@ ation .
but soon after , i developed a no@@ vel mathematical model that essentially quanti@@ fi@@ es the effect of these environmental pollu@@ tan@@ ts on the lung health of as@@ th@@ matic patients .
and everybody says it &apos;s because i have a little museum .
which is ever since , in the u.k. , they ban@@ ned smo@@ king in public places , i &apos;ve never enjo@@ yed a drin@@ ks party ever again .
the sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d had brea@@ ks . the neurons were cros@@ sing in every which way .
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organi@@ ze their society .
you can feel deep atta@@ ch@@ ment to a long-term partner while you feel inten@@ se roman@@ tic love for somebody else , while you feel the sex drive for people un@@ related to these other part@@ ners .
cy@@ n@@ thia schnei@@ der : the surprising spread of i@@ do@@ l tv
why are we em@@ bed@@ ded in social networks ?
and if some community me@@ mber is in this organi@@ zing position in every area after every dis@@ aster , these tools should exist .
again , i don &apos;t want to say that this kind of ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard pattern of interactions produ@@ ces a fac@@ tory that works with the prec@@ ision and efficiency of clo@@ ck@@ work .
in &quot; all sho@@ ok up , &quot; a touch is not a touch , but a ch@@ ill .
now the problem is , when you can &apos;t smo@@ ke , if you stand and st@@ are out of the window on your own , you &apos;re an anti@@ social , friend@@ less i@@ di@@ ot .
and part of the issue is for co@@ dy -- who &apos;s here , 16 years old -- and i have permission to rela@@ y this number .
my cu@@ ban mother , which i just brie@@ fly introdu@@ ced you to in that short character sk@@ et@@ ch , came to the united states one thousand years ago .
i &apos;m re@@ minded of what the architect mi@@ es van der ro@@ he said , and i par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase , when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth .
and because of that announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- wh@@ ere@@ as i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and raising a ro@@ und of v@@ enture capital and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
for those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , y@@ up , i know all about it .
there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of time for us to re@@ consider how we use it , how we build it .
so , while i can &apos;t auto@@ matically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citi@@ zen of any country , in dan@@ ger , i can say that britain is in a position where we &apos;re working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are vi@@ cti@@ ms of either genoci@@ de or human@@ it@@ arian attack , is something that is accep@@ ted by the whole world .
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this ma@@ dness .
i &apos;m going to go out on a limb here and say that if que@@ ens@@ land police didn &apos;t have o@@ .@@ c. spray , they wouldn &apos;t have shot 2,@@ 2@@ 26 people in those two years .
now , it &apos;s really convenient that spi@@ ders use their silk completely outside their body .
this tra@@ it also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .
it pac@@ ks a huge amount of data , and our brains are uni@@ qu@@ ely wired to de@@ code it .
and the idea was to create some self-@@ moving ben@@ ches in the main exhibi@@ tion room .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simpli@@ city gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
now in the middle of all this five senses work , i suddenly remembered the sol@@ ar-@@ powered clo@@ cks project from my you@@ th .
this is ma@@ hler .
and these have all co-@@ evolved .
it leaves their children paraly@@ zed , and it dra@@ gs their families deep@@ er into poverty , because they &apos;re des@@ per@@ ately se@@ arch@@ ing and they &apos;re des@@ per@@ ately spending the little bit of sa@@ v@@ ings that they have , trying in va@@ in to find a cure for their children .
this year &apos;s h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 threat was actually a human , a@@ vian , s@@ wine mix@@ ture that aro@@ se in mexico .
so we talked for a few minutes , and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you tell them what you believe ? &quot;
why would you buy an mp@@ 3 player from a computer company ?
so what next ?
if you ask this guy , what -- &quot; all that gli@@ t@@ ters is not gold , &quot; the patient says , &quot; well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ lic and sh@@ iny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
so i want to show you some cognitive illu@@ sions , or decisi@@ on-@@ making illu@@ sions , in the same way .
i got what you &apos;re thinking .
what they are is an addition of ta@@ d@@ po@@ les that are named after a local bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ at whose decisions affect your water quality .
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a wid@@ get like this . &quot;
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often di@@ stances us from them , and makes them little .
i don &apos;t think the leg@@ is@@ lation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pir@@ ated design and something that &apos;s just part of a global trend .
so it turns out there was a company across the river called google who had started a di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zation project a few years back that might just enable this approach .
they &apos;re really a sort of cosmic mus@@ h .
there may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our genom@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ dered a profound dis@@ ability .
they even have lan@@ ce arm@@ stron@@ g-@@ st@@ yle bra@@ cele@@ ts , these red bra@@ cele@@ ts , which signi@@ fy , in the small group , i am trying to main@@ tain my eating dis@@ order .
john mar@@ ko@@ ff : do you want to know what the counter@@ culture in drugs , sex , rock &apos; n &apos; roll and the anti-@@ war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
see , this one &apos;s coming back to its nest .
there &apos;s a million different ways to eat pizza .
so we &apos;ve talked a lot about fac@@ ial appe@@ ar@@ ance .
this is not a five-@@ minute pit@@ ch . this is , you know , two sent@@ ences .
and it turned out that jo@@ el and i were both bo@@ ther@@ ed by the same thing , which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn &apos;t , which , to both of us , seems somewhat inten@@ tionally off point .
dh : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , e@@ ma@@ ils , phone calls from people from all around the world .
the time &apos;s going back@@ wards because i &apos;m inside of it .
instead of making fo@@ ods that look like things that you wouldn &apos;t eat , we decided to make ingredients look like dis@@ hes that you know .
this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convin@@ cing re-@@ statement of chri@@ stian belief about god .
the motor of the brain . it &apos;s a drive .
then i got a s@@ co@@ op .
mar@@ cus : because i do what i like ?
it &apos;s like taking somebody out of a bur@@ ning building , treating them for smo@@ ke in@@ hal@@ ation and sen@@ ding them back into the building , because the oil is still g@@ us@@ hing .
so , soon after my arri@@ val , i had con@@ fir@@ med something which i had already known ; that my instru@@ ments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
you really have to be journ@@ ali@@ sts , you have to be invent@@ ors , you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything .
i know one guy who &apos;s spent $ 4@@ ,000 just on photo@@ shop over the years .
as i say , we go in and shake up other industri@@ es , and i think , you know , we do it differently and i think that industri@@ es are not quite the same as a result of virg@@ in attac@@ king the market .
and even if you &apos;ve had pizza with somebody for a very long time , don &apos;t you still say things like , &quot; should we get the usual ? &quot;
now we &apos;ve never seen a sha@@ do@@ w like this of a black hole , but black hol@@ es can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
the year is 1993 and he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all head@@ ing and how to popul@@ ari@@ ze all this .
turn them on their si@@ des , comb@@ ine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the bran@@ ches going up .
we put names on the board , atta@@ ch them to gu@@ esses , and kids have bought in here .
i started out in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay and went di@@ ving in the winter and became a tro@@ pic@@ al ec@@ ologist over@@ night .
well one day i was walking through union square , and i saw this building , which had just been built in 200@@ 5 .
you &apos;re gener@@ ali@@ zing . it &apos;s wrong .
they didn &apos;t ?
and he drives a very nice car .
he &apos;s swi@@ mm@@ ing down every a@@ venue until he finally gets to the plat@@ form .
so it &apos;s poin@@ ting away from the display , rather than poin@@ ting at the display .
it &apos;s got nutri@@ ents in it .
so the sign@@ al-@@ to-@@ noise ra@@ ti@@ o then pres@@ ents us with a patter@@ n-@@ dete@@ ction problem .
we &apos;ve got books , bu@@ ff@@ ets and radio waves , we@@ dding bri@@ des and roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster ri@@ des .
and so what i &apos;m going to show you is a three-@@ minute re@@ ader &apos;s di@@ gest version of the first aspe@@ ct of this film that we produced . it &apos;s an on@@ going project that &apos;s going to go another four or five years .
but when climate became , poli@@ tically , a hot top@@ ic -- if i may make the pu@@ n -- in the last 15 years , this became so un@@ -@@ pc , we couldn &apos;t talk about it .
so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this : it sa@@ ved me from having a single story of what books are .
it quickly es@@ cal@@ ates .
our parents are il@@ liter@@ ate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
and we found that if your friend becomes ob@@ ese , it incre@@ ases your risk of o@@ bes@@ ity by about 5@@ 7 percent in the same given time period .
thank you .
i offici@@ ally took a break from singing , and i went to the cle@@ vel@@ and clin@@ ic to be re@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ated for the third time in five years , for transplant .
culture &apos;s a very important tool to bring people together .
and then when they ans@@ wer@@ ed , i would inf@@ late that number of ballo@@ ons and give them that number of ballo@@ ons to hold .
j@@ n : yeah .
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny , the penny marsh@@ all to the marsh@@ all plan to &quot; plan 9 &quot; to nine lives : it &apos;s all the same .
you know , we have to change it .
perfect .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomen@@ on ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
and you know why they have a design ?
and then god looked to the future and realized that , in fact , if the world were just fil@@ led with compassion , there would be an@@ arch@@ y and chaos .
expres@@ sive spac@@ es may distur@@ b us .
we fil@@ ter through some simple appar@@ at@@ uses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day fil@@ ter@@ ing on top of a building in new york city .
just consider this : five million ni@@ ghts have been boo@@ ked on air@@ b@@ n@@ b in the past six months alone .
the famous su@@ f@@ i ma@@ ster rum@@ i , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he kno@@ cks on the door , and a voice answers , &quot; who &apos;s there ? &quot;
he said , &quot; god wants bread . that &apos;s it . god wants bread . i know what god wants . &quot;
everyone bur@@ st into lau@@ ghter . i was hu@@ mili@@ ated .
&quot; don &apos;t give us any of that self-@@ actu@@ alization stuff .
it &apos;s a big issue .
so as we are facing all the multiple cris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titude , effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
and that too is a relatively new idea .
why doesn &apos;t it sm@@ ell of po@@ tat@@ oes or vio@@ lets ? well , there are really two theor@@ ies .
and now , 14 of the dis@@ or@@ ders are treat@@ able , two of them actually cur@@ able .
and i realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot;
but recently , we &apos;ve been wonder@@ ing whether it might be possible to take advan@@ tage of this in@@ sight , to actually find ways to improve the world , to do something better , to actually fix things , not just understand things .
this is not the place for hate and anger .
with this in mind , we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space .
and a little bit higher , why they have a gla@@ ze on a thing they call a thal@@ i .
he says , &quot; fat@@ ality investig@@ ations for fire@@ figh@@ ters often inclu@@ de &apos; we didn &apos;t think the fire was going to do that , &apos; even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions . &quot;
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in war@@ e@@ houses .
and if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those pil@@ es of bur@@ ning , sm@@ ol@@ dering coal waste look like .
they gave them their name .
photograph@@ er paul ni@@ ck@@ lin traveled to antar@@ c@@ tica to shoot a story on le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a milli@@ meter .
and the reason why they have to go under@@ ground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth , the same experiment would be s@@ w@@ am@@ ped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays , ambi@@ ent radio activity , even our own bodies . you might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radio@@ active enough to distur@@ b this experiment .
and if you look in a compar@@ ison , on the left , we see what volu@@ metri@@ c data gives us and on the right you see what mark@@ ers give us .
if you take the difference between these two images here , you can get an image li@@ t from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of emi@@ ly &apos;s skin .
public space .
and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the po@@ or@@ er people in the lower cities , about 10 to 12 percent of the people have moved to the upper city .
it &apos;s called &quot; drop dead healthy . &quot;
they &apos;re the ones you find on the kitchen counter@@ top .
and it &apos;s because i &apos;m giving you critical data about me .
now , i &apos;m going to give you some demon@@ stra@@ tions up here , live , right now .
nei@@ ther of those appro@@ a@@ ches is sensi@@ ble .
and yet , it never happens .
so , would little lewis have an ast@@ ro@@ lab@@ e ?
are nike t-@@ shir@@ ts that are almost identical to one another .
we &apos;ve also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule , that all of the dna in your body has been around forever , since the beginning of us , of us as creatures .
this is the thermodynam@@ ic cycle that produ@@ ces electricity , and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient , between 45 and 50 percent efficiency .
live long and pro@@ sp@@ er .
we &apos;re going to have -- -- we &apos;re going to have to live closer to where we work .
thank you .
so , as sort of — i &apos;m told it &apos;s called a stadium wave , so we &apos;re going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
so all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses .
in fact , i &apos;m leaving .
two quot@@ ations to more or less end with .
and so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn &apos;t do a che@@ es@@ y adver@@ t for britain .
and pau@@ la rad@@ cli@@ ffe at that point says , &quot; i &apos;m done . go . &quot;
and the nature of a given cell driving its underlying bio@@ chemistry is di@@ ct@@ ated by which of these 25@@ ,000 genes are turned on and at what level they &apos;re turned on .
not you . not i .
but what they did was keep us in play .
and we were testing if the mi@@ ce would also self-@@ ad@@ minister ss@@ ris .
it was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of dna , in@@ je@@ cted it in the bacteria and all of a sudden , that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria .
we also de@@ plo@@ yed a couple of satellite ta@@ gs , so we did use hi@@ -@@ tech stuff as well .
that some@@ day is already here if you &apos;re a mouse .
i have to say , her hus@@ band bac@@ ked her from the start .
you &apos;ve figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbit@@ ing the planet from a known location on the ground .
thank you .
if i make the fla@@ p as sk@@ inn@@ y as possible , i get to the limit of the min@@ imum amount of paper needed .
is it nuclear capacity ? we know we have that .
that was designed on that machine , in the wo@@ ods behind the institute .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorith@@ mic order in a colum@@ n .
but their body language is great .
first of all , we have all the stati@@ st@@ ical analy@@ ses from the inno@@ cence project work , where we know that we have , what , 250 , 2@@ 80 docum@@ ented cases now where people have been wr@@ ong@@ fully convi@@ cted and sub@@ sequ@@ ently ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated , some from death row , on the basis of later dna analysis , and you know that over three quar@@ ters of all of those cases of ex@@ on@@ er@@ ation involved only e@@ ye@@ witness identifi@@ cation te@@ stim@@ ony during the trial that convi@@ cted them .
did you feel a sense of moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity ?
i was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
what happened ?
in man@@ a@@ geri@@ al accoun@@ ting , i &apos;m ch@@ ap@@ ter eight .
so , i started to write computer programs that study very , very large sets of these online foot@@ prin@@ ts .
and if you think about the computer industry and how we &apos;ve gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time , the same thing is happening with gene sequen@@ cing now : we are on the c@@ us@@ p of being able to sequence human genom@@ es for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-@@ hour ; you will see that happen in the next five years .
and the water at the north pole is min@@ us 1.@@ 7 .
we call these wor@@ d@@ scap@@ es .
you can do bigger things .
form is function . form is function .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
for five years , young em@@ manu@@ el j@@ al f@@ ought as a child soldi@@ er in the sud@@ an . res@@ cu@@ ed by an aid wor@@ ker , he &apos;s become an international hi@@ p-@@ ho@@ p star and an activ@@ ist for kids in war zones . in words and lyri@@ cs , he tells the story of his amazing life .
k &apos;@@ na@@ an : oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-@@ oh give you freedom , give you fire give you reason , take you higher see the cham@@ pi@@ ons take the field now you define us , make us feel proud in the streets our heads are li@@ fted as we lose our in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion celebra@@ tion , it &apos;s around us every nation , all around us mel@@ in@@ da french gates : it feels pretty good , right ?
and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities , the greatest spac@@ es that we have had .
an opening cer@@ em@@ ony to match every other .
i don &apos;t know why national geographic has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re allo@@ wing me to show you a few images from a co@@ verage that i &apos;ve just comple@@ ted that is not published yet .
well , solar power air@@ planes are not new .
in fact , we &apos;re probably forming these micro@@ scop@@ ic can@@ cers all the time in our body .
but what ama@@ zes me is simon &apos;s incredible geographic imagination .
i &apos;m much more trying to add to some of the questions we &apos;re talking about .
my question is : how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
we are feeding our kids antibio@@ tics in bee@@ f and other animal protein every day .
so this is a little wi@@ re-@@ ben@@ ding tool .
both are of the male sex .
they cho@@ se instead tur@@ key and mexico to set up the tex@@ ti@@ les fac@@ tor@@ ies , because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent .
it &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it anymore . it &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
so let me di@@ ver@@ t for a second as we &apos;re going to identify the problems , the challenges , the behavi@@ oral challenges , that prevent people from saving .
and then there &apos;s this one : &quot; if there &apos;s gr@@ ass on the field , play ball . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be very challenging to deal with .
but it is within our self-@@ interest to understand the topo@@ graphy of our lives un@@ to ourselves .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
who li@@ kes that answer ?
as of today , i@@ de india , am@@ it@@ ab@@ ha &apos;s organization , has sold over 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 farmers these systems and has seen their y@@ i@@ el@@ ds and in@@ comes double or tri@@ ple on average , but this didn &apos;t happen over@@ night .
ryan merk@@ ley : online video -- an@@ not@@ ated , re@@ mix@@ ed and po@@ pped
here &apos;s another example of how compar@@ ing to the past can be@@ fu@@ ddle our decisions .
i was also influ@@ enced by another experience that i had , again , when i was in texas , before i moved to stanford .
shor@@ tly after i per@@ formed the first li@@ ver transplant , i recei@@ ved my next as@@ sign@@ ment , and that was to go to the pris@@ ons to harv@@ est organs from execu@@ ted pris@@ on@@ ers .
guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequen@@ cing .
so i come up , and i say , &quot; what am i going to do today ? &quot; i &apos;m not going to do what i plan@@ ned to do , and i put myself into absolute pan@@ ic .
history , like god , is watching what we do .
how did i not know ?
can we use the physical simulation of the character , use artificial intelligence , put that artificial intelligence into the character , drive virtual mus@@ cles , simu@@ late the way he jump@@ s off the da@@ m , and then sky@@ di@@ ve afterwards , and have him cau@@ ght by a bun@@ ge@@ e afterwards ?
it also makes sense in very strong markets .
my mother wanted me to be a den@@ ti@@ st .
and it takes place in an area called the she@@ ph@@ el@@ ah in what is now isra@@ el .
these days , bits are cheap . unfortunately , that means you &apos;ve got to spend more time sor@@ ting through them .
have a look at this bit of film foot@@ age .
now the u@@ ph@@ ill battle for ghana and for africa is not over , but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists , and that we must not take it for granted .
this is not only a change in water and where the shor@@ eline is , this is a change in the fundament@@ als of the environment of this region .
they have a lot of bio@@ diversity , a lot of carbon , things we want to protect .
but now , we &apos;re hit@@ ting , as i &apos;ve just described , we &apos;re hit@@ ting the third replic@@ ator point .
that &apos;s an entire second ad@@ ult life@@ time that &apos;s been ad@@ ded to our li@@ fes@@ pan .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mi@@ mic its environment and disappe@@ ar .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
i think we can one-@@ up the gre@@ e@@ ks and achieve something .
also around this time , at home , this was the computer that people were buying .
so , you click down on the als ta@@ b there .
now , what does syl@@ vi@@ a brow@@ ne give you for that 7@@ 00 dollars ?
and that kept him going .
do you understand ?
&quot; orig@@ ins &quot; is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fet@@ al orig@@ ins .
that termin@@ ology has stuck , but it doesn &apos;t actually re@@ fer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms .
so , eric jo@@ h@@ ans@@ on , who built the device , actually , with parts from e@@ bay ; and p@@ ab@@ los hol@@ man over here , he &apos;s got mosquit@@ oes in the t@@ ank .
but wilkins , you know , thought dna was the best bet , and he showed this x-ray photograph .
did you see it go ?
they &apos;re now saying that in america , that middle age should be re@@ gar@@ ded as up to age 85 .
but if we believe we &apos;re better than the other guy , well that means that we &apos;re more likely to get that pro@@ motion , to re@@ main mar@@ ried , because we &apos;re more social , more interesting .
and two years later , the same a@@ ward came to est@@ on@@ ia .
a guy named je@@ ff br@@ in@@ ker has found a way to have a self-@@ assem@@ bl@@ ing co@@ ding process .
like that . and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
i travel all over the world taking pictures -- some of them good , most of them not .
you know in 19@@ 50 the typical ship car@@ ried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goo@@ ds .
they &apos;re an integra@@ l part of the pen@@ i@@ le skelet@@ on .
he car@@ ed in a very different man@@ ner , but it takes a lot of time to understand that .
now , in america , in fact , you cannot give up your right to trial by jury .
and they take the dirty she@@ ets down to the la@@ undry .
he said , &quot; because i heard you built the center and i didn &apos;t believe that you did it , and i wanted to see for myself .
but it would be an or@@ gas@@ m -- nonetheless .
by the way , this video is pretty accurate of how the land@@ ing took place , you know , about four years ago .
and of el pe@@ je .
so that , this belief in each other , knowing that without a dou@@ bt and practic@@ ing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what i believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
so they ad@@ ded two addi@@ tional compon@@ ents .
this little re@@ lief on the foot@@ pla@@ te , by the way , to a ri@@ der means there &apos;s something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
as you heard in the film , anywhere else , not here .
and i think part of what i &apos;m learning in this process is that one must allow on@@ es@@ el@@ f to feel g@@ rief .
but actually ro@@ tat@@ ing from stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed right to stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed left , main@@ ta@@ ining that fu@@ sel@@ age position as long as possible .
it was an@@ arch@@ y .
and if your brain is fail@@ ing at inte@@ gr@@ ating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your ro@@ se@@ -@@ tin@@ ted spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ les on .
the paper apo@@ logi@@ zed but said it never r@@ uns photos of women .
there &apos;s no more of it .
now let me be clear . i &apos;m not bl@@ am@@ ing the women here .
could we put it back in the thr@@ one of the king of be@@ a@@ sts in tasman@@ ia where it bel@@ on@@ gs , restore that ecosystem ?
li@@ ke@@ wise , for the young stars , or in contr@@ ast , the young stars , they just should not be there .
temple grand@@ in : because who do you think made the first stone spe@@ ars ?
he said , &quot; you have taught me to walk .
and as soon as the cr@@ ab@@ s tou@@ ched the arm , it was lights out .
method acting is nothing but a mix@@ ture of multiple person@@ alities , believ@@ ing your own lies are reality , like in high school cool kenn@@ y telling me he wanted to be a co@@ p .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
and it becomes critical for the ir@@ ani@@ ans to remember their great past , their great past when they f@@ ought iraq and won .
and these ti@@ ling units , i designed specifically so that they would con@@ tain parts of let@@ ter@@ forms within their shapes so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstra@@ ct patter@@ ning .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &apos;s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earli@@ est phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
she made a decision not to go and get a ra@@ z@@ or or a glass sh@@ ard , but to de@@ vote her life to stop@@ ping that happening to other girls .
right ? we &apos;ve created a professional class of photogra@@ pher@@ s whose goal is to go out and photograph the mer@@ ma@@ id par@@ ade , or whatever else they &apos;re sent out to photograph .
she &apos;s 2@@ 3 . she &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
now , i &apos;ll show you some of the for@@ ums , most of which were self-@@ organi@@ zed by the students themselves .
so how do we pro@@ ce@@ ed in our qu@@ est for happiness ? very often , we look outside .
it &apos;s simple , you tell them they &apos;re from mcdonald &apos;s .
all of these would have been great things to do , and my nur@@ ses had no idea .
and this boo@@ king is within all the par@@ am@@ e@@ ters for each individual .
and then our mothers tell us , &quot; care@@ ful you don &apos;t fall down &quot; -- because you &apos;ll fall over .
fungi multi@@ pli@@ ed . or@@ chi@@ ds emer@@ ged , gen@@ itali@@ a shaped to l@@ ure insects ...
&quot; connected &quot; is a collabor@@ ation with ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ er gi@@ de@@ on ob@@ arz@@ an@@ ek .
giving up the fight -- for that &apos;s how it felt , it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story , our story of us as figh@@ ters , the story of us as inv@@ inci@@ ble , and for the doctors , the story of themselves as heal@@ ers .
in other words , i can trust him or her .
and what i found is that most companies and schools follow a formul@@ a for success , which is this : if i work harder , i &apos;ll be more successful .
that &apos;s so much energy , you couldn &apos;t afford to des@@ al@@ in@@ ate or clean water in this country that way .
so in my work , i hear that life is hard , relationships are fil@@ led with risk .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
so if our problem was to get the human economy down from 150 percent to 100 percent of the earth &apos;s capacity , we could do that .
so being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embra@@ ce .
i mean , if you can talk it , a mo@@ ck@@ ing@@ bird can squ@@ aw@@ k it .
let &apos;s get these brain stab@@ bers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain .
and i wasn &apos;t the only one .
we have made these kinds of devices using nap@@ kins and toi@@ let paper and wra@@ ps , and all kinds of stuff .
you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your an@@ alog life .
but my personal favorite of these ones , i have to con@@ f@@ ess , does actually come from the united states : &quot; offic@@ ers tas@@ er 8@@ 6 year-old dis@@ ab@@ led woman in her bed . &quot;
charles ander@@ son : dra@@ gon@@ flies that fly across oceans
so this is very surprising .
for me , at ni@@ h now for almost 20 years , there has never been a time where there was more exc@@ it@@ ement about the potential that lies in front of us .
they &apos;ve fund@@ ed research that shows that we can double global pal@@ m oil production without cu@@ tting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in bor@@ ne@@ o alone by plan@@ ting on land that &apos;s already de@@ gra@@ ded .
and i &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
any one of you who has taken someone else &apos;s job , or tried to give yours to someone else , no matter how deta@@ iled the manu@@ al , you cannot trans@@ mit what you know , what you will intu@@ it under a certain set of cir@@ cum@@ stances .
so we have to use this one car@@ efully .
afterwards , i played a pi@@ an@@ o tra@@ ck underneath so that the sing@@ ers would have something to listen to .
with this whole sort of su@@ ite of policies , we could actually reduce our gas@@ ol@@ ine consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020 .
just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy .
there are an aw@@ ful lot of things that you &apos;d like to distingu@@ ish among .
well , the second part of that , soon after -- and i was talking to paul allen ; i saw him in the audience , and i hand@@ ed him a copy of &quot; rare earth . &quot;
here &apos;s what it looks like in 2000 .
within the next few years , many of you will be the proud ow@@ ner of a gps dot .
it &apos;s no different than che@@ cking an email .
it is peac@@ eful and violent .
and men are affected by those rules too .
speaking at li@@ ft 2007 , sug@@ ata mit@@ ra talks about his hole in the wall project . young kids in this project figured out how to use a pc on their own -- and then taught other kids . he as@@ ks , what else can children teach themselves ?
you can see it &apos;s pretty much covered .
fast forward three years . i did eventually get off the so@@ f@@ a , and start plan@@ ning another expedi@@ tion . this time , i wanted to go right across , on my own this time , from rus@@ si@@ a , at the top of the map , to the north pole , where the sort of kin@@ k in the middle is , and then on to canada .
how much more she reve@@ als in her gl@@ are of ink than she knows .
did i say that ? i guess i did .
but it turned out there was a technical twi@@ st to c@@ aro@@ l &apos;s case .
so the idea is to create an object able to force the air , and to be in cont@@ act at the right speed at the right place , in all the effective parts of the plant .
but in this bar@@ rage of noise that i &apos;m putting out , i actually live an incredibly an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous and private life .
now with the allo@@ cation and the understanding of the lack of understanding , we enter into a new er@@ a of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves , com@@ por@@ ary or non-@@ com@@ por@@ ary , will figu@@ ra@@ tively figure into the folding of our non-@@ understanding and our par@@ tial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclu@@ sions from .
so here &apos;s our little solar system , as we pull away from our mel@@ ted planet here .
i think we &apos;re going to end up , in the next few years , to understand all kinds of brain mechan@@ is@@ ms that pull us to one person rather than another .
they have evolved over millen@@ nia .
thank you .
i teach writing work@@ shops in la@@ gos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are e@@ ager to write , to tell stories .
the fif@@ th thing is that maybe , after 2,@@ 500 years , pla@@ to is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms .
we got the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be so we can actually hear the world .
but that sugge@@ sts the issue that i &apos;m trying to get at here , that we have an opportunity to re@@ define what is health .
one of the most important things in my 200@@ -@@ year plan that ne@@ tra and i write is what to forget about ourselves .
less than 10 % of plastic tr@@ ash is recy@@ cl@@ ed -- compar@@ ed to almost 90 % of met@@ als -- because of the mas@@ si@@ vely complicated problem of finding and sor@@ ting the different kinds . frustrated by this waste , mike bi@@ ddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can , and does , re@@ cycle any kind of plastic . &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; h@@ ttp : / / blog@@ .@@ ted@@ .com / 2012 / 10 / 2@@ 2 / a-@@ bet@@ ter@@ -@@ wa@@ y-@@ to-@@ recy@@ cle@@ -@@ pla@@ st@@ ic@@ s-@@ mi@@ ke@@ -@@ bi@@ dd@@ le-@@ repli@@ es@@ -@@ to-@@ questi@@ on@@ s-@@ and-@@ comm@@ ent@@ s-@@ ab@@ out@@ -@@ h@@ is@@ -@@ 20@@ 1@@ 1@@ -@@ tedtalk &quot; &amp; gt ; read mike &apos;s respon@@ ses to questions about this talk . &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ;
this is in nature : it over@@ ri@@ des a car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous nature and what other@@ wise would have been a short fight to the death .
have you ever experienced a moment in your life that was so pain@@ ful and con@@ f@@ using that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all ?
i &apos;m wearing a camera , just a simple web@@ c@@ am , a port@@ able , batter@@ y-@@ powered proje@@ ction system with a little mirror .
i move from this , from fre@@ ak@@ ed out to en@@ ra@@ ged .
and it seem@@ ed to me that there were three levels of accep@@ t@@ ance that needed to take place .
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
for the big companies , it &apos;s re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tional risk , but more importantly , they don &apos;t care what the price of com@@ modi@@ ties is .
but who is going to pay for all this ?
that &apos;s very fascinating .
oh , and that &apos;s not even the ti@@ p of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
on the day you are in a place where there is no co@@ verage , the f@@ bi gets crazy ?
thank you very much .
and we don &apos;t appear until about 99@@ .@@ 9@@ 6 percent of the time into this story , just to put ourselves and our ance@@ stors in perspective .
and the city has plan@@ ned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ feet of development that the high line is going to ring around .
two new kinds of whales have been discovered , along with two new an@@ tel@@ op@@ es , do@@ zens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a dist@@ in@@ ct kind of gor@@ ill@@ a .
and this is the world that we lived in .
i &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i &apos;m going to be showing you exist .
the em@@ pi@@ re of iran , the me@@ des and the per@@ si@@ ans , united under cy@@ rus , became the first great world em@@ pi@@ re .
it &apos;s a value of the limits in regu@@ lation .
if somebody from 197@@ 3 looked at what was on a dor@@ mit@@ ory message board in 1993 , the s@@ lang would have changed a little bit since the er@@ a of &quot; love story , &quot; but they would understand what was on that message board .
ok ? i just , this is why i love what michael does , because it &apos;s like , ok , if he &apos;s de@@ bun@@ king it , then i don &apos;t have to .
so here &apos;s just a quick video of what this looks like .
what goes in is what we are .
this story im@@ parts information that the fe@@ tu@@ s uses to organi@@ ze its body and its systems -- an adap@@ tation to pre@@ vail@@ ing cir@@ cum@@ stances that facili@@ tat@@ es its future survival .
it &apos;s an inten@@ sely , inten@@ sely physical process .
the lo@@ ving sou@@ l of the universe .
we went down into the ri@@ ft valley .
sure , you got some pleas@@ ure out of it , maybe your ego stro@@ ked , maybe you get some professional status in the field .
te@@ hr@@ an was not interested .
of course , in muslim , because of the teach@@ ings around the concept of i@@ dol@@ at@@ ry , you don &apos;t find as many physical represent@@ ations of di@@ vin@@ ity or of spiritual liber@@ ation as you do in the buddh@@ ist tradition , where , of course , there are many stat@@ ues of the buddha that are highly re@@ vered .
we thought that maybe ni@@ tri@@ c oxide affected cell death , and how cells survive , and their resi@@ stance to other things .
we have to develop the gl@@ uten .
li@@ ght@@ ning li@@ t the sky , and a baby was born .
bru@@ ce wa@@ y@@ ne is in his bed@@ room when a big bat flies over his head , and he sees it as an omen to become bat@@ man .
but as the article men@@ tions , because of enzy@@ me break@@ down , it &apos;s unlikely that phen@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ine will reach your brain if taken or@@ ally .
but , we don &apos;t have time .
&quot; what does it matter ? &quot; they said , &quot; a bul@@ let doesn &apos;t distingu@@ ish between a muslim and a chri@@ stian . &quot;
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph -- it begins in 197@@ 3 , just before women start f@@ loo@@ ding the work@@ force , and it brings us up to our current day .
the en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment , a revolution in how people sou@@ ght knowledge , trying not to rely on auth@@ ority .
my whole life is now going to focus away from evil -- that i &apos;ve been in since i was a kid -- to understanding heroes .
on the hu@@ d@@ son river ?
e-@@ commer@@ ce has been growing exponenti@@ ally . it &apos;s now a trillion dollars .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
we &apos;re looking for this behavior among white vot@@ ers or , really , non-@@ black vot@@ ers .
but in ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s case , that was the beginning of the story .
and so i just want to do a quick demo .
freedom means i may not be identifi@@ ed as any one group , but that i can visit and find myself in every group .
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about mol@@ as and sun@@ fish .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a sk@@ inn@@ y lat@@ te from the caf@@ e next door .
but we think about games as fun , and that &apos;s completely reas@@ on@@ able , but let &apos;s just think about this .
this is very graphi@@ cally shown by the world@@ ma@@ pp@@ er website and project .
it &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loo@@ p : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indi@@ cate .
the good news is you don &apos;t need to be brilliant to be wise .
everyone has done something .
so on this tour , i hope i provi@@ ded you with a new perspective of the high se@@ as : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all .
but ever since then , the wheelchair has been a given in my life .
thank you .
now you may pre@@ fer this lo@@ a@@ f of bread .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and i &apos;m not really foc@@ using on the nega@@ tives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of ran@@ dom , young black mal@@ es growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during crack were about one percent .
over the next few years , astron@@ om@@ ers connected up their anten@@ n@@ as to lou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers and learned about our radio sky , about jupiter and the sun , by listening .
where did this guy get this confidence , the au@@ d@@ ac@@ ity of it ?
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teen@@ age girls called ro@@ ok@@ ie@@ mag@@ .com .
people are now confi@@ dent to bring -- if your people in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
we &apos;ll walk you , you lead us . &quot;
we know these cor@@ als grow about a c@@ enti@@ meter and a half a year .
but beyond exhi@@ bit@@ ing contemporary art , the hir@@ sh@@ hor@@ n will become a public forum , a place of dis@@ course for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
they didn &apos;t get di@@ ab@@ etes ; they didn &apos;t get heart disease ; they lived 20 percent longer ; they got the health benef@@ its of cal@@ or@@ ic re@@ stri@@ ction without the re@@ stri@@ ction .
it &apos;s got a ch@@ in bar@@ bel .
my mother said that she thought i &apos;d really rather have a blue balloon .
so it &apos;s actually life , but it &apos;s actually not as we thought life would be .
the first one is a poly@@ ani@@ on@@ ic seg@@ ment , which basically acts as a non-@@ stick bac@@ king like the back of a sti@@ cker .
hope is personal . hope is something that no one can give to you .
and it la@@ y precisely in that in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able curi@@ osity , that ir@@ repres@@ si@@ ble desire to know , no matter what the subject , no matter what the cost , even at a time when the ke@@ e@@ pers of the do@@ om@@ s@@ day clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won &apos;t be around to imagine anything in the year 2@@ 100 , a sc@@ ant 9@@ 3 years from now .
the phili@@ pp@@ ines of today has almost the same economy as the united states during the first world war .
space is just one aspe@@ ct , so there &apos;s no meaning to say absolutely where something is .
just looked like the coast of california for me .
now what we have to imagine is the mental arti@@ ll@@ ery that we have picked up over those hundred years , and i think again that another thin@@ ker will help us here , and that &apos;s lu@@ ria .
p@@ g : she hit good .
and he started y@@ elling at me , and i said to the transl@@ ator , &quot; ok , tell him to cal@@ m down , what is he saying ? &quot;
no , no . the other way .
if you do come to cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , you will probably see an inst@@ al@@ lation by ai wei@@ we@@ i , the chinese artist .
if your economy gro@@ ws with four percent , you ought to reduce child mortality four percent ; if it &apos;s used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it .
anyway , chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
so it would be a good thing .
how many would rule in fa@@ vor of cas@@ ey martin ?
the first is this : that china is not really a nation@@ -@@ state .
if you &apos;re trying to influ@@ ence corpo@@ ra@@ tions to change their behavior , with reg@@ ard to producing pollu@@ tan@@ ts , one approach , the common approach , is to ex@@ h@@ ort them to be better , to explain to them what damage they &apos;re doing to the planet .
what &apos;s its future ?
so i started to consider what i should do , and i thought , i wanted to make my performance better , and to show on@@ stage how spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ular the yo@@ -@@ yo could be to change the public &apos;s image of the yo@@ -@@ yo .
it will be something that we talk about in 100 years .
but it was worth it , because we cau@@ ght it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it &apos;s not that simple , because we are not simple .
and &quot; done this before &quot; is starting an enter@@ prise and creating value , and taking something from beginning to end .
and i show things for really what they are , what they &apos;re made of .
&quot; i feel s@@ as@@ sy . &quot;
of course , what happens when they eat the po@@ ta@@ to chi@@ ps ?
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the regi@@ ster@@ ed things in the e.@@ u .
but certainly in people older than my wife , this appears to be a more mar@@ ked effect .
would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow ?
now four com isa@@ f &apos;s later , we hear a different message : &quot; this cannot be won milit@@ arily .
a little bit faster .
and these are two of the pen@@ gu@@ ins &apos; main bre@@ eding is@@ lands .
often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life .
you &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is hand@@ ing back qui@@ z pa@@ pers , and one of them looks like this .
i didn &apos;t have one of those , but i got the fit@@ bit .
and to be fair , i was des@@ per@@ ate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange comm@@ ent@@ ator .
but you know what ?
in this case a rather strange and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able activity happened over the last bre@@ eding season , wher@@ ein a large male king co@@ bra actually grab@@ bed a female king co@@ bra , didn &apos;t mate with it , actually killed it and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed it .
we &apos;re going to move the car according to that over and over again .
and it &apos;s how we can b@@ end the ar@@ c of history down towards zero , just doing the things that we know work .
these sau@@ sa@@ ge-@@ shaped things are the chromosom@@ es , and we &apos;ll focus on them .
it &apos;s com@@ mon@@ ly repor@@ ted in u@@ kra@@ ine that children , when leaving the or@@ phan@@ age are tar@@ ge@@ ted for human traff@@ i@@ cking , child por@@ no@@ graphy and prostit@@ ution .
the way i want to do this is to build a facili@@ ty where i can study this .
for example , when americans are asked to esti@@ mate the od@@ ds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are esti@@ mates of number of deaths per year per 200 million u.s. citizens .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can pres@@ erve dar@@ k@@ ness .
this is from &quot; the unti@@ ed states of america . &quot;
well , that la@@ sted 17 years .
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
this is called &quot; gravity . &quot;
and we go to live con@@ cer@@ ts , and we get that as much as we can .
and though she had been part of building a liber@@ al party , a political party that was focused on diversity and toler@@ ance , about three months before the genoci@@ de , she swit@@ ched par@@ ties and jo@@ ined the extrem@@ ist party , hu@@ tu power , and she became the minister of justi@@ ce under the genoci@@ de regime and was known for inc@@ iting men to kill faster and stop beha@@ ving like women .
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
we have a little tiny community called green@@ ville , mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an , population 8@@ ,000 , and they are about to lose their major emplo@@ yer , which is a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator fac@@ tory that &apos;s oper@@ ated by electro@@ lu@@ x . &quot;
and that in a sense re@@ moves us again , like all of our scientific disco@@ ver@@ ies , or many of them -- it &apos;s this continu@@ ous de@@ thr@@ on@@ ing of man -- of how we think we &apos;re special because we &apos;re alive .
and i &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my pe@@ ers .
and so we started thinking .
he was from north texas .
this is one that i loved .
this is all seven har@@ ry po@@ tter no@@ vels , because she did tend to f@@ af@@ f on a bit near the end .
and this is like robo@@ tics without wir@@ es or mot@@ ors .
this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we &apos;ve connected in this way .
but i don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate , even if i can &apos;t tell the difference .
this is commer@@ ce in ken@@ ya , right along the train tra@@ cks , so close to the train tra@@ cks that the mer@@ chan@@ ts sometimes have to pull the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise out of the way .
so that was at eight o &apos;@@ clock at night .
and i had no idea that i was one of those ob@@ no@@ xi@@ ous people you occasi@@ on@@ ally see wea@@ ving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smo@@ oth .
but these things evolved over many years , and now what we &apos;re trying to do -- i get three weeks to design a telephone .
that formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same as it is right now .
&quot; spu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; will soon be rele@@ as@@ ed .
but instead i saw this .
and this is not an isol@@ ated story .
if i give you the le@@ tter q and ask you to predict the next le@@ tter , what do you think that would be ?
because every generation thin@@ ks we are the final one .
but one of the cool@@ est things in this book are the interactive inf@@ ographi@@ cs .
now most pol@@ lin@@ ators that we think about are insects , but actually in the tro@@ pic@@ s , many birds and bu@@ tter@@ flies pol@@ lin@@ ate .
in fact , you might have even seen some ca@@ vit@@ ation going up the edge of the limb .
and this is a particularly small s@@ co@@ ot@@ er for a gentle@@ man of this size .
all of these things are coming together , and it &apos;s a particularly important thing to understand , as we worry about the fl@@ ames of the present , to keep an eye on the future .
somehow he did .
the gu@@ ar is an en@@ danger@@ ed sou@@ the@@ ast asi@@ an un@@ gu@@ late .
he says this : &quot; had i the hea@@ v@@ ens &apos; em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered clo@@ ths , en@@ wr@@ ought with gold and sil@@ ver light , the blue and the di@@ m and the dark clo@@ ths of night and light and the half-@@ light , i would spread the clo@@ ths under your feet : but i , being poor , have only my dreams ; i have spread my dreams under your feet ; tre@@ ad soft@@ ly because you tre@@ ad on my dreams . &quot;
and there you can see what a li@@ ver@@ pool sea looks like on a typical after@@ no@@ on .
and we &apos;re also their closest cou@@ sin .
as i became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life , i was probably 30 pounds less than i am right now .
this is ni@@ les el@@ dre@@ dge . he was the co-@@ develop@@ er with stephen ja@@ y g@@ ould of the theory of pun@@ ctu@@ ated equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
memory system , right ?
a so@@ matic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gest@@ ated in the o@@ v@@ um of a co@@ w , and then that co@@ w gave birth to a gu@@ ar .
now having evolved language , though , we did something pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , even bi@@ zar@@ re .
it could be , you know , for some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting . it might be giving a pit@@ ch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
this kind of market risk is mind-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , and has direct impli@@ cations for not only the inc@@ enti@@ ves of farmers to inv@@ est in higher produ@@ ctivity technology , such as modern seeds and ferti@@ li@@ zers , but also direct impli@@ cations for food security .
and they don &apos;t want to let me in .
these things would drop down from above all through the wee@@ k@@ end of rocket laun@@ ch after rocket laun@@ ch after rocket laun@@ ch .
and about five or six hours later , she said we could go home .
and then you have yemen .
i mean , this was great .
throughout human evolution , multiple versi@@ ons of humans co-@@ exi@@ sted . could we be mi@@ d-@@ up@@ grade now ? at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z swe@@ ep@@ s across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is reve@@ aling evidence that sugge@@ sts rapid evolution may be under way .
but it turns out that this phenomen@@ on of publi@@ cation bias has actually been very , very well studied .
those shapes are difficult to change .
i was part of this sort of background noise of the miser@@ y of za@@ ire , completely invisible .
radi@@ ologists classi@@ fy breast den@@ sity into four categ@@ ories based on the appe@@ ar@@ ance of the tissue on a mammo@@ gra@@ m .
so , i &apos;m not going to talk about that .
occasi@@ on@@ ally , there were pri@@ zes , such as that given to john har@@ ris@@ on in the 18@@ th century , for solving the so@@ -@@ called lon@@ g@@ itu@@ de problem , but pri@@ zes were only given after the fact , when they were given at all .
so we decided to do a massive set of calcu@@ lations and started producing green accoun@@ ts for india and its states .
so there &apos;s lessons to learn , and there &apos;s lessons to learn from the exception , the exception that we know very well today from the disco@@ ver@@ ies we &apos;ve made , and many other sch@@ ol@@ ars have made around the world .
you might know that , so far in just the da@@ wn of this revolution , we know that there are perhaps 4@@ 0,000 unique mu@@ tations affe@@ cting more than 10,000 genes , and that there are 500 of these genes that are bon@@ a-@@ fi@@ de dri@@ vers , caus@@ es of cancer .
and i don &apos;t even ask about those issues because there &apos;s nothing i can do .
but the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5,000 , which i personally don &apos;t believe , but then i am a s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic .
kb : what i didn &apos;t show you was -- you got that s@@ w@@ inging thing going ?
so it &apos;s taken me almost a year to gain access into these places .
in the evening , i went to speak with the bo@@ s@@ ses at the head@@ quar@@ ters , and i told them -- i lied -- i told them , &quot; listen , we are going to start a couple of hours per day , just a few re@@ pa@@ irs . &quot;
now , if you think about how our world got so ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated , the usual suspe@@ cts re@@ ar their heads .
cam@@ ille se@@ a@@ man : photos from a stor@@ m ch@@ aser
she was eventually audi@@ tioned for the royal bal@@ let school ; she became a sol@@ o@@ ist ; she had a wonderful career at the royal bal@@ let . she eventually gradu@@ ated from the royal bal@@ let school and fo@@ unded her own company -- the gil@@ lian lyn@@ ne dance company -- met andrew l@@ loy@@ d we@@ ber . she &apos;s been responsible for some of the most successful musi@@ cal theater produ@@ ctions in history ; she &apos;s given pleas@@ ure to millions ; and she &apos;s a multi@@ -@@ million@@ ai@@ re . somebody else might have put her on medi@@ cation and told her to cal@@ m down .
let me tell you , this was a strange way to s@@ have , because i thought about it and i realized that the way i was sha@@ ving then would be the way i would s@@ have for the rest of my life -- because i had to keep the wid@@ th the same .
one of those kids tu@@ tors math on the far side of town .
it can be comp@@ iled into this -- into zer@@ os and ones -- and pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced by a computer .
but anyway .
and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple fol@@ ks from silicon valley , fly them to uganda , buy a car , set up the first internet connection at the national library of uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in ru@@ ral uganda .
many of you might know that the po@@ ta@@ to chip chair by charles and ray e@@ ames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fi@@ ber@@ glass was available for civili@@ an use all of a sudden .
this is just the weight versus the age .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corpo@@ ra@@ tions to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stor@@ es , we wouldn &apos;t need to go s@@ ne@@ aking around the back , opening up b@@ ins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
if you go to the sa@@ far@@ i parks on saturn or jupiter , you will be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
ven@@ ice is sin@@ king . to save it , ra@@ ch@@ el arm@@ strong says we need to out@@ grow architecture made of in@@ ert materials and , well , make architecture that gro@@ ws itself . she pro@@ poses a not@@ -@@ quit@@ e-@@ alive material that does its own re@@ pa@@ irs and sequ@@ est@@ ers carbon , too .
if we could , would we ?
and since there are many genetic vari@@ ants , and they have different such gra@@ dients , this means that if we deter@@ mine a dna sequence -- a genome from one individual -- we can quite ac@@ cur@@ ately esti@@ mate where that person comes from , provi@@ ded that its parents or grand@@ parents haven &apos;t moved around too much .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 18@@ 00 .
so this technology , 3d printing , and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight , which is the biggest issue in air@@ craft design , because it &apos;s directly lin@@ ked to greenhouse gas emissions .
they mes@@ h@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ led 300 bu@@ ses and they speak to these smart termin@@ als .
he does not seem to be brea@@ thing .
ok . another person . oh , i for@@ got , i shouldn &apos;t shu@@ ff@@ le but i think -- -- actually , my techni@@ que is to pe@@ ek , all the time .
in other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
the descri@@ ption perfectly cap@@ tured ed@@ wards &apos; personal van@@ ity .
so , we &apos;ve invented ourselves . of all the animals that we have dom@@ est@@ icated , the most important animal that we &apos;ve dom@@ est@@ icated has been us . okay ?
and so we wa@@ ited , we sat at the tab@@ les , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited .
in the world of the middle east at the moment , the deb@@ ates are , as you know , shri@@ ll .
and we wanted it to be easy to use .
now , this is a little illusion .
i can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it sta@@ ys here -- don &apos;t move -- i will try to ro@@ tate the tra@@ ck , and hopefully , if i did it corre@@ ctly , it sta@@ ys su@@ spen@@ ded .
now radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives .
the cer@@ am@@ ics designer ev@@ a zei@@ sel looks back on a 7@@ 5@@ -@@ year career . what ke@@ ep@@ s her work as fres@@ h today as in 192@@ 6 ? her sense of play and beauty , and her drive for adv@@ enture . listen for stories from a rich , color@@ ful life .
and so whether they &apos;re helping us to become creative and innovative , or whether they &apos;re helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance , or whether they are our tru@@ sted si@@ de@@ k@@ ick who &apos;s helping us at@@ tain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves , for me , robots are all about people .
what &apos;s crazy is what we do today .
it has a second meaning , which is to send money as air@@ time . ok ?
because i introdu@@ ced a conflict between the word itself and its color .
they can expect to have a lot of forms and fun@@ ctions within the practice of architecture .
they just go ahead and start a fund@@ rais@@ er .
re@@ use of sy@@ ring@@ es , all too common in under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed clinics , kill@@ s 1.@@ 3 million each year . mar@@ c ko@@ sk@@ a clu@@ es us in to this deva@@ stat@@ ing global problem with facts , photos and hid@@ den-@@ camera foot@@ age . he shares his solution : a lo@@ w-@@ cost sy@@ r@@ inge that can &apos;t be used twice .
we do that by doing active learning in the class@@ room .
some people say it &apos;s happy .
in the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my interest and passion for transi@@ tional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squ@@ at@@ ter camp outside dur@@ ban .
why are you so passionate ? &quot;
things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient &apos;s room so that it signi@@ fied , &quot; this is my room . this is my personal space &quot; -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem .
we don &apos;t have to rein@@ v@@ ent the whe@@ el .
there is the affe@@ ctive compon@@ ent , which is , &quot; i feel for you . &quot;
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually rep@@ licated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
ok . so , the patient was treated then with a thir@@ d-@@ generation cep@@ hal@@ o@@ spor@@ in antibio@@ tic and do@@ x@@ y@@ cy@@ c@@ line , and on day three , it didn &apos;t help : she had pro@@ gr@@ essed to ac@@ ute failure .
they began to think of an es@@ cap@@ e route from this pris@@ on@@ er &apos;s di@@ le@@ m@@ ma , and we developed concep@@ ts of collective action , basically trying to bring various competi@@ tors together around the table , expla@@ ining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they si@@ mul@@ taneously would stop bri@@ bing , and to make a long story short , we managed to eventually get ger@@ many to sign together with the other o@@ ec@@ d countries and a few other expor@@ ters .
and very often i &apos;ve been an out@@ si@@ der .
they can actually also move towards the light . you have to just choose your species .
there &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive .
and we have most who lived in absolute poverty were asi@@ ans .
and then you get an f@@ mr@@ i speci@@ alist , and you get frank wil@@ son , and you get other kinds of hard scientists , including neuro@@ en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologists .
so of course whatever you don &apos;t really do yourself doesn &apos;t really get done proper@@ ly .
i knew i had to do anything i could to ear@@ n some money to support the people i care about . &quot;
s@@ j : i don &apos;t think it &apos;s there .
that has mostly happened in my life@@ time .
it seem@@ ed that for our neighbors and friends , africa was either this ex@@ o@@ tic place , this imag@@ in@@ ary land that probably exists only in their imagination , or the place of hor@@ ror , fam@@ ine .
she &apos;s pre@@ g@@ nant and a wi@@ do@@ w .
and when it starts f@@ las@@ hing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the le@@ ds that &apos;s f@@ las@@ hing very fast .
well , first one , analy@@ tic skills .
so we pick it up , we put it on a table where there &apos;s two food re@@ wards , but in this case only the one on the right gets food .
i read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs , and the auth@@ or found that these people shared a hab@@ it that he called &quot; productive par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , &quot; which meant that these people , instead of dis@@ missing their fe@@ ars , these people read them clo@@ sely , they studied them , and then they transl@@ ated that fear into prepar@@ ation and action .
and i hat@@ ched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
so this thing right here is fre@@ aking me out .
nothing . they don &apos;t talk about us . they don &apos;t talk about the coal .
the kitchen is 25 gr@@ and a month . okay ?
i &apos;m not ready for jo@@ in@@ t replac@@ ement . &quot;
so they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries .
but geck@@ os do it better .
so for the subway in new york , i saw a cor@@ respon@@ dence between ri@@ ding the subway and reading .
and that &apos;s the area again .
the great depression made not a dent in this exponenti@@ al pro@@ gr@@ ession .
and over the past few days , many of you have been asking me , &quot; how did you come to this ? how did you get started doing this ? &quot;
so , let &apos;s start off in china .
u@@ bun@@ tu is at play right now .
we might get two or three dead sharks was@@ hed up in ireland a year , if we &apos;re kind of lucky .
it was a di@@ m@@ ly li@@ t sha@@ ck .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analy@@ ze the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic tra@@ ces of de@@ ception .
the fra@@ mers gave us what they called a re@@ public , but by a re@@ public they meant a represent@@ ative democracy , and by a represent@@ ative democracy , they meant a government , as ma@@ dison put it in fe@@ der@@ alist 5@@ 2 , that would have a bran@@ ch that would be depen@@ dent upon the people alone .
of course , it also shr@@ in@@ ks the pump@@ ing equi@@ p@@ ment and its capital costs .
i was afraid to talk to my new bo@@ ss , but decided to muster up my courage .
and at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
and what can we learn from all of that ?
towards the end of their life , they become nearly free .
but it &apos;s ok that even though you &apos;re not h@@ yp@@ noti@@ zed , you will forget everything that happened .
so to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifest@@ yle , you also have to have won the genetic lot@@ tery .
and then , as the other ax@@ is ki@@ cks in , those actually blu@@ r into a volu@@ me .
thank you very much .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
what does it mean , &quot; d@@ ough becomes lea@@ ven &quot; ?
everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical vie@@ wer .
what you should in fact do is emplo@@ y all of the world &apos;s top male and female super@@ models , pay them to walk the leng@@ th of the train , hand@@ ing out free ch@@ at@@ e@@ au pe@@ tr@@ us for the entire du@@ ration of the journey .
we did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies .
we sig@@ ned with a major lab@@ el .
they are working so close to each other that there is hori@@ zon@@ tal trans@@ fer of dna .
i tell kids when they struggle through some u@@ ph@@ ill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really hel@@ ps to ignore the immedi@@ ate ob@@ stac@@ les and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ st@@ a around you gro@@ ws .
so we &apos;ve created , using our super@@ computer , the world &apos;s best computer model of malaria , which we &apos;ll show you now .
i was thro@@ wn out of a car , roll@@ ed several times .
it &apos;s called subtext .
here &apos;s more good news . the cities sup@@ porting k@@ yo@@ to in the u.s .
but we esti@@ mate that about one in three bit@@ es of food we eat is directly or indi@@ re@@ ctly pol@@ lin@@ ated by hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es .
&quot; good call , tu@@ ll@@ es . from now on , you guys hit this pi@@ le first . &quot;
of course , the memory is really huge .
the first version , in the back , that &apos;s stri@@ der i .
the to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste is out of the tube .
but au@@ dien@@ ces don &apos;t come to see the ma@@ gi@@ cian die , they come to see him live .
we &apos;ve created systems , which syste@@ matically privilege , encourage , one nar@@ row quad@@ rant of the human sou@@ l and left the others un@@ re@@ gar@@ ded .
i &apos;ve got a little experiment i want to try with you .
that &apos;s how it works .
we don &apos;t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
i &apos;m not suggest@@ ing that we need to be allo@@ wing g@@ uns and kni@@ ves into school .
ide@@ ally , you would not be satis@@ fied until you had actually done the work .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incre@@ mental sort of change .
so what is this ? i hear you all ask . no , i don &apos;t .
in this very short period of time , you know , whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online , or the last , you know , four or five years of being online all the time , our relationship to our surro@@ und@@ ings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided . you know , we &apos;re both looking inside the scre@@ ens and we &apos;re looking out in the world around us .
haven &apos;t heard back yet from se@@ c on all the details , but do you say , do you want to help partici@@ pate in this , provide the money that they need ? &quot;
what is it made of ?
in the po@@ st-@@ kat@@ r@@ ina er@@ a , we have still more in common .
somebody &apos;s story@@ telling . interactive art . you can talk to me .
ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mur@@ u@@ gan@@ anth@@ am : the thing i saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; why are you using that na@@ sty cl@@ oth ? &quot;
a king ? a god ?
but if another language can think that thought , then , by co@@ oper@@ ating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
living systems are in const@@ ant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical re@@ actions called met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m .
so i thought , &quot; du@@ h , ro@@ bin , this is the difference between industrial production and pe@@ er production . &quot;
i wish you all the best of lu@@ ck in main@@ ta@@ ining that balance in your future en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s .
but nobody was interested in listening to it , you see , until i met k@@ is@@ hor@@ e bi@@ y@@ an@@ i of the future group .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
when you want to high@@ light a word , please don &apos;t waste your life dra@@ g@@ ging across it with the mouse like a new@@ bie .
as the auth@@ or of the study told me , children who have a sense of -- they &apos;re part of a larger narra@@ tive have greater self-@@ confidence .
you often see them in situations like this , or like this , and there &apos;s no dou@@ bt that young people are very comfortable and familiar brow@@ sing and ch@@ at@@ ting and tex@@ ting and g@@ am@@ ing .
first of all , i &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
this is a culture that has y@@ i@@ el@@ ded ell@@ s@@ worth wh@@ are@@ ham .
we need the best and the bri@@ ght@@ est from many different discipl@@ ines to come and join this effort -- all ages , all different groups -- because this is the time , fol@@ ks .
we fill our head with distra@@ ction , with bu@@ sy@@ ness , so that we don &apos;t have to ask , am i well ? am i happy ? are my children growing up right ?
you had to do everything to get your phone .
angel@@ ine had been moving from one place -- because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father -- moving from one grandmother &apos;s house to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . she had no st@@ ability in her life .
and so from social networks to soci@@ able robots , we &apos;re designing technologies that will give us the illusion of comp@@ ani@@ on@@ ship without the dem@@ ands of friend@@ ship .
a bed@@ room , the place where people share inti@@ macy , where life itself is conc@@ ei@@ ved , became a bat@@ t@@ le@@ field .
it was very br@@ ute force ; it was very in@@ elegant .
so what i did hear , once in a while , was that people wanted a lo@@ an -- i thought that so@@ unded very reas@@ on@@ able and really exciting .
and we &apos;re taking van@@ ity and sho@@ ving it down here .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
we need mathemati@@ cians to come in and simu@@ late this , to do mon@@ te car@@ l@@ o things to understand how these tools comb@@ ine and work together .
and the one i &apos;m working on right now , which is -- because i &apos;m right in the middle of it , and these for some reason cho@@ ke me up like crazy -- is a game called mexi@@ can kitchen workers .
we see the result , the tra@@ ces , if you like , of the bac@@ ill@@ us pa@@ steu@@ ri@@ i being har@@ n@@ essed to sc@@ ul@@ pt the desert into these hab@@ itable environ@@ ments .
sam martin : claim your &quot; man@@ space &quot;@@ <T_3> i wanted to tell <T_5> about <T_1> the amazing <T_0> i was seeing <T_7> , <T_6> wild@@ life <T_4> interesting <T_2> .
<T_3> suther@@ land &apos;s <T_2> , <T_4> don &apos;t use large , <T_0> projects that take <T_1> years .
<T_1> , we <T_3> that now is <T_2> time to <T_0> we &apos;re <T_4> .
and <T_2> of the super-@@ absor@@ ben@@ cy of <T_0> kind of <T_5> , <T_3> just takes <T_1> , <T_4> a really <T_6> one at that .
<T_4> example , <T_3> garden spider <T_0> make seven <T_2> kinds <T_1> sil@@ ks .
<T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_2> saw this actually <T_0> a problem : this <T_4> to differenti@@ ate <T_1> but keep them <T_3> .
we <T_0> 8@@ 1 units of <T_1> government .
<T_2> are <T_3> of me@@ mes that come out <T_0> the <T_1> .
so <T_3> many ways , i think <T_0> the <T_5> con@@ sen@@ sus <T_6> the whole discussion of <T_4> as <T_2> defen@@ se for boring <T_1> .
so , i don &apos;t tell you that to <T_1> ; <T_6> tell you because <T_4> &apos;m proud <T_8> human <T_5> , <T_7> they get excited to <T_9> once they &apos;ve had the <T_2> to experience <T_3> , not talk <T_0> it .
<T_1> up is <T_0> .
<T_1> , to find out <T_0> there was no <T_3> cl@@ aus at all <T_4> actually sort of <T_2> re@@ lief .
i &apos;ve got to say , one of the <T_4> exciting <T_5> about my <T_3> is <T_2> i get to , and i <T_1> to introduce you to <T_0> of those .
<T_2> need <T_4> new min@@ d@@ set . the <T_0> is <T_1> , but -- but -- but not <T_3> bottom <T_5> .
i s@@ lam@@ med <T_0> the <T_1> .
so <T_4> cam@@ bri@@ an explosion , <T_5> all the body <T_1> of the animals were <T_6> , <T_3> only 10 million <T_2> . <T_7> was <T_0> times faster .
you then <T_0> to introduce <T_4> mosquit@@ oes , and <T_3> have <T_6> model <T_1> and how they <T_2> and <T_5> .
vote <T_0> your wal@@ lets .
<T_0> is <T_1> too simpli@@ stic .
the <T_2> was <T_0> running over sand , and we turned <T_4> we <T_3> to make our <T_1> up@@ stream .
what are <T_0> charac@@ teri@@ stics of <T_1> top <T_2> ?
<T_1> &apos;re human <T_0> .
<T_2> i &apos;m <T_0> to <T_1> you this in 3d .
<T_0> if you give them <T_3> that <T_4> dop@@ am@@ ine <T_1> , <T_2> go away .
now i <T_0> have used a t@@ one which <T_7> more like a d@@ are than <T_3> requ@@ est <T_9> — but <T_1> , it &apos;s <T_8> this man &apos;s cre@@ dit and <T_5> courage <T_2> he said , &quot; <T_4> , <T_6> will . &quot;
so <T_5> evening , he <T_6> , &quot; <T_7> , <T_2> are doing <T_0> these <T_1> , but <T_4> &apos;t it nice , <T_3> , to build something <T_8> ? &quot;
<T_6> takes <T_8> water <T_9> of the <T_7> , r@@ uns it through <T_3> stone be@@ ds -- this is <T_5> to be <T_1> in there -- and <T_2> sort of <T_4> the garden <T_0> it .
<T_1> the <T_0> .
you <T_0> over with it .
in <T_7> words , we have <T_3> st@@ um@@ bled upon <T_4> hol@@ y <T_0> of modern day <T_5> exploration , <T_2> in other words , an environment that is <T_6> su@@ itable <T_1> living organisms .
<T_4> so , <T_3> ago , i got <T_2> idea <T_0> a <T_1> system .
<T_1> were <T_0> of tre@@ a@@ ties .
wake up .
and <T_0> , there <T_3> many of <T_2> things that <T_1> to happen .
<T_1> the <T_4> themselves <T_6> quite <T_3> , but <T_5> you <T_9> that <T_8> precisely tun@@ ed to the right <T_2> , <T_0> atom will <T_7> absor@@ b those phot@@ ons and tend to s@@ low down .
now you &apos;ve <T_2> seen <T_1> of neurons <T_0> .
i <T_1> for the new <T_7> , and i <T_0> covers , <T_6> 9 / 11 happened and <T_2> was , you <T_5> , a complete and <T_4> end of <T_9> world <T_3> we <T_8> it .
and , in a moment , we &apos;re going to see <T_0> view <T_1> the air@@ flow .
<T_2> also learn to <T_6> other people &apos;s <T_4> , because <T_5> people are <T_3> at is <T_0> they are <T_1> about .
and <T_1> they eat <T_0> seeds , <T_3> fo@@ ie <T_2> turns yellow .
so <T_0> are turning more towards <T_1> consumption .
the <T_1> revolution , <T_0> .
<T_8> want kids to <T_2> , <T_9> &apos;m <T_6> hero <T_3> waiting , <T_0> for <T_5> right <T_4> to <T_7> along , and i will <T_1> her@@ o@@ ically .
you <T_0> it <T_4> a music hall , <T_2> all of a <T_3> becomes a <T_1> .
and so at the time that we were doing <T_3> research , <T_4> was car@@ ing for <T_5> 2@@ 9 year-old fire@@ figh@@ ter <T_2> conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut who was very much at the end <T_1> life with this <T_0> cancer .
now , from <T_6> acade@@ my , we saw that <T_5> 10@@ -@@ minute <T_3> worked <T_0> better <T_4> trying to record <T_1> h@@ our@@ -@@ long le@@ cture <T_2> put it <T_8> the small@@ -@@ format <T_7> .
well , we <T_1> show <T_9> website instead , <T_4> all that <T_3> , <T_7> a fil@@ ler , and we became <T_0> famous <T_5> ic@@ eland , went to <T_2> and <T_6> about this <T_8> .
now , they will also <T_0> in certain <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;ve been a <T_1> f@@ an of enter@@ prise <T_2> entrepreneur@@ ship since <T_0> .
by the way , <T_4> wa@@ ges <T_0> libr@@ ari@@ ans went up faster <T_6> the <T_8> for other <T_5> in <T_9> u.s. over <T_3> same time <T_7> , <T_1> libr@@ ari@@ ans became part@@ ners <T_2> computers .
what you <T_1> here is <T_2> electron@@ ic <T_0> .
<T_0> actually live ... <T_1> day-@@ to-@@ day <T_4> comes from <T_3> , from <T_7> -- in fact , <T_6> the lab , we feed ours <T_9> -- <T_2> the <T_8> needs the <T_5> meal .
my <T_0> ro@@ om@@ mate <T_2> sho@@ cked by <T_1> .
you can <T_0> europe is <T_2> with <T_1> .
<T_0> does that work ? &quot;
<T_2> the cool <T_1> is the <T_0> .
<T_0> , <T_2> -- -- that &apos;s <T_1> truth .
well , <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> hard doing <T_1> calcu@@ lations , <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> problem .
<T_3> , <T_2> hear these in@@ fern@@ al <T_1> going <T_0> and day .
<T_1> began to <T_2> so hard that <T_4> buildings that were <T_0> me started to <T_5> like big animal <T_3> .
they <T_1> bigger <T_2> to shoot <T_0> down with .
<T_2> think <T_0> people agree with <T_1> .
<T_0> month , <T_1> was at <T_3> , and , <T_2> , that caf@@ e@@ teria , man .
<T_5> we have found working <T_3> the world <T_2> is <T_6> the <T_1> man &apos;s safety <T_0> , the best invest@@ ment , <T_7> school <T_4> .
<T_5> bring <T_2> who have hiv , who &apos;ve been through <T_8> p@@ mt@@ ct programs <T_6> the very facili@@ ties , to come <T_7> and <T_0> side by side with doctors and nur@@ ses <T_3> part of <T_1> health care <T_4> .
and <T_0> is <T_6> difficult to engage <T_4> in politics <T_3> they believe <T_1> what really matters is where <T_2> personally <T_5> .
<T_2> camer@@ on : the <T_0> age of <T_1>
so , <T_4> whole idea <T_2> really <T_0> let <T_3> happen <T_1> itself .
<T_3> if we are <T_1> environment , then all we <T_6> to do is look around us <T_0> see how <T_4> treat <T_2> and how we treat each <T_5> .
<T_5> had <T_3> friends and we <T_1> the won@@ ders of the <T_0> , like <T_4> , <T_6> and <T_2> ol@@ du@@ va@@ i gor@@ ge .
who &apos;s got the work eth@@ ic now ?
those <T_0> cap@@ tured in the char@@ ter .
so that if you <T_6> down on my chair , whether you &apos;re <T_9> feet <T_0> or six foot six , <T_2> always de@@ als with your weight and trans@@ f@@ ers the <T_8> of <T_5> requi@@ red <T_7> re@@ c@@ line <T_4> a way <T_1> you don &apos;t have to look for something <T_3> adjust .
<T_3> if <T_2> look at this <T_1> car@@ efully , <T_5> bottom <T_4> of this is rather <T_0> .
<T_4> was <T_2> pal@@ isa@@ des ; it <T_0> is <T_3> there , <T_1> there .
we <T_2> it <T_0> from us , and we <T_3> it free <T_4> the <T_1> .
<T_5> get gras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots <T_1> , <T_4> that <T_0> for people who have <T_3> capital or limited <T_2> .
i <T_4> that , if <T_6> can understand what <T_7> something <T_1> coca-cola <T_5> , <T_3> can apply those lessons then <T_0> the public <T_2> .
<T_1> phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical <T_0> is in deep <T_2> .
they <T_4> that <T_6> cells , taken <T_1> you and <T_2> , could <T_5> re@@ programm@@ ed back <T_0> em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic@@ -@@ like cells , which <T_9> ter@@ med i@@ ps <T_7> , or <T_8> pl@@ uri@@ po@@ tent <T_3> .
<T_0> re@@ mind <T_4> that <T_6> can change the <T_1> if we de@@ fy <T_3> impossible and we <T_2> to fear <T_5> .
and <T_5> &apos;d like to thank <T_4> for <T_2> opportunity to <T_0> our <T_3> with you , <T_1> soon <T_6> world .
so , <T_0> is <T_1> social result of <T_2> ?
<T_1> only has that <T_0> we@@ ak@@ . <T_2> &apos;s getting <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> the six <T_3> and <T_2> el@@ u@@ sive x-@@ factor .
it was <T_4> for <T_8> violence , <T_0> , look -- sun@@ glas@@ ses <T_3> those <T_7> co@@ ats , and , of <T_6> , they <T_5> walk up walls and do all these kinds of <T_2> that are <T_1> in the <T_9> world .
and <T_2> you want something that <T_0> your <T_1> .
<T_0> don &apos;t know . <T_1> . <T_2> knows ?
and i &apos;m <T_4> there <T_0> people here who probably know <T_2> than <T_9> do about <T_8> , <T_3> i can &apos;t <T_5> that every apartment having its own <T_1> condi@@ tion@@ er is a very <T_7> way to cool a <T_6> on this scale .
now you might look at this result and <T_0> , <T_6> , sure , on <T_1> people are <T_8> happy when <T_3> &apos;re mind-wandering , but sur@@ ely when <T_4> minds are stra@@ ying away from <T_2> that wasn &apos;t very enjo@@ y@@ able to <T_7> with , at least <T_5> mind-wandering should be doing something <T_9> for us .
thank <T_0> .
it &apos;s one <T_0> have to ask , and we have <T_1> start ans@@ wer@@ ing .
<T_7> has <T_4> book , &quot; <T_0> thought <T_5> the liber@@ al <T_6> , &quot; and <T_3> liber@@ al <T_8> , <T_2> defin@@ es as 19@@ th century and <T_1> 20th century .
bu@@ zz@@ car <T_1> people r@@ ent out their <T_3> cars to <T_0> friends and <T_2> .
<T_2> know <T_1> &apos;re not <T_0> angry , always <T_4> , <T_3> gener@@ ous .
<T_3> you &apos;d have to start a <T_2> categ@@ ory , <T_4> between <T_1> and <T_0> .
<T_5> one of these <T_7> is <T_3> co@@ g , <T_6> st@@ ack <T_0> co@@ gs , and <T_1> thing <T_4> as big as <T_2> ste@@ am lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive .
<T_2> : <T_0> just take off <T_3> ci , <T_1> i don &apos;t hear <T_4> .
<T_2> : <T_1> , there &apos;s <T_0> fif@@ th hypo@@ thesis .
so <T_3> , <T_5> decided to take <T_8> colum@@ n , and we decided to <T_6> it <T_4> a la@@ y@@ ered model , <T_1> out of <T_0> many <T_7> , <T_2> stac@@ ked over each other .
all right , so the <T_5> line is <T_1> : because of <T_3> increase in speed , and because of the <T_4> amount of hab@@ itable real <T_2> in the co@@ smo@@ s , i figure we &apos;re <T_8> to <T_0> up <T_6> sign@@ al within two <T_7> years .
well , i &apos;ll tell <T_0> -- <T_1> lot .
<T_0> , i &apos;m going to , like , go through <T_3> sli@@ des from way <T_2> when , and walk through them to give you a <T_4> of how <T_1> end up here .
so <T_7> next <T_4> you type a <T_0> , these words <T_8> you &apos;re typ@@ ing <T_1> actually words that are coming <T_2> books that are <T_3> di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed <T_6> the computer <T_5> not recognize .
thank <T_0> .
<T_4> , <T_3> about the <T_0> must be changing as <T_1> col@@ ony gets <T_2> .
for <T_9> years , <T_4> we <T_6> found ourselves reporting images of destruction , <T_1> of kill@@ ing , <T_2> se@@ ct@@ arian <T_7> , images <T_5> violence , emerging <T_3> a mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent piece of <T_0> , a region that one day was the <T_8> of civili@@ zations and art and culture for thousands of years .
<T_4> took <T_0> treatment , and on <T_2> way back , <T_3> dro@@ ve the <T_1> by himself .
<T_1> somehow <T_0> am@@ in@@ o <T_3> are comb@@ ined , and <T_2> begins .
<T_3> if we look <T_1> the history <T_2> law@@ ns , it &apos;s actually rather <T_0> .
<T_3> : absolutely . <T_5> this <T_0> something that <T_2> re@@ com@@ mend everyone in this <T_1> to <T_4> .
in particular , <T_4> 12 <T_2> ago we created <T_0> prepar@@ ation <T_3> we <T_1> bra@@ in-@@ machine inter@@ faces .
<T_2> soon , <T_1> computer learned , by <T_3> the monkey &apos;s <T_5> , to make <T_7> arm <T_6> the other <T_0> do <T_4> the <T_8> &apos;s arm did .
in my talk <T_0> , i &apos;ve <T_5> you a little bit <T_3> mind-wandering , <T_4> vari@@ able that i think <T_1> out to be fair@@ ly important <T_2> the equ@@ ation for happiness .
<T_1> one <T_0> of engineering that i <T_4> to leave <T_5> with as re@@ gar@@ ds <T_2> telescope is <T_3> mirror .
and <T_1> &apos;s a much <T_0> way to see .
but <T_1> me , &quot; <T_0> all the time &quot; <T_2> something deep@@ er , too .
rs : that &apos;s <T_0> right .
if you took <T_2> same technology <T_4> pil@@ oted <T_5> into one of <T_7> remote <T_6> , <T_1> the score was <T_0> percent , and , let &apos;s say , took that <T_3> to <T_9> percent -- that will be a <T_8> different thing .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> power <T_1> patient networks .
here india <T_1> look at what is happening <T_5> the west <T_4> el@@ se@@ where , and <T_0> at <T_2> needs to <T_3> done .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_3> video , made <T_8> myself at <T_1> o &apos;@@ clock in the <T_6> just <T_9> show you <T_4> my real <T_7> is . <T_5> never <T_0> that .
<T_0> point being <T_1> they &apos;ve developed cultural <T_2> .
so <T_1> &apos;s points , <T_0> these points are actually being cros@@ s-@@ refer@@ enced .
<T_3> it &apos;s also <T_1> collective <T_7> and <T_6> the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented <T_4> for obser@@ ving <T_0> makes people ti@@ ck and <T_5> and play <T_8> engage on <T_9> gr@@ and <T_2> in games .
and <T_4> &apos;m <T_1> by this <T_0> i &apos;ve been op@@ en@@ ly <T_3> now for quite <T_2> time .
they <T_1> &apos;t want to sell <T_0> supp@@ lies .

<T_6> i &apos;m going to <T_8> and do now <T_2> to square , in <T_3> head , <T_9> two-@@ dig@@ it numbers faster <T_5> they can do <T_1> their <T_0> , even using <T_7> shor@@ t@@ cut <T_4> .
and it &apos;s a sc@@ ary <T_4> as well . because when we <T_7> looking <T_8> the collective appe@@ ti@@ te <T_3> our <T_1> , <T_0> what we &apos;re doing to <T_5> landscape -- that , <T_9> me , is something that is a <T_2> so@@ ber@@ ing moment for <T_6> to con@@ temp@@ late .

now , one <T_3> to <T_5> the code <T_0> to <T_6> these <T_1> and figure out what they mean , <T_2> it &apos;s a <T_4> job , and we actually <T_7> &apos;t have a ro@@ se@@ tt@@ a stone yet .
<T_9> jordan &apos;s main form of <T_8> was to take an <T_0> created in a well-@@ equi@@ pped <T_5> at <T_1> university <T_7> re@@ create it in <T_4> gar@@ age in chicago <T_6> only <T_2> materials and tools he made <T_3> .

so <T_0> high i@@ .@@ q .
we <T_1> that - <T_2> is a prime <T_0> .
<T_2> remember <T_1> talk all five culture <T_0> .
<T_8> in <T_0> , i started working for <T_5> company called inter@@ val <T_9> , which <T_1> just then being fo@@ unded <T_3> david li@@ d@@ ell and <T_2> allen <T_6> a for@@ -@@ profit research <T_7> in <T_4> valley .
<T_6> thing <T_0> is interesting is <T_5> the brain <T_1> that <T_3> have is shared with <T_4> variety of other <T_2> .
<T_0> go <T_3> , two , <T_2> , four , <T_1> .
<T_3> how do <T_1> think about materials <T_4> structure , sort of <T_2> an information <T_0> compu@@ tation problem ?
now <T_1> we &apos;re looking at <T_0> big <T_3> , we <T_4> to start thinking in <T_2> numbers .
and <T_2> number <T_1> present@@ ation <T_3> : never , ever look at <T_0> screen .
<T_1> heard <T_0> was <T_2> woman <T_3> who was treating people .
<T_1> don &apos;t <T_2> anyone <T_0> say yes .
one <T_0> is in <T_1> .
you <T_2> tell your de@@ ar@@ est , closest <T_3> , s@@ wor@@ n to <T_1> for life , the first time you had <T_0> .
<T_2> it &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ ar , <T_0> make <T_1> sp@@ her@@ ical <T_3> .
we <T_4> to <T_0> people <T_5> remember the com@@ passionate <T_2> , and <T_3> give gui@@ del@@ ines . <T_1> char@@ ter <T_7> not be a <T_6> docum@@ ent .
and <T_5> works for the <T_2> or the right , <T_9> works for the <T_6> and the right , <T_1> citizens of the left <T_8> right , because there <T_3> no <T_4> reform possible until <T_7> end this <T_0> .
some famous ones like <T_5> open <T_4> , which has 1@@ 10,000 students , the <T_2> of <T_8> third <T_0> , which has <T_7> half a million <T_6> people teaching <T_9> older <T_3> , as well as strange things like <T_1> gar@@ ages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs .
<T_9> the &quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; was , what if <T_0> could take bra@@ d pit@@ t , and we could put bra@@ d in this device , <T_6> use this cont@@ our <T_4> , and we could sti@@ pp@@ le on <T_2> phosphor@@ es@@ cent ma@@ ke@@ up and put him <T_5> the black <T_1> , and we could , in fact , scan him <T_3> real time per@@ forming <T_8> &apos;s fac@@ s <T_7> .
<T_0> onie : what if our <T_2> us <T_1> ?
well , because it gives <T_2> good , pa@@ ying <T_7> , <T_6> , <T_0> many african <T_5> , <T_1> opportunities to <T_3> from <T_4> .
well , <T_2> comes <T_5> franklin , <T_3> he comes <T_7> to <T_1> himself with <T_0> b@@ ol@@ t of electricity <T_4> the end of <T_6> ki@@ te .
but <T_8> do know <T_9> the self-@@ organization trend <T_0> the <T_5> is long , <T_4> it <T_6> with <T_1> like <T_7> ; they main@@ ta@@ ined <T_3> order for <T_2> of years .
you <T_1> do all those <T_0> things .
<T_0> do we get those people <T_3> to <T_2> that <T_1> ?
<T_1> want to talk about <T_0> , and <T_2> power that i see <T_3> in them .
so when <T_2> passi@@ ve <T_0> like <T_1> one seems to <T_3> alive , <T_4> it is -- wo@@ o@@ sh -- starting <T_5> move .
<T_1> people who <T_3> de@@ liber@@ ating -- &quot; <T_2> i return <T_0> ?
gets <T_1> wrong , you press <T_0> butt@@ on on the <T_2> box .
this <T_0> a <T_2> more <T_1> look at things .
but <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> ro@@ ad@@ block that <T_2> can &apos;t get <T_3> .
<T_0> what <T_1> it take ?
so , <T_3> message to <T_5> fol@@ ks , <T_6> my <T_1> minutes , is that i appreci@@ ate the chance to share this <T_7> you . <T_8> will be <T_9> . <T_2> love <T_4> at <T_0> .

and , like <T_0> gras@@ ses , at <T_1> certain <T_2> it puts out seeds .

<T_1> are <T_2> doing that ? <T_0> they expect <T_3> to follow .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> like <T_0> relation to <T_2> abstra@@ ct form .

there &apos;s a colle@@ ction of 10 <T_6> , some call them the li@@ ons , who <T_2> the last decade have had a com@@ bin@@ ation of 100 percent de@@ bt can@@ cell@@ ation , a <T_0> of aid , a ten@@ fold <T_7> in <T_1> -- that &apos;s foreign direct invest@@ ment -- <T_9> has un@@ lo@@ cked a quad@@ ru@@ pling <T_5> dom@@ esti@@ c resources -- that &apos;s local money -- which , <T_3> spent wi@@ sely -- that &apos;s good govern@@ ance -- cut childhood mortality by a third , dou@@ bled education comple@@ tion rates , and they , <T_4> , hal@@ ved extreme <T_8> , and at this rate , these 10 get to zero too .

<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> qui@@ cker to do that and more <T_1> .
and <T_5> know what <T_0> are like <T_7> they &apos;ve been as@@ le@@ ep for like an <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_6> they took <T_1> v@@ ali@@ ums -- you know , they &apos;re all over the <T_4> .

if they have <T_3> hi@@ p <T_0> we go with <T_4> and we <T_1> their <T_2> dis@@ charge experience .
<T_1> hardly get <T_0> , and <T_2> they do it &apos;s <T_3> as <T_4> .
so let &apos;s try to look at it <T_1> a <T_0> perspective .
<T_1> say we <T_0> &apos;t <T_4> to . <T_5> say <T_2> can &apos;t <T_3> not to .

so <T_0> aid is actually a great way of sort of wra@@ pping up <T_7> , <T_3> if <T_8> think <T_2> it , what <T_5> &apos;ve been talking <T_6> today is this notion -- very <T_9> am@@ ong@@ st econom@@ ists -- that <T_4> things are <T_1> hom@@ e-@@ bi@@ as@@ ed .

and i was <T_3> home from <T_8> , and a truck was <T_0> the op@@ posite direction , came over <T_6> my <T_5> , <T_4> over <T_1> top of my car and <T_9> ax@@ le <T_7> my <T_2> off .
how do <T_0> know which <T_1> i <T_2> ?
well , there &apos;s <T_3> fantastic <T_0> here to <T_2> up , <T_4> pil@@ oted <T_1> africa , actually .
and with <T_1> pictures , <T_2> hope that we can <T_0> information , a system of information .
<T_3> is <T_1> sort of mis@@ con@@ ception no@@ wadays that it &apos;s all been done in <T_2> fields <T_4> exploration <T_0> adv@@ enture .
this sort of <T_5> has been going on for <T_2> , <T_9> , <T_0> million <T_1> , and <T_7> can &apos;t step in <T_6> say , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> , and that &apos;s <T_8> . &quot;
now <T_3> people might <T_9> email is <T_4> distra@@ cting and i@@ .@@ m@@ . is <T_6> distra@@ cting , <T_7> these <T_5> things are really <T_0> , <T_8> they &apos;re distra@@ cting at <T_2> time of your own choice and your own <T_1> .
so <T_2> believe <T_0> kept me <T_1> .
so <T_4> goes against <T_0> conventional <T_5> that we should tell <T_1> friends <T_3> goals , right -- so <T_2> hold us to it .
it was <T_0> head that <T_2> bald -- and comfortable now without a <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> cool .
<T_0> am@@ ar@@ y@@ lli@@ s <T_1> looking really three-@@ dimensional .
and i <T_0> . they <T_1> !
it <T_0> have the inter@@ discipl@@ in@@ arity <T_1> the ted <T_2> .
we are <T_0> the <T_3> that is going to create <T_6> new <T_1> experience , <T_4> will <T_2> the new <T_5> .

and <T_0> finally , you &apos;re asking for <T_1> money , <T_4> just <T_5> it &apos;s my <T_3> , <T_2> because it &apos;s me .
chinese had <T_1> technologies <T_3> steel , <T_0> , <T_2> .
<T_1> we &apos;ve got to get them all right , because if we solve 11 , we fa@@ il to solve the 12@@ th -- <T_9> &apos;re in <T_0> . for example , if we solve <T_4> problems <T_7> water <T_2> soil and <T_8> , but don &apos;t solve our problems of <T_5> , then <T_6> are in <T_3> .
<T_2> at all <T_1> stuff <T_3> &apos;s here for <T_0> cam@@ p@@ fire .
<T_4> of the things <T_1> my inter@@ n here , pr@@ at@@ es@@ h , <T_3> is a <T_0> app@@ lication , which can now send all this <T_5> anywhere <T_2> wants to go .
<T_2> was <T_3> to <T_1> . and it &apos;s a <T_0> game .
<T_0> to me <T_1> &apos;s wrong .
now i <T_3> for <T_6> of you who are <T_1> , this <T_2> is not very <T_5> , <T_0> stick with me <T_4> .
we pose <T_3> threat <T_0> the <T_2> of the <T_1> .
on one vancou@@ ver <T_7> , we <T_4> out on <T_8> campus <T_1> university of <T_3> columbia <T_0> we appro@@ ached <T_5> and said , &quot; do you <T_6> to be in <T_2> experiment ? &quot;
and the <T_1> is : i <T_0> them from <T_2> .
so <T_2> is <T_1> internet <T_0> have in <T_3> .
<T_1> come back <T_0> , <T_2> for air .
so when <T_2> are working on <T_3> , <T_4> can start building <T_1> whenever they <T_0> .
so <T_0> you &apos;re <T_5> is several hundred molecules <T_3> through <T_2> air , <T_4> your <T_1> .
<T_3> we <T_2> the <T_4> , and how we treat <T_5> other is really how <T_1> &apos;re <T_6> to treat <T_0> environment .
<T_2> the men were all <T_3> war@@ ri@@ ors <T_0> with <T_1> .
so <T_1> we <T_7> to find a <T_3> way of doing that <T_0> of work , <T_2> need look only no <T_5> than africa to find <T_4> robust self-@@ organi@@ zing <T_6> .
they actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like lo@@ w-@@ th@@ res@@ hold <T_7> activi@@ ties that i think are the <T_6> to bringing up some of our <T_0> social <T_1> that <T_5> &apos;re <T_2> . and very , <T_9> quickly -- i <T_3> pu@@ ppe@@ ts . <T_4> &apos;s a <T_8> .

because <T_2> &apos;s so <T_0> to ad@@ mit <T_1> own fal@@ li@@ bility .
<T_1> you mind <T_0> asking <T_2> question ? &quot;
the <T_2> is though <T_1> i wanted to explain <T_3> you <T_8> this really <T_9> -- <T_5> i can have four of <T_4> on my <T_0> , <T_7> you would not to be able to <T_6> see them .
we <T_1> the patients <T_0> two <T_2> .
<T_0> only <T_2> the <T_3> did <T_1> see the big picture .
so , bo@@ b <T_4> , like all <T_3> , he <T_8> melo@@ dies <T_5> he trans@@ formed them , he comb@@ ined <T_7> with new <T_6> which were <T_0> their <T_2> con@@ co@@ ction <T_1> pre@@ vi@@ ous stuff <T_9>
<T_9> ted@@ global 2010 , auth@@ or ma@@ tt <T_0> shows how , <T_7> history , the <T_1> of human progress has been the <T_6> and ma@@ ting of ideas <T_5> make new ideas . it &apos;s <T_2> important how <T_3> individuals <T_8> , he says ; what really matters is how smart the collective brain <T_4> .
it <T_0> a lot of <T_1> .
<T_3> i make <T_4> fla@@ ps <T_0> , <T_2> can use a bit less <T_1> .
<T_1> , so <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> &apos; 9@@ 6 . here &apos;s in <T_0> .
homo <T_3> made <T_0> same tool <T_1> 3@@ 0,000 <T_2> .
so my <T_0> ar@@ mor , john ma@@ eda <T_1> without any <T_2> , came out with this big <T_5> on <T_3> video games <T_6> mom@@ a <T_4>
everyone was very <T_0> about <T_6> arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological find , <T_2> it meant that <T_5> might <T_4> be able to <T_3> a single <T_1> skelet@@ on .
<T_3> the second <T_1> comes <T_2> line , &quot; the wind <T_0> waves <T_4> him . &quot;
by <T_2> students <T_1> stand@@ ford university <T_0> an extreme <T_3> project that they had , basically .
so <T_6> move around the <T_4> on <T_2> display , <T_3> you can <T_1> feel <T_0> it is just from <T_7> weight of the <T_5> .
<T_8> what happens then is not that our consciousness <T_0> , it exp@@ ands , <T_7> that those <T_6> days in paris seem to be more full of <T_2> and experience <T_1> all <T_5> months of being a <T_3> , talking , <T_9> meet@@ ing-@@ atten@@ ding <T_4> back home .
with <T_9> and <T_1> dr@@ ying up because <T_8> over@@ -@@ u@@ sage , ro@@ b har@@ mon <T_0> imple@@ mented an in@@ gen@@ ious market mechan@@ ism to bring <T_7> the water . farmers <T_6> be@@ er <T_4> find their f@@ ates inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed <T_3> the <T_2> cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old <T_5> of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but <T_0> else could <T_1> offer her ?
<T_6> core <T_8> that were put in place in 199@@ 8 <T_1> their modi@@ fi@@ cations in <T_2> and 2008 <T_7> highly <T_0> and allowed <T_5> conflict par@@ ties to <T_3> their <T_9> and <T_4> addres@@ sed .
they <T_2> as just sort of a <T_0> organization that <T_3> in s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ing <T_1> the u.s .
and <T_3> i see <T_2> these h@@ ex@@ ag@@ ons <T_0> complex things , <T_8> i also have , <T_9> visual migra@@ ine , <T_5> wonder <T_7> everyone sees things like this , and whether things <T_6> ca@@ ve art <T_4> or@@ nam@@ ent@@ al art may have been der@@ i@@ ved from them <T_1> bit .
<T_1> it <T_2> -- look <T_0> these <T_3> .
i mean <T_4> is <T_5> for an <T_3> , for <T_2> architect , to become <T_1> an <T_6> and <T_0> le@@ gend in their own time .
<T_5> , i do <T_0> . <T_1> know <T_3> it is , <T_6> i <T_2> before <T_4> then i do <T_7> .
so first , we demo@@ lish <T_0> .
john <T_2> : our <T_0> condition -- <T_1>
well , how <T_2> bot@@ t@@ les is <T_1> before you tell me <T_3> i have <T_0> problem ?
and , in fact , the <T_2> that make <T_3> into <T_4> gener@@ ators <T_5> discovered by <T_1> cambridge <T_0> .
<T_4> you <T_5> still also go <T_0> and <T_6> the <T_1> show in <T_3> universe , which is , of course , the <T_2> itself .
<T_5> two <T_1> after this <T_0> was done , <T_7> actually had our <T_8> project contra@@ ct , at <T_2> , on <T_4> co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ches , which was very <T_6> to <T_3> .
now , what happens is , when <T_2> ou@@ ts@@ our@@ ce the bottom r@@ ung of the la@@ d@@ der to <T_3> for innovation <T_4> for r &amp; amp ; d work , at some <T_1> in the very near future you are going to have to <T_6> a problem , which is <T_9> does <T_7> next <T_8> of the <T_5> people come from within your <T_0> ?
even building co@@ des actually limit the <T_4> for us to <T_7> much <T_3> than four <T_5> in <T_2> places , and that &apos;s <T_1> here <T_6> the <T_0> .
<T_0> tried and tried and tried and <T_1> could <T_2> prove that it was true .
<T_2> showed <T_0> all of <T_1> can be put together .
i <T_0> quite a lot of <T_1> .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> building <T_6> it opened , <T_4> a chan@@ ne@@ l <T_1> down@@ town , and <T_2> seen <T_5> down@@ town .
<T_1> so <T_7> say that <T_0> want to build a game layer on <T_8> of <T_9> world , <T_3> that &apos;s not <T_2> true because it &apos;s <T_4> under <T_6> ; <T_5> &apos;s already happening .
and <T_5> led us <T_4> the <T_7> , <T_1> cour@@ thou@@ se , which is <T_3> a part of a <T_0> between tradition and <T_2> of the traditional <T_6> .
so <T_0> get im@@ mun@@ e <T_1> sounds that sc@@ are <T_2> after a@@ while .
<T_2> the connection is weak , <T_3> mot@@ ors will stay off <T_4> the <T_1> will <T_0> straight on <T_5> course .
<T_2> &apos;s letting <T_1> happen without thinking <T_0> it .
usually they <T_1> aw@@ ful . aw@@ ful <T_0> .
people <T_0> these to be more <T_3> ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ent if <T_2> &apos;ve been re@@ minded to was@@ h their <T_1> .
life is so <T_0> that <T_4> only get such <T_8> short time <T_2> experience <T_3> enjoy <T_1> those <T_7> little <T_6> that make it <T_5> swe@@ et .
<T_3> throughout the <T_4> , people are going directly <T_0> cell phones , <T_2> the whole <T_5> <T_1> .
our <T_1> are home to <T_2> of <T_0> , <T_3> these creatures define who <T_4> are .
so what <T_1> we <T_0> ?
but we <T_0> start out as <T_1> .
so , i &apos;d very much <T_1> to see <T_0> begin to really sei@@ ze <T_6> as an opportunity <T_2> get <T_5> into <T_3> medical <T_4> .
<T_5> these <T_1> in texas <T_0> with one another <T_2> achieve <T_9> mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones , <T_4> there <T_8> bon@@ uses and <T_7> other tre@@ ats that come if <T_6> beat the <T_3> schools .
<T_0> nature is <T_1> of the gener@@ ator , the <T_3> for this <T_2> .
<T_2> will be online <T_0> several <T_3> , probably next <T_1> .
and all things <T_7> equal , older people direct <T_4> cognitive <T_5> , <T_1> attention <T_0> memory , <T_6> positive <T_2> more than <T_3> .
well <T_0> the da@@ f-@@ 2 re@@ cep@@ tor <T_7> active , then it <T_3> a <T_1> of <T_5> that <T_2> fo@@ x@@ o from getting <T_8> the <T_4> where the <T_6> is .
i <T_1> ful@@ fill the <T_0> .
<T_7> within <T_5> week i had come to <T_4> that <T_2> second coming <T_3> chr@@ ist had occur@@ red , <T_8> it was <T_0> my@@ ung moon , and that i had been <T_6> cho@@ sen and prepared by <T_1> to be his <T_9> .
they don &apos;t <T_4> any <T_3> , they <T_1> &apos;t get any <T_2> for what they <T_0> .
she <T_0> us with <T_7> la@@ va man is <T_5> , <T_8> the <T_2> is coming , <T_6> then <T_9> there were <T_1> and trees , and <T_3> was very <T_4> .
<T_5> &apos;ve got maybe 10 seconds -- between 10 and <T_4> seconds , <T_2> on how <T_0> the pit@@ ch <T_1> -- to <T_6> their <T_3> .
<T_3> what he did was he <T_6> down <T_0> the <T_1> &quot; $ 8@@ 5,000 , &quot; <T_5> he said , &quot; <T_2> &apos;s <T_7> sal@@ ary , &quot; <T_8> then he <T_4> down &quot; $ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
and <T_3> c@@ oll@@ u@@ de . we <T_0> tests , or at least <T_2> britain , <T_5> that <T_1> pass <T_6> . <T_4> ?
that <T_9> was once <T_0> se@@ cul@@ ar <T_2> , <T_3> we had <T_8> , <T_5> this democracy was stolen from <T_7> by the <T_6> government , by <T_4> british <T_1> .
thank you .
we <T_1> to <T_4> our audience <T_2> what we &apos;re <T_0> about <T_3> .
didn &apos;t get much se@@ xi@@ er than the sp@@ ence <T_1> university , let <T_0> tell you .
<T_1> we <T_0> other advan@@ tages <T_3> the <T_2> k@@ ing@@ dom .
you know ? <T_0> she gave <T_2> best com@@ ment ever , and people turned <T_6> and <T_1> were like , oh <T_3> god , i <T_5> &apos;t even <T_4> her sitting there , you know ?
a distingu@@ ished no@@ se , with <T_3> lin@@ ed to <T_5> out <T_0> and du@@ st , and <T_4> gro@@ o@@ ve <T_1> cat@@ ches <T_2> .
the <T_1> here move <T_4> at a <T_0> of around <T_2> meters a <T_3> .
<T_3> &apos;s a free swi@@ mm@@ ing shark <T_1> a satellite tag <T_4> after <T_5> , sen@@ ding <T_0> its <T_2> .
<T_3> make <T_2> come alive with <T_1> , a lot of <T_0> .
they could <T_1> the <T_6> direction <T_0> which <T_5> want to generate an <T_8> for your <T_4> ima@@ gery , <T_2> you can <T_9> what <T_3> when you were at this we@@ dding , for <T_7> .
<T_1> in <T_5> mr@@ i and m@@ r spec@@ tro@@ scop@@ y here , <T_4> pro@@ state tumor activity <T_2> shown in red -- you can see <T_0> di@@ min@@ ishing <T_3> a <T_6> .
in <T_5> , in <T_0> parts of asia <T_9> in <T_8> america , <T_2> australi@@ a , wh@@ it@@ e-@@ c@@ oll@@ ar <T_3> are doing less of <T_4> kind of work , and <T_1> of this kind <T_6> work <T_7>
and <T_2> blue <T_1> developing countries are mix@@ ing up with <T_4> former <T_0> western <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;re not very <T_1> designed , <T_0> ?
<T_1> is from the <T_2> last <T_0> .
the <T_5> in <T_8> , <T_1> the satelli@@ tes <T_7> jupiter , is <T_2> times fa@@ in@@ ter than <T_4> is here , <T_6> jupiter <T_3> five times as far from the <T_0> .
and i <T_0> some <T_4> these <T_7> will enable <T_8> to be more <T_9> with <T_5> patients , and take more <T_1> and actually do the <T_6> human <T_2> elements of <T_3> , as au@@ g@@ mented by these sorts of technologies .
<T_1> the question <T_3> , who <T_2> go all the way to <T_0> vol@@ ts ?
but <T_9> new <T_5> about oil is the government doesn &apos;t have to force us to do pain@@ ful things to <T_6> off oil -- not just incre@@ ment@@ ally , but completely -- quite the <T_7> . the united states , for example , can completely elimin@@ ate <T_2> use of oil <T_0> re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate <T_8> economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it &apos;s so <T_4> che@@ ap@@ er to save and sub@@ stit@@ ute for the oil <T_3> to keep on <T_1> it .
so <T_1> actually have some <T_0> forward .
we <T_0> do <T_1> than that !
<T_4> should point out at <T_3> time -- <T_5> &apos;m <T_0> a sculp@@ tor ; <T_1> &apos;m a har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged model <T_2> .
now talking <T_3> e.@@ t@@ . putting us there , or some other <T_2> , just <T_0> the <T_1> further <T_4> .
&quot; do you <T_1> to corre@@ ct <T_0> mistakes ? &quot;
<T_3> was <T_1> philosop@@ her ; <T_4> was <T_0> drum player ; he was <T_2> teacher <T_5> excell@@ ence .
now , <T_1> is about <T_0> ris@@ ks , so this <T_2> an <T_3> risk , right ?
<T_4> came <T_0> to speak <T_3> ec@@ ology , and <T_6> em@@ it@@ ted as <T_5> co2 <T_2> a fren@@ ch@@ man in <T_1> year .
<T_5> than <T_0> or <T_6> internet <T_1> even that little <T_7> we keep talking about , the technology <T_2> &apos;re using the most almost every day <T_4> , your <T_3> .
<T_3> click <T_0> word . watch 200 . <T_2> go double <T_1> .
we <T_0> some of them this <T_1> .
and <T_3> other one was the <T_2> , a <T_0> , that <T_1> person had the <T_4> or not .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> word made of ?
so , this is <T_0> challenge <T_2> this <T_1> .
<T_3> , you can find <T_1> your je@@ ep , <T_2> cam@@ el , and a <T_0> .
<T_3> many <T_0> you <T_1> single ? any single <T_2> out there ?
<T_7> , we &apos;ve discovered the <T_2> , but <T_0> you understand the underlying <T_3> for <T_8> pattern -- you know , why it &apos;s built the <T_9> it <T_1> -- really you &apos;ve done stamp <T_5> . you <T_6> &apos;t done <T_4> .
<T_0> do you build a <T_1> health <T_2> system ?
fri@@ gor@@ is ? this <T_2> the <T_3> . <T_4> could live <T_0> one <T_1> .
thank you very much .
and <T_4> i <T_1> home , <T_3> i made a <T_0> of <T_2> hat .
in the <T_2> , <T_1> air <T_0> , <T_3> had th@@ ick walls .
and , if <T_8> all of the <T_6> systems <T_3> our galaxy were <T_0> of life , there <T_4> still 100 <T_2> other <T_7> out there , <T_5> 10 ^ 2@@ 2 <T_1> .
problems <T_0> puzz@@ les <T_2> ob@@ stac@@ les <T_1> .
<T_4> , i think , we copy our way <T_0> re@@ produce , you <T_6> what i <T_2> , and <T_3> of -- oh <T_1> , <T_5> it .
so every <T_1> you see <T_3> con@@ crete <T_2> like that , what you &apos;ve got to do is <T_0> open spac@@ es .
you <T_0> , we f@@ ought <T_4> to get at least <T_1> small pakistan@@ i <T_2> to <T_3> .
<T_6> about <T_5> place that artists can play <T_9> that -- that <T_4> the <T_8> of <T_1> and adv@@ oc@@ acy that <T_2> work towards , <T_0> working <T_7> young , black <T_3> .
<T_1> . <T_0> .
<T_0> have <T_1> idea <T_2> they do .
<T_5> can see <T_1> and con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions <T_2> large and small <T_4> in <T_3> and <T_0> places .
if necess@@ ary you <T_1> use babies <T_2> sell other <T_0> .
<T_4> all of the <T_1> come <T_0> one central port <T_2> the <T_3> .
<T_3> : <T_1> bo@@ y@@ sc@@ out tro@@ op <T_2> like to re@@ build <T_0> ma@@ il@@ boxes .
it <T_1> only <T_2> years <T_4> that we had the <T_0> of the <T_3> revolution .
<T_1> remember <T_2> you said to <T_0> .
<T_4> notion of <T_6> basically <T_2> down to one -- that <T_5> somebody <T_0> that they have <T_1> capacity <T_3> change <T_7> behavior .
again , what <T_5> tells us <T_1> suddenly <T_2> start thinking <T_4> both <T_3> of the <T_0> .
he &apos;s <T_3> five-@@ foot three <T_2> a half <T_1> a <T_0> day , standing <T_4> up@@ right in <T_5> .
he <T_1> me to use <T_5> like <T_2> ch@@ l@@ ori@@ de , <T_0> doesn &apos;t really work <T_4> voice ballo@@ ons <T_3> well .
he got <T_1> percent in <T_3> the important <T_2> , like <T_0> , for example there <T_4>
but <T_1> if i <T_3> permission <T_0> my <T_2> .
<T_5> pu@@ mp <T_2> flu@@ id <T_1> one of <T_4> systems , and <T_0> press <T_3> butt@@ on , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the <T_6> character .
so this <T_2> was taken <T_3> month <T_0> ryan with <T_1> iphone .
<T_1> some of <T_2> photographs <T_8> beautiful , and <T_3> wonder@@ ed , <T_0> it difficult for jo@@ el <T_6> to make <T_4> beauty <T_7> of such <T_5> ?
<T_6> began to talk <T_4> them <T_5> the <T_3> that <T_1> needed to <T_7> , <T_2> way of life <T_0> needed to nur@@ ture .
it &apos;s different <T_0> being <T_1> .
it &apos;s not saying <T_1> global warming is <T_0> happening .
i <T_1> in <T_8> recently , and <T_5> listen@@ ed to <T_3> &apos;s happening in <T_9> , and <T_6> &apos;s pretty <T_4> that they <T_0> catch up , <T_7> as japan <T_2> .
<T_2> looks <T_1> a <T_3> , <T_0> it &apos;s actually an <T_4> .
<T_4> way back , four and a half <T_1> years ago , <T_5> is <T_0> vast <T_2> soup <T_3> stuff .
now <T_2> disc@@ us@@ sed <T_1> with professor <T_3> bar@@ on-@@ co@@ hen who &apos;s the professor of develop@@ mental psychop@@ ath@@ ology <T_0> cambridge .
<T_2> were looking forward <T_5> re@@ building it , <T_7> eight <T_0> after <T_1> moved in , i suff@@ ered <T_3> stro@@ ke@@ -@@ like attack <T_4> by <T_6> birth de@@ fe@@ ct .
and <T_0> always <T_1> what happened <T_2> that <T_3> .
so going back <T_1> 198@@ 9 , i <T_0> a <T_2> suggest@@ ing <T_3> global hyper@@ text system .
and <T_3> opened many new <T_4> for <T_6> of female doctors <T_0> nur@@ ses and <T_1> and <T_5> , all of <T_2> have followed them .
<T_2> asked <T_1> to come <T_4> our lab <T_5> try and <T_3> out <T_0> was going on .
there <T_0> many <T_1> as well .
our <T_0> friend chris <T_3> about a <T_2> percent -- <T_1> with <T_5> bul@@ let , <T_4> might add .
so this <T_0> a <T_1> .
what we find is <T_3> the <T_6> says that <T_2> number of forward c@@ it@@ ations of a patent fil@@ ed <T_4> of a u.s. <T_5> &amp; <T_8> ; d sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary is identical to the number of forward c@@ it@@ ations of a patent fil@@ ed by <T_9> indian <T_1> of the same <T_7> within <T_0> company .
and there <T_2> 2,000 new <T_0> being built <T_1> to this power station .

and <T_0> had a <T_8> j@@ ar full of plac@@ e@@ b@@ o p@@ ills that he would give <T_4> , <T_9> he &apos;d <T_6> , &quot; <T_7> back <T_5> a <T_2> , if <T_3> still feel <T_1> . &quot;
<T_4> is at the <T_3> end of that <T_0> is for <T_1> audience to <T_2> out .

in about <T_7> months of rele@@ ase , we &apos;ve brought that <T_9> — in most <T_6> we &apos;re <T_5> with villa@@ ges here of <T_4> 2,000 , 3,000 people , <T_1> sort of size , starting small <T_0> we &apos;ve taken <T_2> mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to population down <T_8> about 85 percent in <T_3> four months .

<T_1> you &apos;re like <T_0> and you leave the <T_4> in the position of <T_5> even when you turn it on , and then <T_3> start to use <T_2> energy .
fal@@ se .
it &apos;s so <T_1> how <T_0> just <T_2> on .
every <T_0> animal is <T_1> than we are -- they have fan@@ gs , they have cla@@ ws , they have <T_2> , they have <T_3> .

here &apos;s another <T_4> from <T_0> : <T_6> . <T_2> think there &apos;s a food <T_1> , so <T_3> create new <T_5> .
and <T_8> &apos;t tell me it &apos;s from <T_2> guys and <T_6> co@@ a@@ ches <T_5> the <T_0> , because <T_3> women <T_1> my life are <T_7> on me <T_4> anyone <T_9> . &quot;
<T_1> worked at <T_0> electron@@ ics in the far@@ -@@ future <T_3> research <T_5> , <T_4> 20 <T_6> into <T_2> future .
this one i <T_0> i &apos;d show <T_1> .
<T_3> the cri@@ tic was <T_1> the op@@ tically activ@@ ated <T_6> , the <T_2> of this <T_0> should be a <T_5> in <T_4> .
on <T_5> shel@@ ves <T_4> home , we have <T_2> box set of the dv@@ d <T_6> &quot; <T_3> , &quot; season <T_0> to <T_1> prec@@ ise .
and let &apos;s <T_3> it &apos;s <T_1> foundation . they will <T_0> the <T_2> .
<T_1> hadn &apos;t de@@ alt <T_0> this kind of <T_6> or <T_3> , this <T_2> seg@@ ment of <T_5> medical <T_4> .
<T_4> &apos;s what i <T_1> for <T_3> time <T_5> open my <T_2> -- that impossible <T_0> .
so we &apos;re <T_1> to <T_0> for things with <T_2> that <T_3> have .
<T_0> business creates <T_1> when it &apos;s able to meet a need at a <T_2> .

and we <T_1> with <T_2> physical world with <T_0> hands .
and so then they &apos;re <T_2> sold in <T_1> store . this is <T_3> the <T_0> .
it <T_2> to evol@@ ve <T_0> oper@@ ated <T_6> one form <T_3> another <T_1> more and more <T_5> computers , <T_4> only <T_7> years ago .
now , they <T_3> very <T_1> , but they are <T_2> very <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> real simple example .
most are <T_1> , hea@@ vy <T_2> op@@ a@@ que , <T_0> stone or <T_3> .

<T_3> &apos;s actually <T_0> most used <T_1> on <T_2> website .
<T_0> you &apos;re <T_9> smart <T_1> , then , you <T_7> put <T_8> very expensive <T_5> that <T_6> will ever buy on the shel@@ f , because <T_2> the $ 3@@ 3 wine doesn &apos;t look <T_4> expensive in <T_3> .
here <T_1> los <T_0> , <T_3> the bay area in san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co , <T_2> became <T_4> de@@ du@@ cti@@ ble <T_6> the united <T_5> .
<T_3> went <T_1> a movie , we left <T_6> , <T_0> then <T_8> back to <T_4> room <T_5> ... &quot; <T_7> ca@@ ke -- just <T_2> piece of ca@@ ke .
we tried it <T_1> , first <T_3> lu@@ ton -- <T_2> for its <T_7> and not much else , <T_4> fear -- <T_5> in <T_9> -- <T_8> for <T_6> be@@ a@@ ches <T_0> lei@@ sure .
did <T_0> ever say <T_1> were <T_2> ? i was talking about <T_3> design . <T_4> me .
<T_2> are <T_1> the money side <T_0> the time .
do you know <T_0> this ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> about the <T_4> , <T_1> &apos;s how the <T_3> refle@@ ct light .
the <T_4> is <T_3> to build your <T_1> , or <T_2> net <T_0> .
<T_2> this was <T_4> more <T_3> . in fact , <T_6> &apos;s <T_5> is where <T_0> made his <T_1> .
i <T_2> , we need a <T_3> conference just <T_4> to telling <T_1> good <T_5> about the <T_0> .
<T_4> one <T_1> , 18@@ ,000 <T_3> , she had <T_2> do this win@@ ding to generate <T_0> s@@ are@@ es .
so , the <T_3> of the <T_0> cancer institute <T_2> that <T_1> is a genetic <T_4> .
i <T_2> not <T_4> , <T_5> it &apos;s very <T_0> for me <T_1> is going to <T_3> me .
but <T_0> &apos;ll <T_4> go inside our <T_1> , <T_2> with <T_3> biological neurons .
and <T_0> gra@@ y dots <T_5> sites that are also tracking <T_1> , but <T_3> have <T_4> idea <T_2> they <T_6> .

<T_0> &apos;re the <T_2> ones with <T_1> and democracy .
now , what i &apos;m going to do is <T_1> &apos;m going to re@@ view those <T_0> scen@@ es .
so one of the <T_0> is that <T_2> really <T_1> over .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> it would really mean to be <T_2> .
he is <T_4> in <T_5> we <T_1> as an animal , how <T_2> are <T_3> in mi@@ mi@@ cry and <T_0> .
<T_3> , al@@ ams -- <T_1> we call him for <T_2> -- is <T_0> ja@@ il .
it <T_2> made out of <T_3> , which <T_4> &apos;t a common <T_0> for movie <T_1> about <T_6> time the movie <T_5> made .
it <T_2> like we have a <T_6> of information problems in our <T_4> at the moment , from <T_9> over@@ lo@@ ad and the sat@@ u@@ ration <T_7> the break@@ down <T_1> trust and reli@@ ability <T_8> run@@ away s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ ism and <T_3> of transpar@@ ency , <T_5> even <T_0> interest@@ ing@@ ness .
<T_1> &apos;s sha@@ ping <T_0> new way of <T_2> .
<T_3> as <T_4> and <T_7> world <T_6> increasingly <T_0> there is a greater and greater <T_5> for other <T_1> to feel the <T_2> way i do .
third <T_1> is <T_0> when i get back <T_6> information it &apos;s not <T_4> got somebody &apos;s <T_3> and <T_5> and when they were born , <T_2> &apos;s got <T_7> .
but the biggest <T_0> we &apos;ve <T_2> to date , <T_9> is just <T_3> , <T_8> that we &apos;ve done a 2@@ 6@@ -@@ ep@@ is@@ o@@ de anima@@ ted <T_1> , which is done <T_5> global au@@ dien@@ ces : in fact , we &apos;re <T_7> going to be in <T_4> u.s. <T_6> tur@@ key , we know .
<T_1> come up with another <T_0> .
i love doing this work , because it really gives <T_5> people new hope <T_9> new choices that they didn &apos;t have before , and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just <T_1> , but <T_2> happiness is not -- we &apos;re talking about the pur@@ suit of happiness , but <T_4> you really look <T_3> all the spiritual tradi@@ tions , what al@@ dous hu@@ x@@ ley called the &quot; per@@ en@@ ni@@ al wisdom , &quot; when you get past the <T_6> and <T_0> and <T_7> that really divi@@ de people , it &apos;s really about -- our nature is to be happy ; our nature is to be peac@@ eful , our nature is to <T_8> healthy .
<T_0> could do the <T_1> with a space <T_2> .
<T_4> , one <T_6> , she &apos;d heard <T_0> the safe house , <T_9> left <T_2> father &apos;s house and <T_7> walked <T_1> two <T_3> , two <T_5> through ma@@ sa@@ i <T_8> .
it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er for that person to don@@ ate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger char@@ ity , <T_6> 50,000 dollars on their <T_5> , so still be rough@@ ly 2@@ 7@@ 0,000 dollars a <T_7> ahead of the game , now be called a <T_1> because <T_4> don@@ ated 100,000 dollars <T_0> char@@ ity , probably sit on <T_3> board of the hunger char@@ ity , indeed , probably super@@ vis@@ e the poor <T_2> who decided to become the <T_9> of the hunger char@@ ity , and have a life@@ time of this kind of power and influ@@ ence and popular <T_8> still ahead of them .
<T_5> in <T_0> future , as <T_3> go <T_1> , <T_4> will , of course , experience terrible <T_2> .
<T_0> was <T_1> failure .
&quot; &#91; <T_1> arab@@ ic &#93; -- <T_0> ! &quot;
<T_2> the <T_3> ways that <T_1> can <T_6> cy@@ ma@@ tics , we <T_5> actually start to <T_4> the <T_0> of things <T_7> seen .
<T_6> down , get <T_1> together <T_5> come back <T_7> talk <T_0> me when <T_4> can talk to me like <T_3> -- &quot; <T_2> ?
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> the air .
so <T_3> tend to expect <T_2> future to be worse <T_0> it ends up <T_1> .

so if <T_2> take some <T_1> and set them <T_0> motion with biological motion , your brain &apos;s circu@@ it@@ ry would understand <T_3> what &apos;s going on .
<T_1> : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and <T_8> for me to be here at ted@@ women is <T_6> , well , i think it was su@@ mm@@ ed up best last <T_2> at dinner when <T_5> said , &quot; <T_0> to the man at your table and <T_4> them , &apos; when the revolution starts , <T_7> &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for <T_9> very long time , starting with ra@@ ch@@ el car@@ son &apos;s &quot; sil@@ ent spring &quot; to the@@ o col@@ born &apos;s &quot; our stolen <T_3> &quot; to sand@@ ra stein@@ gr@@ aber &apos;s books &quot; living down@@ stream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot;

<T_1> would <T_0> it .
and <T_6> most <T_1> , it <T_2> begin <T_7> , but <T_3> it co@@ evol@@ ves and <T_0> , <T_8> we end up with a <T_4> relationship with <T_5> new par@@ asi@@ te .

<T_2> you &apos;re <T_0> thinking <T_4> your <T_1> would think of <T_3> that .

<T_2> i was <T_7> the united <T_0> , <T_4> thought the word <T_8> was a little <T_1> mean for <T_9> , <T_3> they <T_5> to call it <T_6> instead .
as a <T_0> , <T_7> comp@@ li@@ cations are <T_1> lower <T_3> what has been repor@@ ted in the <T_2> , and you don <T_5> see those kind of numbers <T_6> often <T_4>
now , you &apos;re not going to <T_0> a thing unless <T_1> h@@ its you .
now <T_2> &apos;m <T_0> actually sure that <T_3> did <T_1> that .
<T_3> , i <T_1> , <T_6> know , communic@@ ates to you <T_5> i did <T_0> think that <T_2> was <T_4> worth the price .
<T_0> first i <T_2> about this was when <T_3> coast <T_4> plane <T_1> up over@@ head .
today <T_0> face the <T_1> of <T_2> .
it had no <T_1> . <T_0> was <T_2> .
and when the vac@@ cine appeared <T_7> winter , there were <T_5> lot of people -- <T_4> surprising <T_9> -- who re@@ f@@ used to get <T_6> -- as a <T_1> example of how people &apos;s fe@@ el@@ ings of security change , how their <T_3> changes , sort of wil@@ dly with <T_8> new <T_0> , with no <T_2> in@@ put .
who <T_0> , <T_1> one <T_3> we &apos;ll even have <T_4> own <T_2> bond , right .
<T_3> is how they were advertising <T_2> a <T_0> ago on the <T_1> .
<T_1> she@@ pher@@ d : a <T_0> body <T_3> &apos;t a broken <T_2>
<T_0> we <T_4> about power transition , <T_1> often talk about <T_2> rise of <T_3> .
they &apos;re se@@ arch@@ ing for <T_1> meat ; forest animals <T_2> can kill <T_0> feed their <T_3> .
coral <T_2> a very <T_0> and <T_1> animal .
<T_2> last <T_3> , our population grew <T_0> 80 <T_1> .
now <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> right <T_1> to that ? &quot; <T_4> , <T_0> ! &quot;
<T_0> now , every <T_3> within five <T_1> is <T_5> by a <T_4> , <T_6> to collect its <T_2> .
<T_0> doesn &apos;t have to be in the <T_1> . &quot;
a third <T_1> was condu@@ cted with someone <T_0> the <T_2> .
<T_8> started <T_6> , making <T_3> , talking <T_5> exper@@ ts in the field , taking their feedback , <T_0> refin@@ ing , <T_2> i kept on refin@@ ing <T_7> refin@@ ing <T_9> ni@@ ghts <T_1> wee@@ ken@@ ds for over <T_4> years .
<T_2> is <T_1> that made it <T_0> way .
but just <T_1> to <T_0> web , <T_4> , pull <T_2> down , &quot; <T_3> t-@@ shir@@ t . &quot;
<T_0> made it to the top <T_1> a <T_2> pa@@ ir@@ ing <T_4> hollywood <T_3> science .
so <T_0> about <T_1> .
they &apos;re wearing <T_1> a yellow shir@@ t or a <T_0> shir@@ t .
and <T_3> teachers , after <T_1> get all the <T_2> , <T_4> like to give them <T_0> corre@@ ct <T_5> .
<T_0> , we &apos;re going <T_2> start <T_1> verse again .
<T_4> it <T_5> a <T_2> comp@@ ani@@ on that goes around it , so <T_1> big <T_6> , a <T_3> ball of <T_0> .
<T_0> is <T_2> , <T_1> difficult .
so <T_7> we were <T_8> , <T_6> best friend next to <T_4> says , &quot; man , why doesn &apos;t <T_2> inv@@ ent <T_1> that <T_5> can just put on <T_3> skin and then <T_0> don &apos;t have to <T_9> ? &quot;
<T_1> maybe <T_2> &apos;s some <T_0> evidence .
<T_1> &apos;ve done a <T_4> of ou@@ tra@@ geous things <T_2> our lives , <T_7> we <T_0> , <T_6> , <T_5> , <T_3> does &quot; local &quot; mean ?
<T_0> , <T_1> , <T_2> services , finally , clean <T_3> .
wouldn &apos;t it <T_2> great <T_0> our <T_1> could re@@ generate ?
<T_0> maybe <T_1> people .
and so you <T_4> start reading on <T_0> i@@ pa@@ d <T_1> your living room <T_2> then pick up where <T_5> left off <T_3> the <T_6> .
and <T_8> we <T_7> , <T_6> ideas with each other , there are <T_2> people min@@ ing <T_1> in order <T_4> power the <T_5> , extra@@ cting the <T_0> to make <T_3> of those things <T_9>
so , we <T_2> our <T_1> and y@@ am@@ un@@ a <T_0> project .
so <T_5> ex@@ changed business <T_7> , <T_6> we kept <T_3> each other and <T_2> to start <T_1> organization , <T_0> of the high <T_4> .
<T_1> the ri@@ bo@@ some here <T_0> another little <T_2> that hel@@ ps <T_3> the <T_4> of the <T_5> .
<T_1> would <T_0> very <T_2> during these disc@@ us@@ sions .
<T_2> , you te@@ ar up <T_3> &quot; <T_0> comm@@ and@@ ment &quot; -- <T_1> so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty .
now , the <T_4> of studying our <T_3> galaxy <T_0> it &apos;s <T_6> the closest example of the center of a galaxy that <T_5> &apos;re ever going to have , because <T_2> next closest galaxy <T_1> 100 <T_8> further <T_7> .
so the very <T_0> pur@@ ch@@ ase , <T_4> tar@@ ge@@ ted toward <T_2> or tar@@ ge@@ ted <T_3> somebody <T_1> .
<T_3> can use it to <T_4> each <T_0> up , <T_2> we &apos;re going to <T_1> that .
<T_1> rele@@ as@@ ing <T_2> caused wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad <T_0> .
ue : thank you very much .
we <T_3> and do more and <T_2> with less <T_1> less <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> those things , and <T_3> those <T_0> you have .
i <T_2> that <T_0> dep@@ th of <T_3> was 18 in@@ ches <T_1> less .
it <T_0> all foreign media <T_1> image production <T_4> of china <T_2> foreign media working <T_3> china .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> of those things .
and <T_0> i tell people about <T_2> , <T_7> tend to <T_8> of maybe an <T_5> or <T_6> year-old person who <T_1> really good <T_4> being <T_3> or <T_9> .
when <T_3> &apos;re at our <T_6> , we <T_7> out to <T_4> who are not like <T_1> , <T_5> when we do that , we <T_2> from people <T_0> are not like us .
<T_2> actually taking <T_0> opportunity that new technologies , <T_7> interactive technologies , present to re-@@ scri@@ pt our <T_6> , to <T_1> them , <T_5> just as <T_9> , individu@@ ated interactions , but <T_3> collective ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating actions that can amount to something , we can really begin to address some of <T_8> important <T_4> challenges .
and i <T_1> in a dark place for <T_2> long <T_0> , un@@ able to create .
<T_3> used <T_6> think <T_5> reason and <T_4> and <T_0> drive were the <T_1> ways to make things <T_2> .
what <T_0> see over here , this <T_1> the beautiful <T_3> v@@ u@@ it@@ ton <T_2> tro@@ ph@@ y .
and <T_5> great <T_0> of chicken mc@@ nug@@ gets was not <T_2> them , because <T_9> &apos;s kind of an <T_7> concept , but the trick behind chicken <T_1> was , <T_4> were able to re@@ move <T_6> chicken from the <T_8> in a co@@ st-@@ effective man@@ ner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy <T_3> .
<T_1> . <T_2> are <T_0> structures that we <T_3> here , the <T_4> .
it <T_1> to work with 3,000 <T_2> spli@@ t <T_3> three co@@ hor@@ ts <T_0> 1,000 <T_4> .
<T_3> we have <T_2> kind of -- as <T_4> , <T_0> have <T_1> of a &quot; <T_5> ! &quot; moment .
and <T_1> of those dots <T_4> the <T_0> in the <T_3> pan@@ els . <T_2> ?
it was <T_3> met@@ cal@@ fe invent@@ ing <T_0> e@@ ther@@ net <T_4> the <T_5> of all these <T_1> that <T_2> changed everything .
so <T_2> built <T_3> the <T_0> bar@@ e@@ foot training center <T_1> sierra <T_4> .
<T_0> would say , at least do <T_1> -- <T_5> years <T_4> enough <T_2> follow the <T_3> .
<T_0> clouds <T_6> grow so <T_5> , up to <T_1> wide and reach <T_3> to <T_2> feet into the atmosphere <T_4>
if that <T_0> &apos;s going down to <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;ll <T_3> .
<T_2> from <T_0> distance it appears that <T_1> &apos;s a single <T_3> .
and <T_2> we got <T_1> , its signific@@ ance <T_0> appar@@ ent .
either <T_1> &apos;re the <T_2> , or <T_6> one &apos;s <T_0> than this <T_4> , or this <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> than that one .
<T_1> believed that <T_4> they could figure out <T_2> flying <T_5> , <T_6> &apos;ll <T_3> the <T_0> of the world .
<T_2> last is that we &apos;re <T_3> connected now to <T_6> people on the <T_0> than <T_4> before -- <T_1> for if you &apos;re <T_5> next to someone .
what <T_0> the <T_3> of <T_1> sustainable , car@@ bon@@ -@@ free <T_2> ?
<T_3> want to have a hand@@ out that gives a <T_1> more <T_5> , <T_4> the <T_2> has to stand <T_0> you over here .
<T_2> i <T_0> to walk through <T_1> like this .
<T_2> , <T_1> just said <T_0> surge@@ ons .
&quot; he <T_1> out , he saw <T_0> , &quot; right ?
<T_4> think <T_1> &apos;re now at <T_2> percent <T_3> when it comes <T_0> dr@@ one <T_5> .
well , the <T_0> is literally a ke@@ y@@ stone <T_2> in these <T_1> .
<T_5> ward : <T_4> , every <T_0> cell in <T_1> can produce minute <T_3> of hydro@@ gen sul@@ fi@@ de <T_2> great cris@@ es .
this <T_7> a $ 1 web ser@@ ver , and <T_1> possibility of making <T_9> web ser@@ ver <T_0> a <T_3> grew into what became known <T_4> the internet of <T_6> , which is literally an industry <T_2> with tremendous impli@@ cations for <T_8> care , <T_5> efficiency .
a <T_3> it &apos;s because the <T_2> who asked the question <T_0> to make <T_1> app also .
and <T_2> their <T_4> appe@@ ar@@ ance , tasman@@ ian <T_0> are actually <T_3> ad@@ or@@ able little <T_1> .
and just <T_7> kind of put us in <T_8> , <T_6> is <T_2> picture <T_3> saturn taken <T_4> a space@@ craft from <T_5> saturn , looking <T_1> the <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s it <T_0> now .
<T_7> , <T_8> in <T_5> united <T_1> , <T_4> you meet someone at the <T_3> of society , they <T_2> un@@ kin@@ dly be <T_6> as a &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
and we found <T_1> this whole process , we found this great little <T_4> in <T_0> , and if <T_7> body language is any <T_2> , <T_6> &apos;s <T_8> ow@@ ner — — of <T_9> it &apos;s like for <T_5> manufactur@@ er to work directly <T_3> a designer , you &apos;ve got to see what happens here .
<T_1> , they started <T_0> .
<T_2> changes about <T_4> third of <T_3> way into the 20th century , <T_1> this became <T_5> of the primary ven@@ ues <T_0> music .
or <T_0> it &apos;s chemicals .
and <T_3> that moment , the dog trans@@ formed <T_2> the <T_4> of <T_1> and <T_0> .
i <T_2> that i &apos;m not my <T_1> , <T_0> i <T_5> know <T_4> you &apos;re not <T_3> .
<T_8> would always stop by to visit <T_9> huge win@@ ged bu@@ ll@@ s that used <T_0> gu@@ ard the <T_1> of that ancient <T_7> , and <T_2> boy used <T_3> be sc@@ ared <T_6> these win@@ ged <T_4> , but at the same time they excited <T_5> .
<T_2> their <T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_1> needs <T_0> and years .
<T_5> were <T_8> to safety . they were re@@ classi@@ fied <T_7> y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ v <T_9> and they <T_0> to stay <T_2> step <T_6> of their <T_3> for the <T_1> of the war , survi@@ ving <T_4> and bom@@ b@@ ings and , at the end of the war , ar@@ rest by the so@@ vie@@ ts .
and that is , to no surprise , in shakespe@@ are , and in his play , ham@@ let .

so clu@@ sters of galaxies will tend to form , <T_1> of all this <T_0> attra@@ ction .
<T_3> get their <T_1> , their <T_5> , their <T_4> know@@ -@@ how , from <T_2> emerging econom@@ ies <T_0> the south .
he <T_1> me to go <T_2> his <T_0> .
<T_2> are <T_1> setting up our schools this way <T_0> our work@@ places ?
all the <T_3> that the <T_0> had repres@@ sed <T_2> re@@ moved will go <T_4> , <T_1> they &apos;ll take with them <T_5> go@@ ds .
<T_9> world &apos;s ambi@@ tious <T_5> and influ@@ en@@ cers now <T_3> get their <T_8> to <T_1> far and <T_7> , and <T_4> the <T_2> of the spo@@ ken word pretty much <T_0> on the <T_6> .
great <T_0> . it <T_5> me <T_1> that most <T_3> don &apos;t seem <T_2> know this <T_4> .
<T_1> didn &apos;t <T_2> go to <T_0> school .
<T_0> could <T_2> practice such a <T_1> ?
once i prime <T_1> brain -- it &apos;s called <T_7> pri@@ ming -- <T_5> i prime <T_3> brain to <T_9> it , <T_6> po@@ ps <T_4> out again <T_0> without the <T_8> that <T_2> &apos;ve im@@ posed on it .
<T_1> businesses now , fortunately , have co@@ des of condu@@ ct and au@@ dit <T_3> supply <T_4> , <T_0> not every <T_2> . far <T_5> it .
she ris@@ ks <T_0> lot <T_1> she &apos;s <T_2> .
but <T_1> knew what <T_9> meant , <T_3> it would <T_7> possible to take <T_8> bunch of <T_0> of <T_6> in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system such that it <T_5> appear that there was a real <T_2> when <T_4> wasn &apos;t .
<T_4> think <T_0> is <T_2> very pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly right <T_1> what <T_3> women are doing .
the <T_2> is , after all , a <T_1> co@@ oper@@ ative <T_0> .
any <T_0> ?
<T_2> had to get on the <T_0> . this <T_1> was always on the phone .
you <T_0> see , even <T_1> you <T_3> &apos;t go for the <T_2> , the <T_5> of the <T_4> .
does <T_0> remember that ? &quot;
<T_3> and music are normally given a higher <T_1> in schools than dra@@ ma <T_5> dance . <T_7> isn &apos;t an <T_9> system on <T_2> planet that tea@@ ches dance <T_8> to children <T_4> way we <T_6> them mathematics . <T_0> ?
<T_1> i figured <T_2> i made <T_4> funny , <T_3> wouldn &apos;t be as <T_0> .
there <T_2> very , very <T_0> people <T_1> don &apos;t <T_3> now about what is happening <T_4> the <T_5> .
and <T_3> it was simply <T_1> to me to find <T_0> organization that actually appreci@@ ated <T_2> those si@@ des .
this <T_0> it <T_2> for <T_4> farmers to even harv@@ est the <T_1> from <T_3> fields .
<T_5> biggest <T_2> are ger@@ man , japanese , <T_3> -- <T_4> the western european <T_1> are quite <T_0> .
so <T_3> : look , <T_2> &apos;re all going to get <T_0> , and we &apos;re all going to get <T_1> .
some <T_8> , <T_4> give people on the <T_2> some money <T_9> themselves and <T_6> , &quot; spend <T_0> however you want on <T_5> , &quot; just <T_1> we did <T_3> the under@@ gra@@ ds in <T_7> .
you <T_2> , i was <T_1> about freu@@ di@@ an <T_0> .
thank you .
and <T_4> is what this <T_1> is , <T_0> dec@@ lar@@ ation made by <T_7> rul@@ er <T_8> by god who <T_5> top@@ pl@@ ed <T_6> ira@@ q@@ i des@@ po@@ t and was <T_3> to bring <T_2> to the people .
so i always <T_0> to <T_3> the story , like , one hand <T_1> is that , the other <T_2> is that .
<T_0> that is &quot; <T_2> &apos;t <T_1> twice , it &apos;s all <T_3> . &quot;
<T_3> first , i need <T_7> talk to <T_8> about a <T_4> , which is <T_1> story , <T_0> the <T_5> of this <T_2> that you &apos;re all here <T_6> today .
it &apos;s a <T_2> trying to <T_3> with <T_0> bron@@ ze <T_4> of a <T_1> .
in this <T_2> i &apos;ll <T_1> show you a <T_0> .
there &apos;s what we call <T_0> activ@@ ation .
so you <T_3> , <T_5> is not about doing <T_2> , this <T_4> about <T_1> growth <T_0> global emplo@@ y@@ ment .
he also <T_1> to me that <T_6> had a <T_2> , too , and <T_0> first time i saw them i <T_5> have been <T_7> or four , and <T_4> were <T_3> years <T_8> than <T_9> .
<T_1> the brand stand <T_0> in your head ?
and <T_7> all around the world have <T_8> of different meas@@ ures : den@@ se cities <T_4> dis@@ per@@ sed cities , lots of roads or <T_6> of public <T_1> or lots of bi@@ ke lan@@ es <T_9> <T_2> , or <T_0> of different things , but nothing <T_3> to <T_5> .
and also , as a child , i was <T_1> fat@@ test kid <T_5> class , so <T_4> used to love <T_0> . <T_7> , <T_3> love <T_6> , <T_2> .
<T_6> it &apos;s an in@@ her@@ ent <T_0> of <T_4> energy policy , which <T_3> we don &apos;t talk about <T_5> the <T_2> of <T_1> that <T_7> use .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> likely too <T_1> gl@@ u@@ co@@ se : <T_3> .
the classic <T_3> is , you get a <T_6> of studies where <T_1> know <T_8> they &apos;ve been condu@@ cted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in <T_4> acade@@ mic <T_0> . so <T_5> took all of the tri@@ als that had ever been condu@@ cted on <T_2> that were <T_9> over a 15@@ -@@ year <T_7> by the f@@ da .
<T_4> then <T_2> &apos;s mon@@ arch@@ y <T_3> that &apos;s my <T_0> on the <T_1> , so ...
<T_3> the <T_0> news <T_1> they are <T_2> there .
<T_0> his gir@@ l@@ friend is <T_2> not very <T_1> about <T_3> either .
and <T_2> is full <T_0> -- it &apos;s <T_1> tiny <T_3> .
<T_9> san@@ tos <T_2> for the <T_7> of human <T_6> by watching <T_8> way <T_3> pri@@ mate rela@@ tives make decisions . a clever series of experiments in &quot; <T_4> &quot; <T_0> that some of <T_1> sil@@ ly choices <T_5> make , mon@@ keys make too .
<T_4> i &apos;m <T_8> that <T_1> , because a lot of the time i &apos;ve been <T_7> , many times i &apos;ve been asked , &quot; yeah , but , this is really nai@@ ve , <T_3> flo@@ wers over , i mean — &quot; i was <T_9> the <T_5> . i <T_6> in the par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers for three years , and <T_2> know how it <T_0> from the ground .
but my <T_5> was <T_3> by so@@ le@@ m@@ n and mor@@ bi@@ d <T_9> -- thou@@ ghts <T_8> <T_1> through the <T_7> &apos;s high-@@ security death row , as this <T_6> the only <T_4> to take <T_2> to the <T_0> oper@@ ating room .
in <T_8> , <T_2> a good <T_1> , we might have <T_5> or <T_7> human beings at <T_4> average dep@@ th of <T_3> earth -- maybe <T_0> or five human <T_6> out of whatever billions we &apos;ve got going .
now , the world <T_1> opportunities <T_3> new <T_2> and new <T_0> .
the <T_3> thing is : <T_4> about the <T_0> ? <T_2> men@@ tioned <T_1> footprint .
but lots of <T_1> now live <T_3> 90 or <T_6> , unless <T_2> shake hands <T_4> much <T_5> something <T_0> that .
it <T_6> time <T_4> us <T_8> a@@ im <T_3> when it comes <T_7> women , to inv@@ est <T_0> and to de@@ plo@@ y <T_1> dollars <T_5> benef@@ it women all around the <T_2> .
now , <T_5> can &apos;t actually take a <T_8> of this process , <T_0> sha@@ wn <T_3> at harvard <T_4> made a nice visu@@ alization for us <T_9> begins <T_6> a <T_7> strand and has <T_2> short <T_1> in it .
but there was <T_1> third <T_3> that <T_2> got by doing this move that <T_0> unexpected .
<T_3> &apos;d <T_0> like to point out that <T_2> doesn &apos;t o@@ be@@ y <T_1> .
the <T_0> was never <T_2> there was <T_1> day of global c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire and <T_3> .
we <T_0> no <T_1> in <T_2> country . i &apos;m <T_3> .
so the er@@ a <T_1> big <T_2> is <T_0> .

why not <T_1> all of the states to do <T_0> instead ?
<T_1> , i &apos;m sorry . what was <T_0> on ?
<T_0> also exists in more <T_1> game forms .
<T_3> wanted to see if this <T_5> true <T_0> in <T_2> world or <T_4> among <T_1> countries .
and <T_4> that <T_3> people <T_1> teach you <T_0> them and celebrate <T_2> too .
<T_2> , it &apos;s -- how <T_1> you , what <T_0> ?
there &apos;s nobody <T_6> &apos;ll <T_7> in <T_0> life <T_5> ever live beyond 200 <T_4> , so we thought that &apos;s a <T_3> place where we should situ@@ ate <T_1> plan and let <T_2> imagination take flight .
because obviously , if <T_6> in the <T_3> were such a <T_2> , <T_1> job , <T_0> in the world would <T_5> guys <T_7> at <T_4> &apos;s ?
now , we have <T_1> ways <T_2> study <T_0> vari@@ ability .
this <T_3> has been formed in <T_1> last <T_4> of years because of the <T_0> of the <T_2> .
you <T_3> &apos;t <T_8> -- well , you <T_6> &apos;t <T_7> it at all -- <T_4> the <T_1> line <T_0> really the more <T_2> of pa@@ yo@@ ff , in <T_5> sense .

<T_6> , am <T_1> saying <T_0> in <T_5> department <T_2> motor vehi@@ cles across the land , you find <T_4> stage <T_3> culture ?
<T_6> one of the <T_5> it is so <T_4> is that , <T_0> ali@@ ens and <T_2> , we look at human <T_1> every <T_3> .
and <T_2> happens <T_1> in the <T_0> .
why <T_0> ?
h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic <T_2> , <T_3> out of three <T_0> the marsh@@ mal@@ low ; <T_1> out of <T_4> did <T_5> .
i would <T_7> to talk today <T_1> what i think is one of the <T_0> adv@@ ent@@ ures human <T_3> have em@@ bar@@ ked upon , which is the <T_2> to <T_8> the <T_4> and <T_6> place <T_5> .
and <T_4> four <T_1> , <T_0> swit@@ ches , and <T_3> a circu@@ it break@@ er , mod@@ el@@ ed after <T_5> electric <T_2> .
the <T_2> of the <T_0> also comes <T_4> ; <T_3> provi@@ des a <T_1> of company .
<T_1> , i think <T_0> should look <T_2> little bit larger .
<T_0> you very much <T_1> .
<T_4> have <T_3> molecular comp@@ il@@ er , you <T_1> do <T_2> you <T_0> .
so , what i &apos;m <T_8> to <T_9> you today , is a little bit of why <T_1> think that &apos;s <T_5> case , and <T_2> go out of my comfort zone <T_3> tell you <T_4> i think it &apos;s going , where <T_7> new approach -- that we hope to push <T_0> in terms of <T_6> cancer .
we &apos;re <T_1> the <T_4> of the <T_2> and the <T_3> of the <T_0> .
and <T_0> &apos;s called <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> little <T_5> of <T_3> going up now , when you were <T_0> your <T_4> .
and so i <T_4> ja@@ wa@@ d , &quot; <T_0> do <T_1> guys na@@ vig@@ ate ? <T_5> is <T_3> really <T_2> community .
if <T_3> take a look <T_8> these <T_9> that we have of <T_2> , <T_5> can see <T_4> the human face does <T_0> enormous <T_1> of amazing things as <T_6> goes into different <T_7> .
<T_2> this , this is <T_0> im@@ plan@@ table <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s what <T_4> friend <T_5> said : wake up <T_3> take <T_0> of your <T_1> .
<T_4> , <T_0> you get <T_6> else out of <T_3> talk , practice <T_5> listening , <T_2> you can transform your <T_1> .
<T_4> is <T_0> slightly <T_2> angle , <T_1> again a <T_3> motion version of this .

<T_1> now <T_2> card with a <T_0> of five of clu@@ bs .
let <T_2> show <T_1> that idea <T_0> .
i &apos;d -- there &apos;s <T_0> story <T_2> &apos;d just like to <T_1> .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_5> electrical <T_3> that are holding <T_1> the <T_4> about whatever <T_0> it .
and this is an <T_7> from my first edi@@ tor &apos;s le@@ tter , <T_8> i say that ro@@ okie , we don &apos;t have all the <T_2> , we &apos;re still fig@@ uring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission <T_1> find the answers themselves , but hopefully <T_6> them to <T_9> that <T_0> can give themselves that <T_5> , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , <T_4> of that , and ro@@ okie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be <T_3> out .
and <T_0> learned <T_1> from <T_3> guy , who is <T_4> amazing <T_2> .
you <T_0> to where you started .
we <T_5> stories <T_3> &quot; <T_0> se@@ ven@@ -@@ leagu@@ e boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put <T_8> on , with every <T_9> you could cover <T_1> leagu@@ es , or <T_2> miles , a <T_7> of <T_6> completely uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to people without <T_4> kind of energy at their dis@@ pos@@ al .

so , instead of having a situation where only the police have the information <T_3> which cri@@ mes are com@@ mitted <T_0> , <T_1> we have to emplo@@ y <T_7> in government to try and hold the police <T_4> account , suddenly , we &apos;ve got this vast opportunity for people power , where we , as citizens , can see <T_6> cri@@ mes are being <T_9> -- where , when and by wh@@ om -- and we <T_2> hold the <T_8> to <T_5> .
and if i go down and look at <T_6> , <T_3> there was such a <T_5> fam@@ ine , la@@ stly , it &apos;s like <T_9> . <T_1> 20 percent po@@ or@@ est <T_8> ni@@ ger is out here , and the <T_4> percent rich@@ est of south africa <T_0> there , and <T_2> we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in <T_7> .
so <T_1> , <T_4> , d is the <T_3> as f , <T_0> , <T_2> .
<T_3> came <T_1> apply for the <T_2> , and she did <T_0> meet any <T_4> that we had .
so , what <T_1> the <T_0> of that ?
and in <T_0> , he had <T_1> ideas to <T_2> them go away .
but , once <T_0> started to <T_2> , then <T_1> got behind <T_3> again .
and then <T_3> i got <T_4> , i sat down and i set <T_0> to <T_2> to really try <T_5> create <T_1> just completely outside of the box .
so <T_0> are the <T_3> that my <T_1> and i <T_2> d-@@ re@@ v ask ourselves .
<T_3> here &apos;s the <T_1> factor , <T_0> is totally <T_2> .

the <T_5> of <T_1> is <T_2> going to come as no <T_3> to <T_0> parents in the <T_4> .
<T_4> &apos;s e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally <T_1> ; <T_2> stop@@ s <T_3> population explosion <T_0> fo@@ xes . &quot;
<T_3> we &apos;re working in <T_5> area <T_2> sou@@ thern ka@@ yon@@ za , <T_6> is one of <T_0> po@@ or@@ est <T_1> in r@@ wand@@ a , <T_4> a group that origin@@ ally inclu@@ des about 40@@ 0,000 <T_7> .
<T_3> -- where do <T_1> go putting all of <T_0> dis@@ par@@ ate <T_2> together ?
<T_7> &apos;s <T_1> difficult <T_5> me <T_3> get fi@@ j@@ ian news , which <T_0> strange , <T_4> actually there &apos;s an <T_6> amount going on <T_2> fi@@ j@@ i .
i &apos;m doing it so we <T_0> identify what <T_1> &apos;re up against .
the <T_9> of what <T_5> said was <T_1> : the <T_4> most <T_7> by the <T_0> and <T_2> of life do not want <T_8> theor@@ ies <T_3> how god let this <T_6> .

anth@@ ony <T_0> : printing a <T_1> ki@@ dney
and <T_1> is <T_3> son <T_0> with me <T_2> a <T_4> fa@@ st-@@ food thing .
but <T_0> a@@ in &apos;t going to pay <T_1> what others , who <T_2> more <T_6> , have <T_4> created , and <T_5> can agree on <T_3> .
this <T_5> the <T_2> one , <T_4> one that isn &apos;t <T_3> . that &apos;s why <T_0> leave <T_6> to <T_1> end .
i <T_2> measure my <T_0> , my cal@@ or@@ ic <T_1> .
and so , if you &apos;ll put up with <T_7> , <T_8> would like to en@@ list your help with a <T_6> experiment <T_1> . the experiment <T_0> -- and i notice , by the way , that when you appl@@ au@@ ded , <T_4> you did it <T_5> a typical <T_9> american way , that is , you <T_3> rau@@ c@@ ous <T_2> in@@ co@@ her@@ ent .
and <T_3> we <T_7> that , <T_1> number of <T_4> cases in the world dro@@ pped to <T_0> , and in <T_2> we dec@@ lar@@ ed the <T_5> free of <T_6> .
there <T_2> a period <T_1> which <T_4> talked about an <T_0> of creation , <T_6> these <T_3> were so <T_5> .
and if <T_9> were to <T_3> a volu@@ me , it <T_4> be called , &quot; <T_2> who have led <T_7> exhibi@@ tions &quot; because my work , in understanding art and in <T_5> culture , has come <T_0> follo@@ wing artists , by <T_1> at what <T_8> mean <T_6> what they do and who they are .
<T_0> : <T_2> more , <T_1> more .
in 1993 <T_2> dec@@ lar@@ ed the <T_1> of the <T_0> struggle .
<T_0> has given ey@@ es@@ ight to two <T_2> people for <T_1> .
now this <T_5> my new <T_4> identity , <T_6> the first thing i did <T_0> a s@@ layer was call <T_9> twin sister -- i have an identical twin <T_7> named kel@@ ly -- <T_2> tell her , i &apos;m <T_1> a game <T_3> he@@ al my brain , and i want you to <T_8> with me .
and <T_1> can <T_0> walk .
<T_9> he <T_3> his a@@ ward , he <T_8> these lo@@ vely <T_7> : &quot; <T_6> children <T_4> lead africa from <T_1> it is <T_0> , a dark <T_2> , to <T_5> light continent . &quot;
<T_0> is what goes on <T_4> my <T_2> everyday . <T_5> walk -- i &apos;m <T_1> . <T_6> come <T_3> .
and here &apos;s <T_1> little <T_0> of that .
<T_2> the end <T_3> is global <T_1> , they &apos;re doing <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s a mista@@ ke that <T_2> literally <T_1> us <T_3> future .
<T_1> begins <T_4> expla@@ ining <T_8> science works through <T_2> testing of <T_7> that are <T_6> to be vulnerable <T_3> dis@@ proof , and then <T_0> goes <T_5> .
<T_3> gets dr@@ unk , <T_4> &apos;t use <T_2> . <T_0> back , <T_1> again . &quot;
and so <T_0> ment@@ or <T_1> went along with .
they lack nutri@@ ents , and <T_0> de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates <T_1> .
now , what <T_4> were care@@ ful <T_3> do was , vitamin <T_6> is made <T_8> ultravio@@ let b rays <T_5> we <T_0> to separate our <T_1> from the <T_2> d <T_7> .
well within a <T_0> days i &apos;m able to do <T_1> cros@@ sing .
now , there was a <T_2> effort <T_5> solve <T_0> problem , <T_1> there <T_4> actually a big <T_3> .
<T_2> can be <T_0> the sou@@ th@@ west <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s not <T_4> a question <T_2> cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess ; <T_7> &apos;s also a <T_5> of how <T_0> organisms then turn <T_6> human <T_3> .
<T_4> , for <T_1> , wol@@ fra@@ m alpha <T_2> mathema@@ tica <T_7> actually now <T_3> of algorithms <T_0> we discovered by se@@ arch@@ ing <T_5> compu@@ ta@@ tional <T_6> .
same thing in the clin@@ ic <T_0> .
that &apos;s what <T_0> really want to <T_1> on .
we got <T_2> to do the <T_1> thing <T_5> new <T_3> , and in <T_4> , and in <T_0> angeles .
this slide was <T_3> before . <T_2> is the <T_0> j@@ ur@@ assi@@ c bird <T_1> .
so , what i &apos;d like to <T_5> you <T_0> what <T_3> would take to <T_2> 75 pounds of <T_1> en@@ rich@@ ed <T_4> .
it &apos;s a <T_2> different than the way <T_3> think about brain dis@@ or@@ ders <T_5> hun@@ t@@ ington &apos;s or <T_7> &apos;s or <T_4> &apos;s <T_6> where you have <T_0> bom@@ bed@@ -@@ out part of <T_1> cortex .
you see , a lot of the <T_5> that <T_0> most <T_4> , they &apos;re <T_2> artists , <T_3> designers , <T_1> thin@@ kers , they &apos;re le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand@@ ed .
in <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;s a phone number and <T_3> address in <T_1> .
but <T_3> is the material that <T_0> love the most , and i &apos;m going to tell you the <T_2> about <T_1> .
thank you very much .
<T_6> &apos;s a <T_3> looking at <T_0> genetic <T_4> of flu <T_5> compar@@ ing that <T_1> hiv , a much wil@@ der <T_2> .

and that &apos;s <T_0> to <T_1> an enormous <T_2> .

<T_1> if you look <T_0> the little <T_2> here , the <T_4> is always going to be <T_3> .
<T_3> , suddenly , <T_0> thought occur@@ red that kind of put a ble@@ mis@@ h on <T_2> amazing <T_1> here .

<T_2> love <T_0> appar@@ ent truth of <T_1> .
<T_6> first thing is , we &apos;re very <T_0> that technology <T_1> at a point where <T_3> is much <T_4> advan@@ ced than when <T_5> countries had <T_2> development .
you should <T_2> nu@@ dge them in <T_0> right <T_1> .
<T_5> a few <T_1> , <T_3> five and seven <T_7> , fish come <T_2> , they <T_6> the <T_8> , and <T_0> the al@@ ga@@ e grow <T_4> .
<T_2> the ni@@ geri@@ an <T_0> chin@@ u@@ a <T_1> calls &quot; a <T_4> of <T_3> . &quot;
so we saw <T_0> prote@@ stant re@@ formation .
so <T_0> wil@@ der@@ ness , no <T_1> .
<T_0> wish that <T_2> ab@@ use <T_1> explo@@ itation <T_4> schools would <T_3> . &quot;
<T_2> do <T_0> follow instru@@ ctions . and <T_1> on .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> computer where <T_0> people are the <T_3> .
<T_5> have <T_0> idea <T_3> someone &apos;s going to c@@ ough into a <T_2> , and <T_1> &apos;s probably really <T_6> , <T_4> ?
<T_0> the good <T_2> , <T_3> one &apos;s a <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;re not ideas , <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> .
so <T_2> i &apos;m going <T_0> get to my ted <T_1> .
i worked in the <T_3> . <T_9> found <T_2> sustainable <T_8> to <T_1> every <T_5> school <T_6> the area , from the <T_0> , onto the fres@@ h <T_7> : six-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half gr@@ and per <T_4> .
<T_1> just know that <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> front <T_3> this war .

so , we &apos;re going to <T_0> off looking at the <T_7> ball -- and <T_2> &apos;m <T_1> to tell you <T_9> color , and <T_6> &apos;m also going to <T_4> you to go <T_8> your <T_5> . <T_3> ?
<T_2> great <T_1> would have &quot; head &quot; : it would <T_3> interesting <T_4> ideas and <T_0> .

a 4@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> a sin . &quot;
<T_2> we <T_3> , however , are <T_0> over@@ la@@ pping <T_1> .
<T_1> mountains are <T_6> places , but <T_5> the fa@@ te of these bear <T_3> , and <T_0> that of all be@@ ars <T_2> the <T_8> , <T_4> on the <T_7> .
that was &#91; un@@ clear &#93; also -- you know , because <T_3> were <T_0> about the risk of it , <T_2> it worked <T_1> well .
<T_0> i was in <T_2> school , i got <T_1> first phili@@ ps re@@ el@@ -@@ to-@@ re@@ el tape recor@@ der , and tape recor@@ ders <T_3> my sort of pre@@ -@@ computer medium <T_4> learning .
richard <T_1> was a <T_0> complex <T_2> .

<T_0> call <T_1> my z@@ .@@ e.@@ n@@ . clu@@ ster .

when we <T_1> in <T_2> school , we <T_5> our <T_0> from <T_4> such as <T_3> where everything &apos;s color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .

<T_3> see that south america and africa <T_1> be connected <T_9> a certain <T_6> , right ? other people say , &quot; oh , <T_8> sounds <T_5> . &quot; <T_7> &apos;s <T_0> . <T_2> , what <T_4> lan@@ ce ?
<T_1> &apos;t even <T_0> .
<T_8> right <T_7> the s@@ wa@@ p <T_0> five days <T_1> , <T_6> who are stuck with that <T_4> , who have <T_2> choice , who can <T_5> change <T_3> mind , like <T_9> a lot !
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> fundamental to <T_0> we are .
<T_2> big <T_1> that you <T_0> outside , that &apos;s <T_3> he@@ at shi@@ eld which is going to protect <T_4> .
<T_1> because <T_0> don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got <T_2> up the answer <T_3>
we &apos;ve only been around for the <T_2> 200@@ ,000 years <T_1> a species , <T_4> we &apos;ve <T_5> a <T_3> of more than six and a half <T_0> people .

<T_2> are not bor@@ ro@@ wing <T_0> from our <T_1> .
<T_3> jo@@ ined <T_1> when it had <T_2> numbers than <T_0> currently have <T_5> on <T_4> .
consider <T_0> 2008 terror@@ ist attack <T_1> mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i .
<T_6> i am re@@ minded that <T_0> the world <T_4> are cultures with vast sums of knowledge <T_8> them , as <T_7> as <T_3> mi@@ cr@@ on@@ es@@ ian na@@ vig@@ ators , that are going dis@@ mis@@ sed , that this is <T_1> te@@ stam@@ ent to brilliant , <T_2> technology and science and <T_9> that is van@@ ishing <T_5> .
it &apos;s a <T_2> we &apos;re <T_7> , the <T_3> x prize , <T_6> the <T_0> team to <T_8> 100 <T_1> genom@@ es <T_5> 10 <T_4> .
and of <T_4> , it made me <T_0> , <T_2> i wasn &apos;t able to have <T_1> child , <T_3> would that <T_8> for <T_6> marriage , and <T_5> me as a <T_7> .
<T_3> cannot be <T_1> because god <T_4> om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent , <T_5> -- too <T_0> above <T_2> .
and <T_6> one of our labs , jack s@@ zo@@ sta@@ k &apos;s <T_0> , <T_3> was a series of <T_5> in <T_9> last four years <T_1> showed that the <T_2> -- <T_4> are very common on planets , on <T_8> types of planets like <T_7> earth , where you have some li@@ qu@@ id water and some cla@@ ys -- you actually end up with natur@@ ally available molecules which spon@@ taneously form bub@@ bles .
and , of <T_9> importance <T_8> , we <T_5> ar@@ es in <T_7> earth &apos;s atmosphere , <T_1> 100,000 feet , which is <T_3> to the den@@ sity <T_2> pressure of <T_0> atmosphere on <T_4> where <T_6> &apos;ll fly .
so what <T_0> we make of <T_3> ? first of all , we <T_1> that you &apos;re <T_2> brilliant .
l@@ b : well , you know , <T_8> r@@ on st@@ . john -- <T_7> hope <T_3> &apos;ll go and meet him in the <T_5> afterwards and <T_1> to him -- <T_6> he started <T_0> -- in <T_9> , there was <T_2> out@@ break <T_4> bird flu .
in <T_6> , the <T_2> minister of finance said <T_0> me , <T_4> i asked <T_3> what are we <T_5> wrong in <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;re all <T_1> .
it &apos;s a global <T_1> . we <T_2> to get this <T_0> .
<T_0> you go on the <T_3> there , it looks <T_1> this , and <T_2> is the gran@@ da@@ d@@ dy <T_4> .
and it &apos;s this <T_2> balance that i think <T_6> we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground , that &apos;s trying to do something you &apos;ve never <T_3> before , that imag@@ in@@ ary <T_4> where you actually don &apos;t <T_7> where you &apos;re going to <T_0> up , that &apos;s the fine line on the <T_8> of a <T_5> that i have walked <T_9> whole <T_1> .

so , if <T_2> think of the transition <T_4> our <T_1> of the movement <T_8> the land <T_0> the <T_5> , <T_9> took 200 <T_3> , then <T_6> same process is happening in <T_7> years .

so <T_0> think , first and <T_3> , aids is <T_1> policy <T_2> .
i <T_7> the <T_8> map <T_1> i ren@@ am@@ ed all the <T_3> to abstra@@ ct musi@@ cal pro@@ vo@@ cations , and the <T_0> , <T_6> are synchr@@ oni@@ zed with stop@@ wat@@ ches , <T_4> the ti@@ met@@ ables , <T_2> are li@@ sted in <T_5> past the hour <T_9>
night <T_0> night , he took <T_1> up on <T_5> ter@@ race , <T_3> his shoul@@ ders , <T_2> poin@@ ted out <T_6> and <T_4> and <T_8> great <T_7> to me .
now this <T_9> doesn &apos;t start <T_7> vast <T_8> or <T_3> space@@ craft , but <T_4> rather more hum@@ ble technology -- and in <T_0> , the very medium <T_1> gave us the <T_2> revolution that we &apos;re <T_6> part of today : the <T_5> .
<T_3> &apos;d been <T_2> that these is@@ lands , <T_1> several others near@@ by , were popul@@ ated <T_0> can@@ ni@@ b@@ als .
<T_1> on <T_4> moun@@ tain <T_0> we gain that <T_3> peace of mind , what are <T_2> really achiev@@ ing ?
if you look <T_6> , you <T_9> even see <T_0> hin@@ t of <T_4> app@@ le <T_8> , up <T_1> in the upper <T_2> , <T_3> the virtual <T_7> has literally pun@@ ched through to the <T_5> .
so <T_3> &apos;ve shown <T_0> some of <T_1> first <T_2> of retro@@ f@@ its .
<T_1> seem@@ ed <T_0> intui@@ tive to me .
let me <T_1> you about <T_0> .
<T_0> we <T_1> it together ?
<T_2> we &apos;re doing this <T_0> the second <T_3> oil reser@@ ves on <T_1> planet .
<T_1> scienti@@ fically , they &apos;re amazing <T_0> they &apos;re <T_2> .
it <T_1> my <T_3> -- &quot; the in@@ convenient <T_2> &quot; and mr. <T_0> .
now , of course , we <T_3> normally <T_5> because the <T_2> has no gli@@ ding <T_4> , so <T_0> thought , &quot; oh that &apos;s <T_6> . we &apos;ll put it <T_7> a ver@@ tical wind <T_1> .
&quot; great -- got it . &quot;
<T_0> like <T_2> wasn &apos;t <T_1> and only <T_3> .
<T_6> i &apos;m <T_4> to leave you with one <T_0> demonstration , <T_7> before i <T_1> that , i would like to say <T_2> you , <T_3> think <T_5> .
i said , &quot; was <T_0> a <T_3> for <T_2> in <T_4> life that <T_1> were not <T_5> ? &quot;
now <T_1> again <T_0> this .
so <T_0> i shake <T_1> ket@@ ch@@ up <T_5> , <T_3> get some <T_4> sensory feedback <T_2> the function of time in the bottom row .
<T_5> : <T_4> you got this <T_7> out of the <T_6> -- <T_8> &apos;s really <T_9> , and it <T_1> a lot of convin@@ cing to get <T_3> as mo@@ dest as <T_2> to allow us to <T_0> lu@@ ke .
<T_1> technologies don &apos;t last and <T_3> , <T_0> will not <T_2> .
but <T_2> had <T_5> so afraid <T_1> conflict , until finally <T_0> became more afraid <T_4> the <T_3> .
<T_4> you need <T_1> , you <T_0> to be <T_3> on by a boar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied <T_2> .
millions <T_1> people have contribu@@ ted their des@@ k@@ top computers <T_6> they &apos;re not using them to link together <T_2> the <T_7> into super@@ computing <T_9> that help <T_4> the protein folding problem for medical <T_0> -- that &apos;s folding @ <T_5> at <T_8> -- to crack co@@ des , to search <T_3> life in ou@@ ter space .
so we can now <T_0> at <T_1> smar@@ t@@ bird .
a <T_2> approach <T_0> design , <T_5> &apos;m call@@ ing <T_4> bio@@ in@@ formed <T_3> , and i think <T_1> &apos;s possible .
so if <T_0> ask you to <T_5> a <T_3> , <T_2> , <T_1> is <T_4> ?
but for me , i <T_1> another <T_2> to be <T_3> in@@ cur@@ able <T_0> .
i had a <T_0> who came <T_1> who <T_5> , &quot; <T_2> dad says <T_3> &apos;re <T_4> de@@ vil . &quot;
so <T_3> &apos;s been <T_1> years since <T_0> got my own <T_2> .
<T_3> , <T_2> &apos;re <T_1> . <T_4> son isn &apos;t . <T_0> d@@ are you ? &quot;
i would <T_7> that <T_4> and culture , <T_2> this is why <T_0> and culture are so incredibly interesting in <T_6> times <T_1> &apos;re living in now , have pro@@ ven <T_8> one can create <T_5> kind of a space which <T_9> both sensi@@ tive <T_3> individu@@ ality and to colle@@ ctivity .
it &apos;s a <T_1> sa@@ d <T_0> .
and <T_0> are going to distur@@ b <T_1> dreams <T_2> we <T_3> the right <T_4> .
<T_3> &apos;s lower than <T_1> figure in <T_0> united <T_2> .
<T_3> will see the <T_0> evolution of <T_1> kind <T_2> busin@@ ess@@ -@@ class mor@@ ality .
that <T_3> a jo@@ ke , <T_2> , and <T_0> -- <T_1> .
<T_2> that &apos;s evidence <T_0> people have <T_1> ex@@ changing <T_3> groups .
<T_2> was a <T_1> years <T_6> , but i sort of <T_3> this story , <T_4> i told <T_0> at a <T_5> .
<T_0> i took <T_1> hus@@ b@@ ands <T_2> .
it &apos;s concep@@ tu@@ al . <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> . <T_1> &apos;s beyond <T_2> and <T_4> .
<T_3> , <T_4> &apos;s <T_0> kind of funny <T_2> he <T_5> up and <T_1> .
<T_0> this is my <T_1> , <T_2> .
<T_5> &apos;s clear <T_1> we have <T_4> responsibility <T_0> help li@@ ft <T_2> out <T_3> poverty .
well , one of the things <T_1> discovered is <T_6> exper@@ ts <T_3> that one <T_4> to what i did at the end was <T_5> piece of <T_9> , the <T_0> , to help <T_8> get past <T_7> seem@@ ingly ir@@ rational choices <T_2>
<T_2> you have <T_6> gra@@ ms , <T_0> , <T_3> kil@@ ogra@@ m , he <T_8> gr@@ ind it for it <T_5> you ; the <T_1> will not <T_4> such a small <T_7> .
and of course , from <T_2> , we <T_1> go and <T_0> in and see , well , what are young <T_3> looking at ?
a <T_0> years ago , we <T_1> &apos;t .
then <T_1> character <T_3> a half-@@ woman , half-@@ chee@@ ta@@ h -- a <T_0> ho@@ mage <T_4> my life <T_2> an ath@@ le@@ te .

it <T_2> for 1,@@ 1@@ 14 <T_0> , lin@@ king <T_3> with <T_1> and shanghai .
so <T_3> &apos;m holding <T_1> , and i &apos;m about to touch <T_6> tube <T_5> its <T_4> , and <T_2> i do , you &apos;ll see <T_0> coming out .
<T_5> can get sho@@ wers up <T_4> 8@@ 6 percent working , we can get <T_3> systems up to <T_2> percent working , <T_1> we can get 90 percent of <T_0> working in <T_6> 7@@ ,@@ 500 <T_7> .
<T_1> is actually <T_0> heart val@@ ve , which we engine@@ ered .

<T_1> i <T_0> to do those <T_2> .
no , <T_0> , <T_2> , <T_1> , no .
what happened <T_1> is <T_6> very <T_2> docum@@ ented what happens over and over <T_0> when <T_4> comes for the <T_7> time <T_3> an <T_5> and a <T_8> .
another <T_1> that we &apos;ve used <T_0> actually that of printing .
we <T_1> to add entrepreneur@@ ship <T_2> policy <T_0> .
<T_2> i was saying <T_3> all the time , every <T_4> , <T_1> i started to <T_0> my <T_5> .
<T_0> they &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m just saying , you <T_1> .
<T_1> also have <T_3> citizens now who <T_7> a lot of <T_2> -- some <T_6> them <T_0> this <T_5> , with <T_4> founda@@ tions .
<T_1> please raise your hand if <T_2> &apos;d say you are right of center <T_0> con@@ servative .
big <T_4> team . <T_2> had a film <T_1> , a <T_3> of logi@@ stics people with us , my <T_5> , a <T_0> .
and mr@@ i <T_1> ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely <T_0> for <T_5> tumor@@ s , <T_3> it &apos;s <T_4> very <T_2> .
so it <T_1> to get <T_0> .

today i &apos;m going to show you <T_2> electric <T_3> that wei@@ gh@@ s less than a <T_6> , that <T_4> can carry with you <T_7> , that you can charge off <T_0> normal wall out@@ let in <T_1> minutes , and <T_9> can run it for 1,000 <T_8> on about a dollar <T_5> electricity .

and <T_2> wee@@ k@@ ly audience at that <T_3> was between <T_4> to <T_1> million <T_0> .
<T_4> thesis for you <T_3> that <T_0> comb@@ ining <T_6> , <T_7> , priv@@ at@@ e-@@ public , <T_8> communication , together , in <T_2> 21@@ st century , we can create <T_5> sum of <T_1> security .
<T_0> like <T_5> and steve are <T_7> information <T_3> information , re@@ al-@@ time information , <T_6> it and <T_2> it onto <T_1> maps for <T_4> to use .
and the point <T_7> when <T_2> lie <T_8> a <T_3> bed <T_5> day , all you do is <T_6> at <T_1> ro@@ of , <T_0> it &apos;s a <T_4> sh@@ it@@ ty experience .
<T_0> &apos;s bill <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
<T_0> , this is <T_2> something <T_3> and <T_1> to do .
we &apos;re already starting to see <T_0> re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment <T_1> this year .
and <T_1> then , <T_8> was sitting <T_4> class , <T_2> suddenly it hit <T_7> : i could comb@@ ine <T_0> i was <T_5> about , carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , with what <T_6> was <T_3> to be thinking about , <T_9> .
<T_3> let &apos;s go back <T_5> safety , because everybody after <T_6> had to reas@@ s@@ ess the safety of <T_8> , and one of the things when i set out to <T_0> a power re@@ ac@@ tor was it had to be passi@@ vely <T_2> in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally safe , <T_9> i &apos;m really excited about <T_1> re@@ ac@@ tor for <T_7> two <T_4> .
<T_2> have been changed <T_0> my <T_1> .
&quot; <T_4> our case is <T_3> , so <T_1> must think <T_0> and act <T_2> .
with <T_4> largest <T_2> of medi@@ ca@@ id <T_0> , <T_1> of those has at least 20,000 <T_3> students .
let <T_2> just show <T_1> map <T_0> ri@@ o again .
or can <T_2> move beyond my <T_0> and <T_1> me for who <T_4> truly <T_3> inside ?
<T_0> you . <T_1> you .
it <T_1> the <T_0> of feynman diagra@@ ms .
<T_2> say , <T_3> don &apos;t really want to live in a <T_1> teen@@ y conventional <T_0> .
<T_1> experiments <T_0> incredibly simple .
so , as <T_3> kel@@ ly <T_1> out , <T_2> is <T_0> end@@ game .
<T_5> : so let &apos;s do it . <T_4> dan do you <T_0> to <T_3> everyone about what <T_1> &apos;re going to <T_2> now ?
<T_3> what is most important here <T_2> , <T_0> do <T_1> finance ?
essentially <T_0> &apos;s propaganda .
so we <T_0> explor@@ ing <T_1> material called <T_2> .
<T_6> of them actually , fit@@ t@@ ingly enough , found <T_0> when <T_7> che@@ cked <T_4> a del@@ i <T_3> a <T_5> in <T_2> york on <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;ve tri@@ pl@@ ed the miles that <T_2> drive <T_0> 19@@ 70 and <T_4> them <T_3> 198@@ 2 .
some people <T_0> , &quot; well , that &apos;s just because those <T_2> types are <T_1> . &quot;
and <T_1> say <T_2> me , &quot; <T_0> comp@@ la@@ ining . &quot;
<T_8> , to do <T_4> , we <T_6> to be able to bring <T_7> camera and <T_1> in together <T_5> one <T_2> tube , <T_9> that <T_0> you saw in <T_3> la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y video .
and <T_0> actually don &apos;t have a lot of <T_1> .
that &apos;s what it feels <T_0> to <T_1> .
<T_0> here &apos;s her <T_1> .
<T_2> fe@@ der@@ al government <T_1> most <T_0> .
and <T_0> you spend <T_6> days <T_3> things off , <T_5> your <T_7> and <T_2> more ent@@ ren@@ ched <T_1> your <T_4> thinking .
<T_0> &apos;ve got to put <T_2> what &apos;s been <T_1> .
i &apos;ve car@@ ried <T_1> photograph with <T_0> every day <T_2> then .
i &apos;ve got five <T_2> of ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment here in order to get <T_3> head@@ rest in <T_0> right <T_1> .
and <T_4> &apos;re really making a <T_3> of progress <T_1> coming up <T_2> a theory <T_0> mind .
<T_3> would be <T_5> olymp@@ ic <T_2> : turn <T_0> squ@@ irre@@ l <T_6> -- wh@@ o@@ ever cat@@ ches <T_4> squ@@ irre@@ l , you get a gold <T_1> .
a lot of <T_0> of young children <T_1> wa@@ sted .
so <T_3> made up my mind <T_2> that <T_5> that <T_0> music is for <T_1> . <T_4> .
<T_2> are <T_1> frequ@@ ently part of <T_0> care .
it &apos;s <T_1> har@@ sh <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> a stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry tree or a <T_2> .
<T_0> intelligent <T_5> prev@@ ents in@@ ju@@ ries <T_2> the power is <T_3> off , until an <T_4> plu@@ g is <T_6> . <T_1> .
it <T_0> four <T_1> .
as re@@ moved as <T_0> the <T_4> society may feel from a <T_9> in <T_1> , or a series of broken tre@@ a@@ ties <T_6> years ago , <T_7> still have to ask you <T_5> question , <T_3> should you <T_2> about the statistics <T_8> today ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that many , many muslims <T_6> -- the vast maj@@ ority , in fact -- in fact i <T_0> i would <T_2> so far as to say that many muslims in <T_5> arab@@ ia believe that <T_9> core values of islam , nam@@ ely <T_8> of god &apos;s <T_3> and basic <T_1> equality before god , are themselves com@@ pati@@ ble <T_4> liber@@ ty , equality <T_7> free political choice .
this <T_1> a picture <T_0> f@@ og@@ ging .
so <T_5> idea <T_2> collective <T_3> is something that will become even <T_4> in the <T_1> , <T_6> this <T_0> cho@@ sen as <T_7> example .
but <T_2> want to <T_4> , above <T_1> , a big@@ -@@ picture positive <T_3> this <T_0> .
but <T_0> &apos;s not <T_1> enough .
and you &apos;re looking at it <T_1> the off@@ ices <T_3> you <T_0> a <T_4> of <T_5> between <T_2> pieces .
one <T_0> later , how she is .
then <T_2> can &apos;t get any <T_6> because <T_1> don &apos;t have a <T_4> supply , so <T_3> don &apos;t have <T_0> oxygen or <T_5> .
and <T_0> a lot of that <T_4> about <T_3> , it &apos;s <T_1> so much about <T_2> .
<T_3> the <T_2> won ! <T_0> is the one they <T_1> .
less <T_1> less <T_0> will be <T_2> .
<T_2> focus <T_0> the <T_1> option .
<T_1> can <T_0> dna origami for that .
<T_3> people don &apos;t need the <T_2> dollars <T_5> , <T_8> wouldn &apos;t <T_6> think <T_7> &apos;d like to <T_0> it <T_1> to make <T_4> look sil@@ ly ?
here &apos;s how to do it <T_0> room temperature <T_3> pressure , <T_1> non-@@ toxic <T_2> . &quot;
<T_0> eco@@ si@@ a <T_2> in pretty much the <T_1> way .
<T_0> is like an <T_3> ka@@ poor flo@@ wing <T_1> a <T_2> ser@@ ra .
<T_5> climate has <T_2> . <T_1> will <T_0> you : no <T_4> f@@ loo@@ ding , no <T_3> fir@@ es .
but at <T_4> certain <T_0> , <T_5> of us <T_2> to leave <T_3> of visions behind <T_1> grow up .
<T_1> it was absolutely <T_0> .
so they were <T_2> questions that were <T_0> to exper@@ t <T_1> .
we &apos;re doing <T_1> . we &apos;re doing <T_0> .
i <T_1> , &quot; <T_2> many <T_3> you now <T_0> home earlier <T_4> you used to ? &quot;
but in <T_1> , <T_0> destruction of <T_2> self was <T_4> repe@@ ti@@ tive <T_5> i <T_3> to see a pattern .
<T_1> you know <T_0> ?
they were <T_0> sc@@ ary <T_3> to <T_2> the car@@ ic@@ ature of <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling <T_1> . <T_3> can &apos;t get out of it .
she took him <T_1> the v@@ et <T_0> the v@@ et <T_2> something quite <T_3> .
<T_7> as <T_6> get a little bit <T_1> , it <T_4> looking like <T_5> of pi@@ pes , like maybe <T_8> chemical plant , or a <T_0> , <T_2> maybe <T_9> hel@@ lish <T_3> inter@@ change .
<T_1> there &apos;s anybody <T_3> the audience that would like <T_2> volunte@@ er to <T_0> eating ?
now <T_2> did <T_0> very <T_1> experiment .
so <T_0> ran@@ g <T_2> , <T_4> paul far@@ mer <T_3> he <T_1> help .
<T_2> we <T_3> see them <T_0> their <T_6> , <T_7> can see <T_4> through the effects that <T_5> have on <T_1> .
that &apos;s <T_1> we need care from <T_0> parents .
having <T_5> a <T_2> path , i <T_0> hold <T_1> hand <T_3> that path <T_4> infin@@ itely many <T_6> jo@@ in@@ t con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions .
and <T_4> are <T_0> kinds <T_9> play -- <T_5> for finger de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity , word games <T_1> reading success , large motor play , small motor play . i feel like <T_2> could de@@ vote <T_6> life to <T_8> out <T_7> to <T_3> with my kids . &quot;
<T_5> the kind of <T_0> that can be done <T_1> be determin@@ ed <T_2> a variety of <T_8> who <T_4> to be involved and can <T_3> the <T_7> to the <T_6> .
do <T_3> have the <T_1> to <T_0> up to a serious <T_2> ?
there <T_5> many many <T_4> that <T_1> fil@@ ters <T_2> that takes <T_3> out of <T_0> .
and <T_3> is <T_2> gei@@ ger , who &apos;s one of the <T_0> of the u.s. public health <T_1> .
he <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> gra@@ ham , the <T_1> . &quot;
now , what you &apos;re having here <T_2> basically a <T_1> brain that you &apos;re <T_6> to <T_0> lots of kind of <T_3> on to <T_5> what it &apos;s <T_4> .
when <T_6> molecule incre@@ ases <T_3> a certain amount -- which says something <T_4> the number of <T_0> -- it lo@@ cks down <T_2> that re@@ cep@@ tor and information <T_7> into <T_9> cells that <T_5> the <T_8> to turn on this <T_1> behavior of making light .
what <T_2> &apos;re looking at here is <T_1> insi@@ di@@ ous <T_0> of <T_3> .
<T_2> we <T_1> don &apos;t know why <T_0> is happening .
it is <T_5> anybody with <T_2> to a $ 1,500 computer who can take <T_7> and <T_1> from the <T_3> around <T_8> and <T_4> it <T_6> say things <T_0> .
<T_1> the same -- <T_5> , <T_8> we could <T_6> that <T_9> &apos;d <T_0> have an <T_7> supply , because <T_3> trans@@ mu@@ tation <T_2> be a fusion re@@ ac@@ tor -- and <T_4> ?
<T_5> back then , video camer@@ as were just starting to become popular , and <T_1> would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . and since <T_3> came in on a fri@@ day , they were <T_4> to get this great foot@@ age of this thing <T_2> up as <T_9> came in <T_0> west <T_6> , mar@@ y@@ land , <T_7> and new jer@@ se@@ y <T_8> it did that to a car in new york .

right ?
and so <T_2> were very <T_1> about the way that they <T_0> car@@ -@@ sharing .
<T_6> , <T_3> question i <T_1> get <T_0> this talk -- so i <T_5> i &apos;d answer <T_7> now -- is , well , <T_2> happens <T_4> the <T_8> ?
<T_2> , <T_0> , <T_3> , sna@@ ke . <T_4> , let &apos;s see <T_1> we got .
<T_4> whole <T_9> brea@@ ds histor@@ ically have had sort of <T_2> on@@ us of being health food <T_6> , and people don &apos;t <T_7> to eat , quote , health food . they like to <T_0> healthy and health@@ ily , but when <T_5> think of something as a <T_3> food , we think of it as something we eat out of ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , <T_1> out of <T_8> and love for the fla@@ vor .
<T_3> there are emotional <T_0> that <T_2> through <T_1> networks .
<T_1> , what usually happens <T_3> we &apos;re <T_2> to <T_5> min@@ d@@ ful is that <T_0> get distra@@ cted by <T_4> thought .
mar@@ ge simp@@ son : hom@@ er , please .
and <T_1> didn &apos;t mean , you know -- where <T_0> that <T_2> ?
<T_6> biggest <T_2> , the <T_1> , <T_8> the <T_4> well measu@@ red , until <T_0> than 3,000 ar@@ go <T_3> were <T_7> around <T_5> world &apos;s ocean .
this <T_0> their <T_1> video .
is <T_0> possible ? is <T_1> really <T_3> that <T_2> could do this ? &quot;
<T_3> comes <T_2> the clin@@ ic , they <T_1> a fe@@ ver , they feel <T_5> . <T_0> do <T_4> have ?
<T_0> &apos;ve got to <T_2> them up with <T_1> .

but <T_2> you so much for <T_1> . that <T_0> absolutely <T_3> .
now <T_0> &apos;d ask , can <T_1> be done at <T_2> ?
<T_1> &apos;s always a <T_2> scen@@ ari@@ o that you can <T_3> out where it &apos;s possible that something could have been done <T_0> .
<T_1> is a <T_0> one .
<T_3> of course , we <T_2> &apos;t <T_1> all <T_0> .

<T_1> , <T_2> kind <T_0> thing became popular .
<T_3> &apos;s right , <T_0> do have christmas <T_2> , <T_1> it turns out .
but then <T_2> it grew <T_5> 12 <T_3> , <T_1> those are the <T_4> stars on the <T_0> fla@@ g .
then <T_3> sort of cut up the <T_0> , <T_4> we wouldn &apos;t block the view <T_2> my <T_1> .
if we <T_9> a little bit further <T_1> in our little tour of the world , we <T_7> go to the bo@@ li@@ vian edge of the <T_2> , here also in 197@@ 5 , <T_0> if you look really <T_5> , there &apos;s a thin <T_8> line through that kind of <T_6> , and there &apos;s a l@@ one far@@ mer out there in <T_3> middle of the <T_4> jung@@ le .

indeed , we <T_3> a lot of <T_0> from our <T_1> in the human <T_2> .
sometimes i <T_1> back to <T_0> night in <T_2> e.@@ r .
<T_3> the same time , we actually had a <T_4> -- <T_1> minister <T_2> a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an <T_5> to our <T_0> .

and <T_7> &apos;s <T_5> of like a high al@@ titude moun@@ ta@@ ine@@ ering trip <T_0> re@@ verse , <T_3> that you &apos;re <T_6> running <T_2> str@@ ing of <T_4> things <T_1> .
<T_4> started <T_0> , <T_3> then <T_5> tried to remember to go <T_2> the <T_1> .
and someone <T_2> just <T_5> youtube -- <T_1> was <T_4> youtube com@@ ment : &quot; <T_7> time <T_0> s@@ mil@@ ed <T_3> a <T_6> . &quot;
<T_0> see it <T_1> like this .
now <T_0> didn &apos;t hear those <T_5> from <T_2> poor <T_3> , i heard them from <T_4> sun@@ day school teacher and <T_6> , kind <T_1> vi@@ a my sun@@ day school teacher .
let &apos;s <T_1> them a <T_2> of cas@@ h for this and <T_3> what <T_0> think .
<T_4> is the reason why i felt <T_1> was <T_5> that i pres@@ ented <T_2> with this copy of <T_0> gay <T_3> .
<T_1> -- so the way i saw this in <T_3> mind at <T_6> , was that the <T_9> would explo@@ de up and out with <T_7> speed , and the pieces would move far out , and <T_4> they would begin to be pulled back with a kind <T_2> a gravit@@ ational <T_8> , <T_0> the point where they would approach <T_5> speed back to the center .
<T_2> &apos;ll have cities <T_1> no energy <T_0> no food .
<T_1> the oil and min@@ ing <T_2> , <T_6> example , <T_4> is now <T_7> beginning of <T_0> truly <T_3> standard that could t@@ ack@@ le some of these <T_5> .
so if i gave <T_1> that <T_2> , <T_3> don &apos;t want <T_4> go <T_5> long on <T_0> .
and we <T_1> s@@ ank the <T_5> , <T_6> i became <T_7> with moun@@ ting <T_3> . <T_2> over the <T_8> 49 <T_0> , i &apos;ve done about <T_9> , 12@@ 1 -- i keep <T_4> them -- expedi@@ tions .
<T_5> really <T_7> that that <T_3> because -- as <T_0> would tell me <T_8> and over -- that &apos;s the only <T_1> people know <T_6> they &apos;re getting <T_9> terms of the <T_2> and the <T_4> quality .

<T_7> all <T_3> ten@@ se moments of conflict <T_2> all the conflict <T_9> of the <T_8> , there &apos;s one <T_0> from a much <T_6> place that <T_5> me still , much <T_4> than the <T_1> .

<T_2> me into <T_0> wir@@ es , put me <T_1> sleep , gave <T_4> the mus@@ cle <T_3> .
we &apos;ve had the biggest <T_2> of any <T_4> subject <T_0> i <T_3> ever imagine <T_1> computers .
and <T_1> you turn <T_2> switch on , the <T_0> goes on .
now , did all of <T_1> end with <T_3> islam@@ ic <T_0> in <T_2> ?
<T_1> i <T_0> ate it up .
<T_0> &apos;ve had <T_1> great me@@ als <T_2> caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as .
it activ@@ ates the <T_1> areas in the <T_0> .

<T_1> , steve , look <T_0> .
so , on au@@ gu@@ st <T_0> , <T_5> day , <T_3> , the <T_1> of <T_4> set out to <T_2> ah@@ me@@ dab@@ ad .

<T_6> know <T_5> you are angry , and <T_8> know that you would almost wish to have <T_4> opportunity to <T_9> now into <T_7> of re@@ ven@@ ge . but , &quot; <T_3> said , &quot; what i really want you to <T_2> is <T_1> i know how <T_0> feel .
<T_8> financial crisis <T_4> really <T_1> relatively small histor@@ ic <T_3> , <T_5> has just <T_7> this huge <T_2> , <T_6> ends half <T_0> millenni@@ um of western as@@ cen@@ dan@@ cy .
and <T_1> came <T_0> a <T_2> conclusion .
and so if <T_3> can do that , then <T_4> can free up <T_6> for buying drugs that you really do need for <T_0> aids and <T_7> and <T_5> and <T_1> prev@@ ent@@ ing <T_2> flu . thank <T_8> .
the hei@@ ght of <T_4> mountains <T_0> either <T_2> of this valley <T_3> greater than the al@@ ps <T_5> most <T_1> .
and so <T_1> thought , well , what the <T_0> .
<T_0> goes up , heart <T_1> goes up .
<T_5> the &apos; 8@@ 0s and &apos; <T_4> when islam@@ ism started <T_2> the <T_3> , <T_0> spread across <T_1> men@@ a region as a <T_6> .
<T_5> so there <T_4> this blog <T_1> a young <T_8> who was <T_7> of depres@@ sed , <T_3> he <T_2> , &quot; you <T_9> , i &apos;m <T_6> a <T_0> . &quot;
of <T_0> , we know <T_3> that <T_4> ex@@ tend far <T_1> our own <T_2> .
so , it &apos;s <T_3> . all <T_2> need <T_1> those top <T_0> teachers .
<T_1> , <T_4> , as i <T_0> , i <T_5> , car <T_2> ada@@ pt , <T_3> ?
i found that <T_0> didn &apos;t have to wear high he@@ els , i <T_1> &apos;t have to <T_3> p@@ ink , and <T_2> could feel like i <T_4> in .
so <T_2> &apos;s a lot of great <T_4> , <T_3> i &apos;d <T_6> to <T_5> more <T_1> getting <T_0> .
with him and <T_1> ro@@ sal@@ ie , what seems to be <T_0> on -- and <T_6> said , &quot; <T_2> &apos;s going on ? &quot; -- and i <T_7> that as you lose vision , as <T_4> visual parts of the <T_8> are no longer getting any in@@ put , they become hyper@@ active and <T_9> , and <T_5> start to fire <T_3> .
that &apos;s a <T_0> gross <T_2> business . <T_1> like it .
<T_2> is actually <T_1> one of -- the paper <T_0> she transl@@ ated .
<T_0> we all make <T_1> with a <T_3> , <T_2> context , in <T_4> ?
and <T_1> current , electrical <T_2> , is car@@ ried <T_3> electr@@ ons , <T_5> like <T_0> your <T_4> and so on .
<T_1> had to study <T_0> study <T_2> .
<T_1> of course , today , with the technology of the computer <T_2> with <T_0> rapid prototyp@@ ing , etc . , we have the <T_6> to <T_3> and to <T_5> to these systems , and to allow them to adjust to the various <T_7> of func@@ tion@@ alities <T_8> that &apos;s <T_9> we <T_4> .
but <T_1> beauty <T_4> it is <T_3> it &apos;s <T_0> silk <T_2> sticks .
<T_4> , really <T_2> challenging the <T_1> of <T_0> can be consi@@ dered a <T_3> .
<T_3> &apos;m a contemporary <T_2> and <T_4> show <T_0> art g@@ aller@@ ies and <T_1> .
<T_1> then <T_0> innova@@ tions within that .
we <T_6> fortunate to work with another <T_7> at <T_3> that built <T_5> a special <T_2> sens@@ or , <T_4> we were able to <T_1> the force of <T_0> individual hair .
and two <T_5> which <T_0> you -- bit@@ ter and <T_2> , <T_1> are against <T_3> and ro@@ tten <T_4> .
<T_0> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> really <T_1> reasons for this .
<T_4> one , this <T_2> because <T_0> repres@@ ents more <T_1> a <T_3> people .
where <T_2> goes in <T_1> future <T_3> questi@@ oned . <T_4> that &apos;s <T_0> human part .
so <T_3> won <T_1> competition to build <T_2> u.k. <T_0> .
so <T_1> have to have the <T_2> to apply them <T_3> the right <T_0> .
<T_1> some , in <T_0> event , are <T_4> big <T_3> use for <T_2> .
<T_3> even <T_0> a <T_2> , about <T_1> person a month was killed <T_4> run over .
in <T_9> , chris was wor@@ ried <T_4> said , &quot; <T_3> , don &apos;t show them <T_1> slide , because <T_8> &apos;re just going to <T_5> you &apos;re <T_6> one of <T_7> crazy <T_2> artists who doesn &apos;t do <T_0> .
<T_1> that care <T_0> also you <T_2> .
and before <T_2> say <T_5> is out <T_0> this <T_6> , <T_4> should first make sure that <T_3> &apos;s not in <T_1> world .
<T_1> work with t@@ w@@ y@@ la <T_3> a lot , and i work with <T_2> mor@@ ris a lot , who is <T_4> of my best <T_0> .
<T_2> is <T_5> going to <T_3> ; <T_0> this <T_1> done by hand with <T_4> rules .
it &apos;s actually from <T_0> r@@ ab@@ in .

so <T_1> fla@@ ws are <T_0> key .
so what <T_0> you could do the <T_1> thing with a <T_2> or a battery <T_3>
it &apos;s not giving me <T_0> last two <T_2> . i &apos;m going to give <T_1> .
now <T_3> understand how con@@ gress came <T_6> write a bill that won &apos;t <T_9> its st@@ ated <T_0> , <T_1> will produce a lot of <T_2> side effects , you <T_5> to understand <T_7> little bit <T_4> the back <T_8> .
and that became the <T_2> plan in <T_0> , <T_4> has been <T_1> plan ever <T_3> .
first they don &apos;t <T_0> .
this was an <T_4> . <T_3> came to understand and to <T_5> that the brown <T_7> that <T_1> see today was not done by leon@@ ardo da <T_6> , which left us only <T_2> other drawing that for <T_0> centuries we were not able to see , so <T_8> only to <T_9> .
so <T_1> can click on things <T_0> re@@ move it .
<T_1> can &apos;t know what &apos;s going on <T_3> -- let <T_0> an inse@@ ct &apos;s -- another <T_2> being &apos;s mind .
<T_5> &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , <T_1> is <T_4> picture <T_3> here <T_0> i@@ . and what does <T_2> matter ? &quot;
and <T_3> you look <T_5> the name of one <T_2> those streets , <T_6> street , <T_4> can tell what <T_0> going on there 300 <T_1> ago .
un@@ aids <T_1> us <T_4> the <T_2> rate <T_3> z@@ ambi@@ a is <T_6> percent , and mortality esti@@ mates <T_0> it &apos;s only about <T_5> percent .
it glo@@ ws from <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
now i <T_1> going to speak to you <T_0> my <T_2> .
<T_4> let <T_3> give you a <T_0> perspective <T_2> the same <T_1> .
<T_0> the sha@@ do@@ w <T_1> the ball <T_3> its own <T_2> .
<T_3> what the dna sequen@@ cing <T_7> people to do <T_1> is do <T_5> studies <T_2> , <T_4> , 100 <T_0> who have cro@@ hn &apos;s disease <T_6> 100 people who <T_8> &apos;t have cro@@ hn &apos;s disease .
<T_3> satur@@ day , set a day asi@@ de , <T_5> yourself <T_1> beautiful day , and <T_0> sa@@ vor@@ ing and <T_2> to <T_6> those <T_4> .
wealth <T_1> ri@@ pped away from people who <T_3> &apos;t <T_0> called <T_2> .
<T_2> had <T_1> idea i would have <T_0> ph@@ .@@ d .
the <T_5> of the <T_2> and of the wea@@ po@@ ns <T_6> mass destruction <T_1> that , <T_7> , <T_4> share a dest@@ iny <T_0> my <T_3> .
we <T_1> , <T_0> for him , but for <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;re done , <T_1> you <T_0> .
<T_3> of course <T_0> around <T_2> world are all <T_4> , all stri@@ ctly <T_1> .
which <T_3> one <T_2> to <T_5> that <T_0> pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment may be <T_1> gl@@ ue that holds <T_4> together .
but <T_0> was <T_2> the end of the <T_1> .
i <T_2> , people <T_1> know about this <T_0> .
<T_1> of the works <T_0> no <T_2> , <T_3> .
<T_4> i do <T_0> to introduce you to a <T_6> of fol@@ ks <T_2> may <T_5> , <T_3> you saw &quot; bridge <T_1> tun@@ ne@@ l . &quot;
these <T_1> ideas <T_0> complex questions <T_3> very <T_4> when you are <T_2> vulnerable .
what <T_0> it mean to say that there &apos;s an <T_1> democracy ?
so , i think <T_2> this can probably bring <T_0> to most <T_4> countries <T_3> the u.s. , <T_5> maybe <T_6> &apos;s <T_1> can go up again .
i &apos;m looking for <T_1> opportunity to create <T_0> ei@@ ff@@ el to@@ wer moment , we <T_2> it .
<T_6> kni@@ ghts tem@@ pl@@ ar <T_5> very quickly <T_2> they <T_3> &apos;t face the zet@@ as on violence <T_0> , and so they <T_1> a <T_7> as a <T_4> enter@@ prise .
<T_1> it &apos;s v@@ ital we understand <T_0> .
there <T_2> just <T_0> art@@ fully plac@@ ed blo@@ bs of <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s a <T_2> bigger piece <T_0> i <T_3> explor@@ ing the space of a <T_4> .
<T_2> calcu@@ lation <T_4> that quantum tun@@ n@@ eling <T_7> the hig@@ gs field is not likely to <T_5> in the <T_3> 10 <T_1> the 100 years , <T_0> this is <T_6> very long <T_8> .
so , what your <T_5> means : i &apos;ve got to <T_4> you , we <T_1> all <T_3> a <T_2> , <T_6> political offici@@ als are <T_0> pin@@ at@@ as .
now , the ad@@ ded one , apart from this immedi@@ acy , negative , this <T_0> , <T_3> you have a <T_2> of <T_1> .
<T_7> one area which is particularly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing for <T_6> is the <T_2> region , you know , of mars , close to <T_9> north pole , <T_4> we <T_3> ice cap@@ s , and we <T_5> the ice cap@@ s shr@@ in@@ king <T_1> exp@@ and@@ ing , so <T_8> &apos;s very much like you have in northern <T_0> .
and also <T_9> wanted <T_1> free up the <T_6> , so the sound actually <T_0> through , condu@@ cts <T_8> to <T_7> b@@ ones in your cr@@ ani@@ um , <T_4> is a little <T_3> fre@@ ak@@ y at first , <T_2> you get used <T_5> it .
<T_5> &apos;s a really important <T_8> , <T_3> real <T_1> , for@@ war@@ d-@@ thinking <T_4> , and <T_2> told <T_7> two things <T_0> i <T_6> him .
<T_4> yet , it &apos;s <T_0> fif@@ th le@@ ading cause of cancer deaths <T_3> women <T_2> the <T_1> states .
<T_4> finally , <T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> la@@ ven@@ der , <T_3> after a couple of thousand <T_2> , <T_5> &apos;s ink black .
<T_2> this <T_0> not <T_1> case .
<T_0> that <T_2> one of <T_1> reasons .
<T_4> for so <T_0> i &apos;ve <T_3> standing on <T_6> si@@ del@@ ines <T_2> to be a <T_1> , just taking <T_5> .
and in fact , what we <T_7> to do is see <T_2> as <T_9> one , <T_6> it , <T_8> it , and <T_0> that <T_5> need a ch@@ ap@@ ter <T_3> that <T_4> all about execu@@ tion , all about <T_1> ho@@ w-@@ to .
blog@@ gers <T_1> this , or <T_2> worked <T_0> to ex@@ pose <T_3> .

<T_1> a little more <T_0> now .
<T_5> a <T_9> interaction , a <T_2> force partic@@ le , such as <T_8> one , inter@@ acts <T_4> a color@@ ed quar@@ k , such <T_1> this green one , to <T_7> a quar@@ k <T_6> a different <T_3> charge -- this <T_0> one .
this <T_0> what <T_3> in nature . obser@@ vation now allows <T_2> to bring <T_8> natural process <T_1> the <T_4> process <T_6> day . <T_5> &apos;s what <T_7> do .

this image <T_0> three <T_4> wearing gas mas@@ ks <T_6> taken in <T_5> origin@@ ally , <T_8> i <T_3> it in <T_1> ital@@ y , <T_9> the <T_2> sometimes bur@@ y the g@@ arb@@ age <T_7> the ground .
and the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers <T_1> take all the <T_4> to the <T_3> edge of the <T_5> and <T_0> them <T_2> .
<T_2> of con@@ gress <T_1> 18 million <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;re a <T_0> and you &apos;re <T_4> your <T_5> , and <T_1> day six , you <T_6> pu@@ st@@ ul@@ es that <T_3> hard .
whether <T_0> this <T_6> or people <T_2> in <T_7> world , hearing <T_5> of this , may well <T_4> doing the scre@@ am@@ ing-@@ with@@ -@@ rage thing , <T_3> as well , some <T_1> them .
<T_2> into <T_1> fer@@ ment came <T_0> micro@@ process@@ or .
and <T_0> think <T_3> &apos;s also <T_1> of <T_2> .
so imagine <T_1> kid &apos;s al@@ ge@@ bra <T_2> in <T_0> grade .
<T_0> loved <T_1> .
thanks .
and <T_2> felt <T_5> little bit <T_0> , because the <T_4> -- <T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> easy thing to do .
<T_2> don &apos;t want to have <T_3> there is <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_4> in addition to doing <T_1> transplant , we had to find out <T_0> to get a <T_9> chromo@@ some <T_2> of the <T_5> ye@@ ast into <T_3> form where we <T_7> transplant <T_8> into a <T_6> cell .
<T_4> had also had the <T_8> since the last 37 <T_0> to work on several <T_5> as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to as@@ s@@ ess , for example , the state of <T_3> . see <T_6> the face of the ma@@ don@@ na of the chair that when just sh@@ ining a u@@ v light <T_1> it you suddenly see another , different <T_7> , aged <T_9> , <T_2> should rather say .
and this <T_3> is <T_5> pleas@@ ant on <T_0> mind , <T_4> it hel@@ ps <T_2> sent@@ ence to <T_1> right .
so if <T_3> zo@@ om in on this genome , <T_5> what you see , of course , is this double heli@@ x structure -- the <T_2> of life <T_8> out with <T_7> four bio@@ chemical <T_1> , <T_9> we <T_6> them bas@@ es , right : <T_4> , c , <T_0> and t .
<T_3> got <T_1> bit <T_0> up , so did <T_2> .
the <T_9> between <T_1> of what you &apos;re going to do personally , and <T_0> knowing information , can save your life <T_3> and it could mean the <T_4> between <T_2> to <T_8> fat@@ alities <T_7> half a million to <T_5> fat@@ alities <T_6>
<T_3> goes down <T_1> he me@@ ets <T_0> famous <T_2> .
<T_0> , he <T_1> saw this .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a <T_2> way , <T_8> another technology , which is <T_1> better <T_6> anything we have , but <T_5> -- there hasn &apos;t been any enthusias@@ m for ad@@ option <T_9> because <T_3> are so en@@ am@@ ored with <T_7> current car seat <T_4> . <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> that they cra@@ w@@ l <T_0> 20,000 <T_3> 20 <T_2> .
there is <T_0> ras@@ h of suici@@ de <T_1> china .
<T_0> that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns <T_2> those people have all the same <T_8> that <T_7> do and <T_5> still dis@@ agree with <T_6> , then <T_3> move on <T_9> a <T_4> assu@@ mption , which <T_1> that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots .
<T_2> : &quot; <T_1> this <T_3> at <T_0> . &quot;
this <T_0> my medical <T_1> .
<T_1> of all , it &apos;s going to <T_2> a <T_0> about <T_3> .
i <T_9> &apos;t find a <T_8> . what <T_4> did find was a <T_2> that they <T_7> , <T_6> 2@@ 2@@ -year-old <T_0> who <T_1> an accoun@@ t@@ ant <T_3> she played <T_5> them all the time .
<T_7> , here &apos;s another <T_2> secret i &apos;m going to <T_0> you about : for the <T_5> 25 <T_6> , oil <T_1> been playing less and less of a <T_4> in <T_8> energy <T_3> .
<T_0> zo@@ om in .
we <T_5> experiment@@ ing , <T_1> you can see , in terms <T_0> shapes , forms . the <T_9> became <T_2> important , and <T_3> &apos;s become our <T_8> project . it &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been <T_7> for 12 years . and <T_4> supply <T_6> con@@ ran shops , and don@@ na kar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
<T_3> sometimes you &apos;re equi@@ pped with <T_4> , <T_1> they <T_2> not be the kind of skills that <T_0> crea@@ tivity .
<T_0> we &apos;ve <T_1> got <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;ll get <T_1> lon@@ ely , <T_5> sent@@ ence with real <T_7> in it , &quot; <T_0> , i <T_8> i could come <T_4> , but <T_6> for <T_2> minute . &quot;
we built <T_2> -- so we <T_1> 100 different <T_4> over <T_0> last two <T_3> .
<T_6> need for connection , our <T_9> for separ@@ at@@ eness , or our need for security and <T_4> , or our <T_0> for toge@@ th@@ ern@@ ess and for <T_3> , and if you think about the little kid who si@@ ts on your la@@ p and who <T_1> co@@ zi@@ ly ne@@ sted here and very se@@ cure and comfortable , <T_2> at some point all <T_5> us need to go out into the world <T_8> disco@@ ver <T_7> to expl@@ ore .
so i want <T_4> to <T_8> that <T_3> nine <T_0> that i found <T_6> the bin <T_5> the global food <T_1> , <T_7> ? <T_2> start out with nine .
<T_2> was a sur@@ gi@@ cal resi@@ dent <T_0> the john@@ s hopkins hospital , taking <T_1> call .
what <T_2> understood was <T_3> biological diversity -- <T_4> diversity -- <T_5> the biological <T_0> of <T_1> .
<T_4> are <T_8> ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations , s@@ light ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations of <T_6> fundamental <T_0> , which is <T_5> spend a lot more <T_1> re@@ creation of <T_2> kinds than <T_7> rest of <T_3> .
and so thinking <T_5> the models that we &apos;ve just disc@@ us@@ sed , <T_9> see , going forward , that <T_6> engineering is actually po@@ is@@ ed to <T_1> revolutionize drug scre@@ ening at every single step of <T_2> path : disease <T_8> making for better drug for@@ mu@@ lations , mas@@ si@@ vely parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing , reduce animal testing <T_4> human testing <T_3> clinical tri@@ als , and <T_7> therap@@ ies that dis@@ ru@@ pt what we even consider to be <T_0> market at all .
at the end of the <T_1> , you can <T_7> with the discussion of <T_4> we <T_5> pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but <T_0> have to be <T_3> and frank about <T_9> , if there &apos;s <T_8> things <T_2> do , there <T_6> other things we don &apos;t do .
that was <T_2> i put <T_0> as a <T_1> point up there .
and <T_7> , where we &apos;ve gone through <T_9> the last <T_6> years , through <T_4> attemp@@ t to find ways of turning circu@@ its and cells and <T_1> and pa@@ th@@ ways <T_3> the brain on and off , both <T_8> understand the science <T_2> also to con@@ front some of the <T_0> that face us <T_5> as humans .
<T_5> took up the <T_1> -- not <T_0> shoot , not <T_9> kill , not to destroy , but <T_3> stop those who would do <T_7> , to protect the vulnerable , to de@@ fend democra@@ tic values , to stand up for the freedom we have to <T_8> here <T_2> in am@@ ster@@ da@@ m about <T_4> we can make the <T_6> a better place .
and <T_1> most <T_3> , they have a big <T_0> on other <T_2> .
<T_0> was kind of a <T_1> type -- <T_3> un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able , therefore -- <T_4> took his <T_2> out on <T_5> .
now <T_2> i <T_4> in si@@ x@@ th grade , <T_7> public <T_3> all but <T_0> the <T_6> budgets <T_1> the <T_5> public school system .
<T_3> cont@@ ing@@ ent <T_4> to <T_7> quite <T_6> , and <T_5> has <T_1> susta@@ ined any <T_2> , even though <T_8> of peac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers have been <T_0> in liber@@ ia .
and she used to go nuts , every <T_2> minutes or so in the play , <T_7> he said to her , &quot; we must have a word to bring you back <T_1> reality , and the <T_8> , <T_6> de@@ ar , will be &apos; bas@@ ing@@ stoke . &apos; &quot; so every time she got a little nuts , <T_4> would say , &quot; bas@@ ing@@ stoke ! &quot; and <T_9> would say , &quot; bas@@ ing@@ stoke , it <T_5> . &quot; and she <T_3> be <T_0> for a little while .
<T_5> percent <T_1> women <T_6> &apos;t , and 95 percent <T_2> women <T_3> &apos;t know <T_0> it incre@@ ases your <T_4> risk .
let &apos;s say <T_0> &apos;re in <T_1> . all right ?
but <T_5> , <T_3> would like to take you back <T_1> this <T_2> : the <T_0> of <T_4> .
the <T_2> are <T_8> because <T_1> profit actually takes <T_6> enough <T_3> if it <T_7> &apos;t <T_4> , you wouldn &apos;t have <T_0> time to <T_5> it .
for eight <T_1> , <T_0> walked through the ri@@ ft <T_2> .
we <T_1> to figure out <T_2> to <T_0> the <T_3> that <T_4> have .
<T_2> way to <T_0> that <T_1> i ga@@ ther <T_3> dat@@ as@@ ets from around the <T_4> .
there are <T_1> lot of really <T_0> , very <T_4> robotic hands out there <T_3> the <T_2> .
maybe i <T_0> cut there , see <T_2> brain , and <T_3> can change <T_1> cut .
i &apos;m reporting back . i &apos;m <T_4> back <T_0> to say <T_2> when i left <T_3> children &apos;s home i had <T_6> things <T_8> i <T_7> to do . one was to <T_5> my <T_9> , and the other was <T_1> write po@@ e@@ try .
it was a really <T_1> stres@@ s@@ ful <T_0> .
we can call <T_4> place in <T_1> a death <T_2> , because those <T_6> are not killed <T_3> die of <T_0> or <T_5> .
and what <T_4> really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving <T_7> a <T_2> society , a <T_6> in <T_1> the tal@@ ents <T_0> both men <T_5> women are becoming <T_8> and valu@@ ed <T_3> emplo@@ yed .
i &apos;ve been up to its <T_0> gates .
we <T_2> the work <T_1> the u.s. and the u.k. and japan <T_8> australi@@ a , and <T_7> i &apos;m <T_3> to <T_4> that the united states patent office will be roll@@ ing out universal , complete , and total <T_0> , so that <T_6> patent appli@@ cations will now be <T_5> for citi@@ zen <T_9> , beginning this year .
<T_1> i <T_4> just <T_5> and <T_3> was just <T_2> there on <T_0> top of the cham@@ ps-@@ el@@ y@@ sees .
and <T_1> said , let &apos;s measure co2 <T_7> hou@@ se@@ hold , <T_5> when they did that , the <T_8> just <T_2> , cool@@ est in the center <T_9> , war@@ mer in the <T_0> , and red <T_6> in <T_3> ex@@ urban &quot; drive ti@@ ll <T_4> quali@@ fy &quot; neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods .
and the second imp@@ lication <T_7> that the <T_0> will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , <T_5> a con@@ sequence , become <T_3> un@@ familiar to us , because <T_8> &apos;ll be shaped <T_6> cultures and <T_2> and hi@@ stories that we are <T_1> really <T_9> with , or <T_4> with .

we <T_0> look inside with <T_2> time f@@ mr@@ i -- in the <T_1> at real time .
but the thing was , i wrote this , and <T_7> friends read <T_5> , and <T_9> &apos;re like , &quot; <T_0> , that <T_8> , she <T_6> a <T_1> about , <T_2> know , <T_3> a stupid thing <T_4> being stupid . &quot;
<T_1> it &apos;s the <T_2> that brings them <T_0> the table .
but some <T_0> re@@ main back in <T_1> area <T_2> .
so <T_0> asked <T_6> go@@ ose to do it <T_3> , and <T_4> she <T_5> do somehow , a more <T_1> or <T_2> job .

so <T_0> said , &quot; well , you <T_2> , <T_7> &apos;re <T_5> in this <T_4> . you <T_3> : <T_8> &apos;s <T_9> , &quot; was <T_6> i could think of . what is <T_1> ?
<T_1> i <T_0> believe <T_3> this <T_2> is still on@@ going .
now , she is <T_4> to me , and <T_0> am <T_5> close to her , <T_2> you think , <T_3> she <T_1> see you , maybe she can <T_6> you .
the <T_3> part <T_2> , <T_1> do <T_0> do with <T_4> this attention ?
<T_0> are a <T_2> of people <T_1> are frustrated . &quot;
and i find <T_8> very interesting and very <T_4> , <T_0> what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last <T_2> of days is the sense <T_7> going in <T_5> dire@@ ctions : <T_6> that <T_9> specific <T_3> unique to <T_1> .
what i do is i <T_1> books <T_2> the <T_0> history of <T_3> .
well <T_4> our research , we &apos;ve found that <T_7> changes are <T_3> fundamentally in <T_0> uni@@ qu@@ ely human <T_8> to monit@@ or <T_1> -- <T_9> just <T_2> time and <T_5> time , but <T_6> .
to start thinking about saying , &quot; let &apos;s do not <T_9> things <T_1> we can do very little <T_0> a very <T_8> cost , not <T_5> things that we don &apos;t <T_2> how to do , but let &apos;s do the great <T_7> where <T_3> can do an enormous <T_6> of good , at <T_4> low cost , right now . &quot;
<T_0> we <T_1> look forward to <T_2> things .
<T_0> so was darwin .

now , i <T_0> one step <T_4> and <T_6> , &quot; why do we <T_2> to stick with <T_7> sto@@ d@@ gy <T_3> and just have a <T_1> docum@@ ent ? <T_5> &apos;s go <T_8> . &quot;

so <T_5> problems of <T_9> today isn &apos;t <T_7> something <T_0> . it <T_6> been happening since over <T_8> thousand <T_1> ago , but what we don &apos;t <T_4> notice are these <T_2> in <T_3> .
<T_3> all of this goes <T_2> to <T_1> failure <T_5> the d@@ m@@ ca to dis@@ allow <T_4> as a <T_0> means .

so you start to <T_2> these ab@@ u@@ sive <T_8> , <T_9> you don &apos;t <T_5> one <T_3> voice , you hear <T_6> a thousand -- 100,000 <T_4> voices , <T_0> if the de@@ vil <T_7> tou@@ re@@ tte &apos;s , that &apos;s what it would <T_1> like .

<T_0> then <T_1> might come up with <T_2> like this .
that &apos;s what it <T_3> . <T_0> why were we <T_2> to <T_1> ?
i <T_4> thought <T_5> would be <T_0> to <T_1> move around <T_2> campus like <T_3> on <T_6> own .

you <T_7> &apos;t really <T_5> what you see on the <T_8> , and there is a <T_2> to be learned from that , and <T_3> are a lot of <T_1> that <T_4> can grow as <T_6> prof@@ ession <T_0> we actually <T_9> to see this .
<T_3> it <T_2> in <T_1> a <T_5> , and it literally cra@@ cks space , wo@@ b@@ bl@@ ing it <T_4> a <T_0> .
<T_1> she was <T_5> about <T_2> work i did developing <T_4> models <T_6> understanding <T_3> and <T_0> gene@@ tics .
<T_6> , <T_2> moved from <T_4> to <T_3> angeles , and i just <T_1> to say <T_5> word about <T_0> transition , actually .
<T_1> you <T_0> the speed of <T_3> of these ro@@ tors , then <T_2> robot flies up , it ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ates up .
and in order <T_0> do that , i need to <T_1> about <T_2> a little bit .
as are <T_4> new@@ ly emerging <T_1> diseases , names <T_2> you hadn &apos;t heard 20 <T_3> ago : <T_6> , <T_5> , <T_0> .
we <T_1> that <T_0> in@@ fusion incre@@ ases <T_2> in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers <T_3> 80 <T_4> .
how <T_1> life make <T_0> ?
and <T_4> is the new <T_3> , which we <T_8> two , three years back , recogni@@ zing <T_6> our <T_1> paradigm of just analy@@ zing <T_2> pus@@ hing and <T_0> par@@ am@@ e@@ ters <T_9> the <T_7> , a@@ im@@ ing at <T_5> environmental im@@ pac@@ ts , is of the past .
but , to get <T_4> a <T_3> of <T_1> income , <T_2> skills led <T_0> very rapid <T_5> there .
but the point is , <T_8> the <T_2> you &apos;re obser@@ ving can and <T_6> take on a <T_5> variety of <T_7> values across the wi@@ der landscape <T_0> reality , <T_3> thinking one explanation <T_1> a particular <T_9> is <T_4> mis@@ gui@@ ded .
<T_0> let me <T_5> do one <T_1> concep@@ tu@@ al <T_2> : <T_7> i p@@ lot <T_6> as a pro@@ x@@ y <T_3> control of the production process <T_4> scale .
<T_1> the <T_4> is , <T_0> co@@ yo@@ te r@@ uns off <T_3> cli@@ ff <T_2> after him .
so it <T_6> that you can actually <T_2> pretty <T_0> algorithms <T_5> lots of <T_1> kinds of exten@@ d@@ able <T_3> into really simple <T_4> .
<T_1> p@@ aus@@ es , <T_0> he moves again , <T_2> fr@@ aser says , &quot; <T_3> !
and so <T_2> can control that <T_0> micro@@ -@@ controll@@ ers <T_4> create a <T_1> volu@@ metri@@ c , three-@@ dimensional display <T_5> just <T_3> le@@ ds .
we talked about this going all the way back to <T_1> end of the <T_0> war .
<T_1> week later , <T_2> patient would <T_3> back for <T_0> follo@@ w-@@ up exam@@ ination .
they did chicken <T_2> p@@ ie , <T_3> did <T_4> chicken , and <T_0> they finally introdu@@ ced <T_1> mc@@ nug@@ gets .
this <T_6> a <T_4> from star <T_3> where <T_5> 3@@ p@@ o <T_0> out and he <T_2> machines making machines . how <T_1> !
we all have <T_0> improve on this sort of thing .
<T_2> &apos;m gon@@ na <T_4> this song , just to <T_0> you how <T_1> woman has made a <T_3> .
jo@@ han <T_0> : let the <T_1> gui@@ de our <T_2>
<T_0> are in <T_1> .
and <T_0> child was sent to <T_2> fo@@ ster home <T_1> three <T_3> .
over <T_6> , they will <T_0> to african <T_3> and <T_1> science in <T_5> we <T_2> only <T_4> .
an <T_1> was defined <T_2> by <T_0> .
<T_5> life is <T_4> , and here <T_6> the <T_3> and <T_7> change : <T_9> have to restore <T_1> auth@@ ority to ju@@ d@@ ges <T_2> offici@@ als to <T_0> and <T_8> the law .
and <T_2> moved <T_1> to <T_0> next level .
<T_3> no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz appl@@ au@@ ds the world &apos;s hei@@ ghten@@ ed <T_0> in <T_2> and <T_6> , <T_4> argu@@ es per@@ su@@ asi@@ vely <T_1> a new <T_5> .
and i <T_0> realized something : that <T_1> was completely <T_2> the dark .
as early as <T_0> , we asked arab@@ s , and <T_4> in general <T_2> the world , what <T_3> ad@@ mi@@ red <T_5> about the <T_1> .
<T_5> : i &apos;m just telling <T_0> to make sure <T_4> places <T_2> well so that <T_7> won &apos;t affect my <T_6> -- the <T_3> , <T_1> know .
<T_2> so that <T_0> the <T_1> .
i <T_0> ti@@ m@@ ely .
<T_0> you have <T_5> people <T_6> , and now this <T_3> them <T_4> , <T_1> last <T_2> , and that &apos;s <T_7> powerful <T_9> to have , to be <T_8> to tra@@ ck this .
so <T_5> arro@@ ws connect <T_8> that are <T_4> at <T_1> same time , and <T_6> direction of the arro@@ ws <T_3> from the <T_0> that &apos;s active <T_9> in time , and the arro@@ whe@@ ad goes to the <T_7> that &apos;s active <T_2> .
<T_2> roo@@ sev@@ elt , he said , &quot; believe <T_0> can , and <T_1> are hal@@ f@@ way <T_3> . &quot;
but the <T_2> professor steve j@@ ones <T_1> how <T_5> actually did solve this <T_0> -- <T_6> and <T_3> , <T_4> and sele@@ ction .
<T_1> : well , i think that there &apos;s <T_4> very <T_2> divi@@ ding line between <T_3> and <T_0> .
<T_2> equ@@ ation , <T_5> , <T_3> you to <T_4> everything -- other than <T_6> -- <T_0> happens <T_1> the universe .
i <T_0> for very simple line <T_1> -- kind of <T_2> looking .
it &apos;s <T_2> entire population <T_1> the <T_0> .
<T_1> teach <T_0> .
<T_0> example , <T_4> can find it <T_3> some phone numbers <T_1> car licen@@ se plates and <T_2> like that .
i &apos;m <T_1> with the idea of what <T_0> when you mer@@ ge <T_4> with <T_3> , <T_2> i remember reading about <T_5> idea of being able <T_9> re@@ program biology , <T_8> the <T_6> , <T_7> from disease and aging .
<T_3> conclu@@ de , i would actually like to <T_1> , <T_5> may think <T_6> is about <T_2> , <T_8> projects , <T_7> in the end <T_0> is about <T_4> .
<T_0> european <T_1> , same thing .
so <T_1> can we actually do <T_0> ?
<T_0> never finished that <T_3> . <T_2> wife left <T_1> .
<T_3> all of the <T_1> , or <T_2> all <T_5> it , is <T_4> through the th@@ i@@ ck@@ ness of <T_0> atmosphere .
in the course of taking <T_0> film to <T_4> in <T_6> west bank , <T_9> ga@@ za and <T_7> east jer@@ us@@ alem , <T_1> have seen the impact that <T_8> one docum@@ ent@@ ary <T_2> can have in <T_3> the <T_5> .
it <T_0> a lot of <T_2> , in@@ san@@ e <T_3> , a <T_1> of attention , <T_4> .
<T_1> , <T_0> compassion is <T_2> to be put in action .
<T_8> that &apos;s boring , <T_9> is <T_1> as <T_3> as having to use a <T_7> every <T_0> you have sex , no matter how dr@@ unk <T_4> are , no matter <T_6> many <T_2> you &apos;ve taken , <T_5> ?

<T_4> can <T_3> remember <T_0> , it <T_1> to look <T_2> this .
and there &apos;s four key ingredients to descri@@ bing that .
and <T_1> said , &quot; s@@ hal@@ low <T_4> : <T_2> in@@ ability to experience a <T_0> of <T_3> . &quot;

<T_5> its <T_1> is more important <T_4> the <T_2> of doing it , it &apos;s <T_3> not <T_0> .
now , <T_7> i talk about this , people <T_2> tell <T_5> , &quot; well , isn &apos;t blank the answer ? &quot; -- organic <T_4> , <T_6> food , g@@ mo@@ s , <T_8> trade sub@@ si@@ dies , <T_9> farm bil@@ ls -- and yeah , we have a <T_0> of good <T_1> here , but not any one of these <T_3> a sil@@ ver bul@@ let .
<T_2> &apos;m <T_0> blog@@ ger , which , probably <T_3> a lot of you , <T_4> different <T_1> .
<T_4> do <T_2> mean to talk about a <T_1> line on <T_0> cur@@ ved <T_3> ?
and <T_5> knew it <T_3> big because , you know , if <T_0> just put a <T_4> to t and <T_1> next to <T_7> , <T_6> have a <T_2> .
<T_1> , <T_0> just want to <T_2> up , it &apos;s got to be a <T_3> . &quot;

<T_5> are essentially trees , <T_0> when you make <T_2> with <T_1> computer program , <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> problem .
that <T_1> means that we have to start thinking <T_4> new <T_6> , and <T_0> think wood is going to <T_7> part <T_3> that solution , <T_5> i &apos;m going to tell <T_2> the story of <T_8> .
<T_3> is a bunch <T_1> software companies -- and what it is is their <T_2> versus their <T_0> -- all <T_4> away , <T_5> everybody <T_6> millions and <T_7> of <T_8> .
and <T_1> you <T_2> children , you <T_0> &apos;t know <T_3> it &apos;s like . &quot;
<T_2> ? <T_1> your hand <T_0> you got that . <T_3> ?
and this <T_2> the <T_0> today , <T_1> years <T_4> , still in <T_3> condition .
why do we all <T_2> the <T_0> in <T_1> street ?
<T_2> started going to <T_0> cri@@ cket <T_3> watch sha@@ h <T_1> .
<T_1> first thing i &apos;m going to tell you about this mam@@ mal <T_4> that it is <T_2> for <T_3> eco@@ systems <T_0> function corre@@ ctly .
<T_9> , on the other <T_8> , is relatively quick , essentially <T_4> , <T_6> effective <T_7> efficient , and fundamentally <T_2> , because <T_1> can &apos;t <T_5> value for very long if <T_3> don &apos;t <T_0> each other .
a <T_1> whose <T_3> had been a prostit@@ ute , <T_0> she was <T_5> prostit@@ ute , and <T_4> boy who &apos;d been in and out of <T_2> .
and <T_1> we enter into <T_0> century , you &apos;ll find more <T_2> half <T_3> man@@ kind <T_4> here .
<T_8> me first show you an <T_0> paradigm that <T_1> used to demon@@ strate <T_4> syn@@ thesis <T_3> happiness <T_2> reg@@ ular old <T_5> . and this <T_7> &apos;t <T_6> .
<T_0> is <T_2> data that goes with that . incredibly <T_1> .
but <T_0> , the world &apos;s <T_1> limit here .
<T_4> best <T_2> minutes of <T_0> entire <T_3> were those <T_1> the olymp@@ ic stadium .
<T_0> you really <T_2> that you might <T_1> some clu@@ es as <T_3> what paul <T_4> to do .
<T_3> &apos;re <T_0> dead . <T_4> &apos;re <T_2> . <T_1> &apos;re fine . &quot;
they also <T_4> get the idea that in some <T_2> they can make more <T_1> promis@@ es to long-term investor@@ s -- the kind <T_7> investor@@ s who will come build <T_8> port , <T_6> the roads , in a new <T_9> -- they <T_0> make more <T_3> promis@@ es if <T_5> do it along with a partner nation .
and now <T_4> have <T_3> percent -- <T_0> 20 years , it &apos;s <T_2> highest rate of separ@@ ation <T_1> g@@ arb@@ age in the world .
<T_0> , that <T_1> kind of <T_2> .
<T_2> , they don &apos;t do that <T_0> gradu@@ ate <T_3> , <T_1> don &apos;t think .
you <T_3> see it <T_4> the <T_0> we raise <T_2> young <T_1> .
so fil@@ ling <T_2> gap <T_7> explanation <T_1> a weird <T_0> with <T_4> -- <T_5> &apos;s indeed <T_3> contemporary art is <T_6> about .
<T_2> : <T_0> was <T_1> old .
<T_2> girl is going <T_0> school with <T_3> laptop <T_1> her head .
<T_1> should <T_0> support their <T_2> ?
do <T_3> think <T_2> sort of thing could really attra@@ ct a <T_0> to <T_1> school ? &quot;
our <T_0> from u@@ c@@ s@@ c <T_6> tag@@ ged elephant se@@ als <T_3> ta@@ gs that are <T_5> on <T_4> heads , that come off <T_2> they <T_1> .
<T_2> , the <T_4> is <T_3> one who <T_5> himself to <T_0> over@@ board a lot of <T_1> .
and <T_5> , <T_4> my <T_2> , would say that <T_0> get my <T_3> from past <T_1> .
i think we <T_2> be a bit more <T_5> , <T_9> , to <T_3> at <T_4> beautiful sight of the sun@@ light bur@@ sting out from <T_0> the clouds and go , &quot; wait a <T_1> , <T_8> &apos;s two <T_6> dancing <T_7> sal@@ sa ! &quot;
so , all of a <T_5> , here <T_3> am , gradu@@ ating from high school in <T_4> , and <T_0> happens , <T_2> we realize <T_1> &quot; <T_6> &quot; went away .

<T_6> does <T_5> happen ? <T_1> want dylan to <T_2> able to do that , and using <T_4> mantra <T_3> motion , <T_0> actually can <T_7> that .
over time , those gas molecules <T_3> into <T_0> blood <T_4> tis@@ su@@ es <T_2> start <T_5> fill you <T_1> .
<T_5> &apos;re pa@@ sting <T_4> -- <T_3> both portraits <T_2> the streets in <T_0> crow@@ ded <T_1> .
at <T_2> moment <T_1> became part <T_0> that bio@@ sphere .
and <T_1> of these <T_3> areas are the areas <T_2> which <T_0> wir@@ es are <T_4> through .
and <T_1> &apos;s it . those are <T_3> four <T_0> of the <T_2> .

the same <T_2> happ@@ end . <T_0> was <T_4> first to <T_1> during the <T_3> spring .
<T_2> the <T_3> five <T_1> we <T_4> to <T_5> the lives of almost <T_0> million babies .

<T_4> of these <T_3> are happening in pla@@ in <T_0> , and <T_1> &apos;re all prote@@ cted <T_2> a force field <T_5> te@@ di@@ ousness .
<T_3> we <T_1> what &apos;s going on <T_2> these houses , <T_0> know .

well , <T_0> is <T_1> steel gu@@ it@@ ar . <T_2> &apos;s an americ@@ an@@ -@@ made <T_3> .
so <T_1> whole <T_0> is <T_2> .
<T_4> although <T_0> great for the music business at <T_3> time , it wasn <T_2> much good <T_1> anything else .

<T_1> can be used in <T_0> ways .
you can <T_1> that it &apos;s like <T_0> billion missing here .

and <T_4> goal <T_8> that the <T_6> be <T_5> and sustainable when <T_1> kids reach <T_3> age -- and i think that &apos;s -- in other words , the <T_2> generation . i think <T_9> &apos;s a <T_7> that we probably all <T_0> .
we really like <T_1> human being story a <T_0> .

<T_3> i want to <T_5> today <T_4> one of <T_0> things <T_1> we <T_2> to <T_8> , which was to think about a <T_6> way of appro@@ aching <T_7> .
<T_0> was <T_2> ? was that <T_1> ?
high-@@ capacity transpor@@ tation means <T_1> lots and lots of <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ve done my <T_2> about the <T_0> .

<T_4> ask <T_1> to always have <T_0> right answer doesn &apos;t allow <T_2> to <T_3> .
so it really makes <T_4> realize <T_2> on@@ us on <T_5> to have to <T_8> at this and <T_3> this and police <T_7> in their <T_1> lives and <T_0> aston@@ ishing that <T_6> .
so <T_2> &apos;ve <T_1> motor <T_0> up there .
<T_0> true <T_2> that path <T_4> be better for <T_1> patients and better for <T_3> .
but <T_1> might feel just <T_4> for <T_6> mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ aged <T_5> can be <T_0> problem <T_7> an <T_2> who needs <T_3> develop fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face relationships .

it &apos;s an important <T_3> for <T_6> to <T_4> -- <T_7> some of <T_0> laws <T_1> broken by accident <T_2> that laws have to <T_5> interpre@@ ted .
<T_4> that &apos;s <T_1> of what has been <T_3> spirit <T_0> what <T_2> are doing .

now , the <T_2> of this <T_0> not <T_1> techni@@ que that you &apos;ve seen here .
<T_5> is <T_1> unlikely <T_4> taliban would <T_0> be able to take over the <T_6> -- extremely <T_2> they &apos;d be able to <T_3> kab@@ u@@ l .

now we want those devices , of course , to be de@@ plo@@ yed <T_5> those who are in the <T_3> , our <T_2> , <T_9> primary care physi@@ cians , who see <T_6> child , and we need to <T_4> those technologies <T_8> something that is going to add value <T_7> their practice , <T_1> they have to see so many <T_0> .
in <T_0> it really was the <T_2> who had <T_1> do it .
all <T_1> one guy , this guy <T_3> mor@@ mon , who <T_2> to survive <T_0> hi@@ ding <T_4> the <T_5> .
<T_2> the story of <T_3> we came <T_7> understand <T_4> universe <T_5> just as much <T_0> story of <T_1> as it is by <T_6> .
do <T_2> different . <T_1> do you want to <T_0> ? &quot;
the <T_1> step , follo@@ wing the second step , <T_3> to create <T_2> mental <T_0> .
i <T_0> to ro@@ b a bank in a film . <T_4> want to ro@@ b a bank <T_1> a film , <T_3> do <T_2> with a gun , with a gun , not with a bom@@ b <T_5> around me , right .
<T_6> fact , <T_5> are some countries <T_0> sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an <T_3> where there &apos;s <T_2> op@@ t@@ ome@@ tr@@ ist <T_4> eight <T_1> of the population .
and <T_3> of the <T_2> , or <T_1> easi@@ est , places we can <T_0> and <T_5> that <T_4> to go towards <T_6> .
<T_1> ever , <T_2> miles <T_0> the wrong direction .
<T_2> said , &quot; <T_3> are beautiful . <T_0> have gro@@ wn into <T_1> gor@@ geous <T_4> .
<T_4> ? because your brain is seeing that <T_5> information <T_6> if <T_2> right one is still <T_3> red <T_7> , and <T_0> left one is <T_8> under <T_1> light .
<T_2> you could make <T_3> fun , and make it eight <T_1> 10 <T_7> , <T_0> can &apos;t <T_9> your car , un@@ -@@ park your car , <T_6> your car , re-@@ park your car <T_8> go somewhere ; <T_4> can &apos;t get to a ca@@ b <T_5> a subway .
<T_0> as they &apos;re <T_1> , they &apos;re rais@@ ed <T_5> , all along pro@@ ving <T_3> they &apos;re <T_4> , and <T_2> character .
and we have 26 elephants here , and our <T_1> is <T_2> on the <T_5> of intelligence with <T_4> , <T_7> our foundation think elephants <T_9> focused on bringing <T_8> into <T_6> around the world virtu@@ ally like this and <T_3> people how incredible these animals <T_0> .
<T_0> : <T_1> ! &#91; sp@@ l@@ at &#93; sw : <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;m <T_2> to do <T_0> philosop@@ her@@ s do .
<T_3> no one would <T_0> that the <T_1> was without <T_2> on the <T_5> of one glass of <T_4> .
<T_3> the <T_0> follo@@ wing , the other stories <T_2> heard about the <T_4> growing up were no more <T_1> .
<T_2> i <T_0> &apos;t put in an electro@@ de <T_1> say , &quot; go <T_3> . &quot;
i talk to <T_1> mother once in a <T_2> moon on the <T_0> .
to <T_0> would be <T_1> .
<T_2> is , <T_1> course , <T_5> just about <T_3> , <T_4> &apos;s also <T_0> ima@@ gery .
and when i was <T_1> pe@@ ar@@ l di@@ vers , i <T_2> the world <T_0> fre@@ e-@@ di@@ ving .
as <T_6> as i realized <T_0> , i investig@@ ated <T_8> underlying relationship <T_3> four pre@@ valent air pollu@@ tan@@ ts <T_7> their <T_5> on <T_1> lung health <T_2> as@@ th@@ matic <T_4> .
<T_2> all happened to be <T_3> on <T_0> spon@@ taneously , by <T_1> of <T_4> .
<T_2> will happen to <T_0> that <T_3> top@@ -@@ hea@@ vy with <T_1> people ?
so i sc@@ ra@@ ped <T_2> sli@@ me <T_0> and i sent <T_1> off to <T_3> .
<T_0> where , you know , a factor of 10 <T_3> can make <T_1> factor of 1,000 difference in <T_2> out@@ come .
<T_6> &apos;re <T_2> to thinking of themselves <T_3> provi@@ ders , <T_5> they <T_4> &apos;t seem to build the social <T_0> that allow them to get <T_1> college .
and <T_1> colors here repres@@ ent <T_0> motivation <T_3> the <T_2> .
look at <T_4> the argu@@ ments we have <T_6> days over health care , over <T_0> and <T_5> on wall <T_1> , over the <T_9> between rich <T_2> poor , over <T_8> action <T_7> sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex <T_3> .
&quot; will <T_1> help <T_0> their <T_2> ? &quot;
and we <T_0> ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate them together <T_2> make literally thousands <T_8> thousands of <T_7> big nan@@ o-@@ molecular molecules the <T_3> size <T_9> dna <T_4> proteins , but <T_6> &apos;s <T_5> carbon in <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> kind of engagement you <T_0> to have <T_1> .
they <T_1> enough <T_2> for three <T_0> .
<T_3> i &apos;m <T_5> my dea@@ th@@ bed , <T_1> &apos;m going to <T_4> one story <T_0> than any <T_2> .
the second <T_5> i was at had big <T_8> too , <T_7> a <T_6> tu@@ li@@ p tree , i <T_0> it was the <T_9> in the country , and <T_4> also had a lot of wonderful <T_2> and <T_3> around it , around the playing <T_1> .
i brought <T_1> for <T_0> parents .
<T_0> work <T_5> evolved from <T_2> concern@@ ed main@@ ly <T_3> war <T_1> a <T_4> on critical <T_6> issues as well .
<T_1> turned <T_4> that <T_0> wasn &apos;t , <T_5> it really is <T_3> system of motivation , a <T_6> of <T_2> .
<T_2> so one of <T_1> tools that we can use <T_4> sa@@ mp@@ le <T_0> oceans <T_3> ac@@ ou@@ stics , or <T_5> .
i believe in the <T_3> of <T_2> ra@@ ja yo@@ g@@ i : be <T_0> du@@ de before <T_4> can become an <T_1> .
<T_1> this is <T_2> project . <T_0> &apos;s how it <T_3> .
really <T_0> we <T_2> to hear <T_1> music .
well , it &apos;s <T_5> theory that tries <T_9> answer the question : <T_6> are <T_3> basic , <T_7> , <T_8> , un@@ cu@@ tt@@ able <T_4> making up <T_2> in <T_0> world around <T_1> ?
<T_3> so you <T_2> to <T_0> with it . <T_4> have <T_1> focus on it .
the other thing <T_2> i think <T_1> really important : <T_3> lot <T_9> national <T_7> policy isn &apos;t just <T_4> foreign policy , <T_0> it &apos;s <T_6> budgets , military budgets , and <T_5> the <T_8> of countries work out .
&quot; <T_0> don &apos;t speak <T_1> ? &quot;
and i <T_2> love <T_5> and <T_7> &apos;m <T_8> in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive <T_3> i <T_4> taking on , you know , the <T_1> qu@@ o and trying <T_6> turn it <T_0> down .
and <T_3> began <T_2> life@@ -@@ long <T_0> for writing <T_1> .
well , <T_2> dream of becoming a <T_0> will <T_1> come to <T_3> .
<T_4> a leader <T_5> , &quot; not <T_3> my <T_2> , &quot; everything <T_1> to <T_0> .
<T_2> think there &apos;s an obvious <T_0> that i <T_1> you &apos;re <T_3> about .
he <T_0> &apos;t know .
<T_2> vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous <T_1> covered in <T_0> diam@@ on@@ ds .
but that &apos;s too <T_4> for <T_5> , so i &apos;ll <T_7> it <T_6> you , <T_3> i give <T_2> one average <T_0> for each <T_1> .
<T_1> that &apos;s what <T_0> did .
&quot; everybody gets <T_5> fran@@ tic about <T_2> , <T_1> you &apos;re <T_0> allowed to say these things , yet when you <T_4> at it ra@@ tionally , there is no reason why <T_6> ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to <T_7> as any other , except that we &apos;ve <T_9> somehow between us <T_8> they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; <T_3> that &apos;s the end of the quote from dou@@ glas .
and <T_4> distribution <T_5> japanese <T_0> totally different , where we see a group of inter@@ medi@@ ate <T_1> , which is <T_3> as the <T_2> &quot; r. &quot;
<T_0> fol@@ k sing@@ ers <T_3> at <T_2> at a gender <T_1> program .
wor@@ k-@@ life <T_4> , <T_6> ni@@ gel mar@@ sh , is too <T_1> to be left <T_0> the hands of <T_3> emplo@@ yer . mar@@ sh la@@ ys out an <T_2> day bal@@ an@@ ced between family time , personal time and produ@@ ctivity -- <T_5> off@@ ers <T_8> stir@@ ring encoura@@ gement <T_7> make it happen . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so de@@ ar@@ th of data <T_0> the debate <T_2> one <T_1> .
so , for example , there is the <T_0> of no@@ ora .
now the first <T_4> , <T_0> first <T_1> , is <T_2> easy -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> easy at all -- <T_7> it is something that <T_6> been appro@@ ached <T_8> in neuro@@ science .
<T_2> there <T_1> another <T_3> , there is a <T_0> couple .
<T_5> is a klein bottle wine bottle , which , although <T_2> four dimensions it <T_6> &apos;t <T_0> able to hold any <T_9> at all , it &apos;s perfectly <T_3> of <T_7> so <T_1> our <T_8> has only three <T_4> .
so even though we love <T_6> as an <T_4> , we very much <T_2> it &apos;s a <T_9> too , and <T_3> if <T_0> do our jobs right <T_7> get a little <T_8> , that <T_1> art can be <T_5> business .
for some , <T_3> will lead to <T_0> , <T_4> and <T_1> violence and <T_2> .
<T_0> is something to be <T_1> out <T_4> small <T_2> , you know -- <T_5> little <T_3> , h@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
but <T_0> i look <T_3> the future , the <T_1> project is <T_2> unknown and <T_4> open .
so what we &apos;re going to do is take an <T_5> c@@ arti@@ lage from a young , <T_7> pig , <T_9> it of its anti@@ gens , lo@@ ad it with <T_4> stem cells , then put <T_2> back on to that arth@@ ri@@ tic surface in your <T_6> , t@@ ack <T_1> on there , have you he@@ al that surface and <T_8> create a new <T_0> surface for your <T_3> .
<T_2> : i also believe that <T_4> a <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> important , so <T_5> the time the <T_1> were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , i go on ho@@ li@@ day with them .
these <T_3> blue <T_2> are the fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings -- <T_5> do this <T_4> every mar@@ ch -- <T_7> means that they &apos;re only <T_6> the <T_0> from janu@@ ary <T_8> mar@@ ch , <T_9> maybe <T_1> months at the most that they could get covered in oil .
understanding <T_5> of this en@@ ables <T_2> to <T_3> our per@@ ception <T_0> se@@ af@@ o@@ od <T_4> from <T_1> com@@ modi@@ ty to <T_6> opportunity to restore our <T_7> .
<T_5> result was that <T_7> found stuck outside my office <T_2> huge <T_1> of people , <T_4> is actually a photograph taken in li@@ b@@ ya but i saw the <T_0> scene in iraq of people standing outside scre@@ am@@ ing for the elec@@ tions , <T_9> when i <T_6> out and said , &quot; <T_3> is wrong with the inter@@ im pro@@ vin@@ cial <T_8> ?
now there <T_0> a lot of <T_1> for that .
this <T_4> finding <T_0> and <T_5> ground <T_8> your ene@@ mi@@ es thing <T_3> kind of like a poli@@ tic@@ al-@@ spiritual <T_7> for <T_6> , and i <T_1> &apos;t the <T_2> lam@@ a .
<T_2> &apos;s amazing <T_1> these <T_0> beat at all .
&quot; <T_2> the name <T_3> father <T_1> , <T_4> me offer you <T_0> food . &quot;
<T_5> technology <T_2> also be <T_3> to <T_1> world appli@@ cations -- in this <T_4> , a smart <T_0> .
<T_0> grab@@ bed <T_2> pen , he <T_1> his sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s .
given the <T_7> , the <T_6> clearly <T_0> for us to act based on the prec@@ au@@ tion@@ ary principle -- <T_2> theory that holds <T_8> when human health <T_1> the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential <T_3> is irre@@ versi@@ ble , <T_4> cannot afford to wait <T_9> <T_5> scientific certain@@ ty .
<T_2> meas@@ uring <T_9> student <T_3> , researchers were able <T_7> predict how <T_0> and long-@@ la@@ sting a subject &apos;s marriage will be , how <T_4> she would score on <T_6> tests of well-@@ being <T_1> how <T_8> she would be <T_5> others .
<T_0> sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh : <T_1> you play <T_2> gro@@ om@@ ing song ?
that &apos;s a long way <T_1> fall , <T_3> you get it <T_0> . <T_2> was just about <T_4> .
according to <T_0> center for <T_2> control , fully one <T_3> of all <T_5> born <T_1> 2000 will get <T_4> .
<T_0> you didn &apos;t know that .
<T_1> i say no <T_3> away , <T_6> some <T_7> them come with <T_0> and they <T_5> well-@@ inten@@ tioned <T_2> they get you for <T_4> least one <T_8> two meetings .
you know ?
and what <T_6> notic@@ ed was <T_8> don &apos;t have a <T_3> of dv@@ rs , they don &apos;t have a <T_0> of micro@@ waves , but <T_9> seem to do <T_5> pretty good <T_4> of <T_2> their <T_7> on <T_1> road .
so <T_0> stra@@ ined it <T_2> the ed@@ ges , <T_1> we held it by <T_3> .
<T_3> during <T_0> time , i <T_6> that <T_5> was about <T_7> and developing them on the local <T_2> that really was going <T_1> do the right thing <T_8> our <T_4> .
and let &apos;s <T_2> at the <T_1> , <T_0> the ma@@ cro@@ -@@ fac@@ tors .
<T_4> even at this <T_6> , i started <T_3> move away from <T_2> need to <T_5> human@@ -@@ ness <T_7> the <T_0> aes@@ thetic <T_1> .
<T_2> really can <T_1> a <T_0> with it .
<T_1> that &apos;s what <T_0> do to <T_3> traffic <T_2> .
with a fli@@ p of <T_3> switch you create <T_0> bubble <T_1> you within which gps signals can &apos;t <T_2> .
<T_3> is <T_0> than <T_1> think . it <T_2> is .
here &apos;s an example from a <T_0> of con@@ tex@@ ts .
effectively , <T_4> taliban create a <T_1> bl@@ ack@@ out of <T_2> other source of information <T_3> these <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ve got money <T_0> the <T_3> . <T_4> &apos;s because you get the <T_2> people .
<T_3> , not an <T_0> dose , <T_1> an illegal dose , <T_2> very much <T_4> the <T_5> end of <T_6> .
<T_0> comes <T_3> the <T_1> word that <T_4> en@@ li@@ ven -- to <T_2> , to bring to life .
one needs <T_1> build in much more <T_4> practice questions , and one also <T_5> to provide <T_2> students with <T_3> on <T_0> questions .
<T_2> , <T_0> can <T_1> time .
<T_1> believed <T_2> photogra@@ pher@@ s , and so did <T_0> of other <T_3> .

&quot; <T_1> , &quot; <T_3> thought , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> first world country , let &apos;s see what <T_0> can do . &quot;
<T_1> project a@@ im <T_0> really quite <T_2> .
it &apos;s going to be <T_1> . <T_2> say <T_6> give <T_7> a shot anyway <T_4> we &apos;ve <T_5> come <T_3> far to <T_8> it up <T_0> .
journalist <T_5> gl@@ en@@ ny <T_1> several <T_9> in a coura@@ geous investig@@ ation of organi@@ zed crime networks worldwide , <T_3> have gro@@ wn to an <T_0> 15 % of the <T_2> economy . from the rus@@ si@@ an <T_8> , to giant drug <T_4> , his sour@@ ces inclu@@ de <T_7> just intelligence and law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement offici@@ als but <T_6> insi@@ ders .
<T_2> question : <T_6> you can &apos;t <T_3> and <T_1> , <T_5> do you <T_4> your <T_0> information ?
and <T_2> said , &quot; <T_9> genetic <T_7> , &quot; -- and <T_8> &apos;ll never <T_5> the words -- &quot; stands <T_0> us and <T_3> star@@ vation on <T_1> scale <T_4> cannot <T_6> . &quot;
<T_6> here &apos;s a <T_4> mathematical fact -- <T_3> you &apos;ve got <T_0> numbers , one <T_5> three <T_1> must <T_2> true .

not <T_8> lot of <T_7> diseases <T_5> that <T_3> . and you can <T_6> here -- <T_2> is a graph of <T_1> rates by <T_4> in <T_0> and egyp@@ t .
<T_1> they could do <T_2> they <T_0> to to this <T_3> .
<T_2> it <T_1> con@@ temp@@ late the va@@ st@@ ness <T_0> inter@@ stell@@ ar <T_3> .
i &apos;ve put a bunch of examples up here .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_0> to <T_2> they &apos;re <T_1> , you <T_3> .
the <T_0> , <T_1> , is <T_2> world &apos;s free time and tal@@ ents .
and <T_2> , <T_4> talked to friends <T_1> china <T_0> chinese <T_3> .
the last thing that &apos;s remarkable about <T_6> tarahumara <T_0> that all the things <T_3> we &apos;re going to be talking about <T_8> , all the things that <T_7> &apos;re trying to come up with using <T_5> of our technology and <T_2> power to solve -- things like heart <T_4> and cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and cancer and crime and <T_1> and violence and clinical <T_9> -- all this stuff , the tarahumara don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
<T_3> finally , my son <T_2> in <T_1> walking <T_0> by himself .
<T_1> has <T_0> diam@@ on@@ d-@@ bot@@ tom@@ ed lake .
la@@ dies <T_6> gentle@@ men of the <T_3> east , here &apos;s a <T_2> issue . <T_8> we see <T_1> other , when <T_4> say <T_0> , how <T_7> k@@ is@@ ses are <T_5> going to do ?
<T_3> really would <T_1> de@@ di@@ cated to <T_0> arts <T_2> to inter@@ acting .
<T_4> main <T_3> is an underwater video <T_5> a hydro@@ phone , which is an underwater micro@@ phone , and this <T_6> so i <T_0> cor@@ rel@@ ate <T_2> and <T_1> .
so , what <T_8> want to tell you , very <T_7> , is a <T_6> examples of the exc@@ it@@ ement <T_3> what <T_5> can do today at the center <T_0> the galaxy , now that <T_1> know that there is , or at <T_2> we believe , <T_9> there is a <T_4> black hole there .
but then <T_1> next generation of planes <T_2> about <T_0> .
but <T_4> of the <T_0> things <T_2> needed to do was <T_3> what i <T_1> right away .
after a natural dis@@ aster stri@@ kes , there &apos;s only a tiny <T_6> of opportunity <T_8> r@@ ally <T_2> re@@ co@@ very eff@@ or@@ ts before <T_1> world turns their <T_3> el@@ se@@ where . who should be in <T_5> ? when a fre@@ ak <T_0> hit their home@@ town , si@@ sters ca@@ it@@ ria and <T_4> o &apos;@@ nei@@ ll -- just <T_7> and 24 at the time -- took the r@@ eins and are <T_9> teaching others how to do the same .
and <T_2> experienced this most <T_0> when i <T_4> to <T_5> villa@@ ges <T_1> study <T_3> .
and <T_3> one that particularly bo@@ ther@@ ed me <T_0> the bur@@ n department <T_4> the process by which <T_1> nur@@ ses took the <T_2> .
because what i <T_1> to see then was there were <T_0> many <T_4> ways <T_3> would <T_2> this .
and <T_2> then can re-@@ per@@ fu@@ se <T_1> li@@ ver <T_0> cells , <T_4> the blood <T_3> tree .
<T_4> &apos;d <T_1> love to be put in front of <T_3> of the most amazing <T_0> and <T_2> in america . &quot;
when you &apos;re <T_3> your bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry <T_6> and@@ ro@@ id <T_8> <T_1> , don &apos;t bo@@ ther <T_0> la@@ you@@ ts <T_2> the pun@@ ctu@@ ation <T_7> to hit <T_4> period and then a <T_9> and then try to cap@@ itali@@ ze <T_5> next le@@ tter .
but if you look <T_4> africa , <T_0> is a compon@@ ent of <T_1> genetic <T_2> that has <T_3> close <T_5> outside .
<T_8> is a symbol <T_6> what we <T_0> achieve when we <T_9> in <T_1> impossible , when we have a team , <T_4> we have pione@@ ering <T_5> , and <T_2> when <T_7> understand that all the <T_3> we have should be thro@@ wn over@@ board .
<T_4> of you guys <T_1> paul <T_2> , <T_3> greatest <T_0> designer -- i &apos;m sorry -- out there .
<T_0> are <T_1> missing ?
on top of <T_2> , those <T_0> the places from <T_3> trouble <T_1> .

<T_2> for@@ got about the <T_1> chain around <T_0> .
and so <T_4> idea <T_2> , you know , how would <T_0> put together the <T_5> in a <T_1> simple <T_3> ?
<T_3> should see <T_1> circles -- <T_0> are called <T_2> .
heard <T_0> it , at least ? you <T_1> hear about <T_3> these <T_2> .
<T_0> we <T_2> that <T_1> a couple of reasons .
<T_5> these are <T_0> of the <T_2> i <T_1> in mind a <T_3> years ago when <T_6> sat down <T_7> write <T_4> book .
and there <T_5> some <T_6> to this , in <T_2> sense <T_7> we <T_0> something <T_8> a <T_3> resour@@ ce , and <T_9> growth is <T_1> to push up <T_4> for that .
this is <T_8> of the <T_1> where <T_3> believe there is a <T_0> prob@@ ability of the <T_7> of <T_6> first life <T_4> earth in the ocean that exists <T_5> <T_2> .
<T_7> resear@@ cher <T_1> de grey argu@@ es that <T_2> is mer@@ ely <T_4> disease -- <T_8> a <T_3> one at that . humans age in <T_5> basic ways , he <T_6> , <T_9> of which can be <T_0> .
<T_0> it <T_4> re@@ f@@ ers <T_2> this <T_5> , gal@@ va@@ o <T_3> , who &apos;s the lead <T_6> comm@@ ent@@ ator for <T_1> glob@@ o .
see , it &apos;s one of <T_1> great <T_4> of my <T_2> un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x <T_8> that <T_3> wasn &apos;t ever <T_7> to <T_0> myself as any one thing <T_6> any <T_5> .
<T_0> enorm@@ ously <T_1> mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions here .
<T_0> is@@ lands rise <T_2> one <T_1> two meters above the <T_3> .
our <T_0> type of error is <T_1> fal@@ se <T_2> .
<T_8> , <T_3> we put <T_2> into <T_0> core <T_1> , <T_5> know that <T_4> aren &apos;t the <T_7> systems with integri@@ ty <T_6> money will be well spent .
and <T_4> it , <T_2> in the middle of <T_1> tor@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ al shape , <T_7> shape , <T_5> in the <T_3> is <T_0> million <T_6> .
<T_3> instead of using a <T_2> percent <T_1> , i &apos;m going to reduce it to <T_0> percent .
<T_4> it &apos;s <T_0> scot@@ ts@@ d@@ ale , <T_1> , <T_3> it &apos;s called &quot; flo@@ ating <T_2> . &quot;
these <T_1> robert &apos;s m@@ ris , <T_0> , under <T_2> tt@@ field treatment .
<T_2> where is <T_0> cell <T_1> really going ?
and <T_1> answer <T_3> , <T_2> , we can , and <T_0> did .
but you <T_3> , we <T_2> , <T_0> need <T_4> air@@ time for <T_1> ideas .
<T_8> i <T_7> that the <T_4> is , we can look <T_1> mortality <T_0> , <T_3> we <T_6> use mortality <T_9> to figure out what <T_2> pre@@ val@@ ence was in <T_5> past .
but <T_5> one <T_4> of the people <T_0> them , <T_2> they are <T_1> they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or <T_6> .
<T_2> &apos;re curi@@ ous , and <T_3> just go out and get <T_0> , you <T_1> ?
and i think it &apos;s <T_0> in <T_1> di@@ ver@@ gent <T_2> that <T_3> most <T_4> pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness .
somewhere <T_2> stream <T_0> a <T_1> is running through here .
so in <T_4> case , i thought , well , <T_1> data and <T_3> algorith@@ m lead <T_2> to <T_5> prin@@ ce <T_0> ?
michael <T_0> i were <T_1> way at the side of the kitchen .
let &apos;s get off <T_4> fan@@ ni@@ es , <T_3> up our <T_5> and get <T_0> work , <T_6> , in <T_2> an almost <T_1> world .
and , you know , it &apos;s like -- <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> important <T_0> have like role models out there .
and it is <T_1> that region <T_6> i &apos;m going <T_3> high@@ light now that we have <T_2> hou@@ sing of <T_0> the life@@ -@@ regu@@ lation <T_4> of the <T_5> .
this went down very well <T_1> the u.k. , <T_0> religion is <T_2> un@@ popular .
so when <T_0> get really <T_4> about all of <T_2> , i <T_5> myself in thinking <T_3> the <T_1> revolution .
we also atta@@ ch a dis@@ crete shor@@ t-@@ range communication radio , and the <T_1> talk <T_0> each other .
what <T_2> see here <T_3> a <T_1> in india , and she &apos;s speaking kor@@ o , <T_5> is <T_4> new@@ ly <T_0> language .
so i <T_0> them .
<T_3> &apos;s re@@ brand <T_0> warming , as many <T_1> you have <T_2> .
but <T_2> are <T_3> when we are <T_1> partici@@ pan@@ ts in <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_0> sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .
<T_0> the mon@@ ster <T_2> you , the mon@@ ster &apos;s gon@@ na get <T_1> .
so this <T_0> telling us <T_1> the fer@@ ment@@ ation is <T_2> full <T_3> .
<T_2> won &apos;t talk <T_3> about <T_0> the <T_1> system .
<T_2> you <T_1> to have more <T_0> .
<T_4> there &apos;s <T_6> that end up <T_7> a <T_3> , and as <T_0> as they meet the <T_5> of the <T_2> agency , there <T_8> be all <T_1> of things in there , no <T_9> .
<T_2> i <T_0> , &quot; let me <T_1> you something . &quot;
<T_2> they have <T_3> cities , and <T_0> cities are <T_1> depen@@ dent on <T_4> .
we &apos;re <T_2> free <T_3> , <T_4> we let <T_0> and all <T_5> things -- we <T_1> them off .
i <T_8> &apos;t walk , i couldn &apos;t <T_3> , i <T_6> &apos;t <T_9> , i couldn &apos;t move , i certainly couldn &apos;t sing , <T_2> couldn &apos;t <T_4> brea@@ the , but when i looked <T_0> and i saw my <T_5> , i <T_7> &apos;t help <T_1> s@@ mile .
so <T_1> do you go <T_0> sex ?
the <T_0> requ@@ ir@@ es <T_1> .
<T_2> had <T_4> about <T_3> electro@@ mechan@@ ical efficiency <T_1> then we can calculate the <T_0> efficiency .
<T_4> audience <T_0> anyone who is here to <T_2> , <T_3> those who are <T_1> familiar <T_5> classi@@ cal music .
<T_1> univers@@ ality , to <T_4> , <T_2> us -- that we <T_3> the <T_0> .
<T_1> then the most <T_0> thing happens over time .
<T_6> like to think that <T_1> do a th@@ or@@ ough physical <T_7> , but because <T_2> whole visit <T_0> now about <T_3> physical , i could <T_5> an extra@@ ordin@@ arily th@@ or@@ ough <T_4> .
so we <T_3> for <T_4> universal <T_0> ; <T_2> thought there would be <T_1> out there .
they <T_0> one look <T_2> the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ine <T_3> tasman@@ ia , and they <T_5> , hang on , <T_1> is <T_4> going to work .
i <T_4> &apos;t <T_5> lo@@ u <T_0> to be here , <T_1> this is <T_2> building <T_3> did for <T_6> in 196@@ 4 , i think .
so <T_1> and <T_0> forces <T_4> nature <T_3> are put together under the <T_2> of vi@@ br@@ ating <T_5> .
<T_2> : i think we have discovered <T_7> very important <T_1> in <T_4> arab <T_0> -- that <T_3> care , people <T_6> about <T_8> great <T_5> .
<T_0> zim@@ bar@@ do : the <T_2> of <T_1> ?
one <T_0> the challenges <T_3> that <T_1> ri@@ cher <T_4> are , the <T_2> we live .
in fact , i &apos;ve got 3@@ 8@@ ,000 of <T_1> now and <T_2> kind@@ le <T_0> sight .
<T_1> &apos;ve got a cool <T_3> to <T_0> in <T_4> a <T_2> .
<T_2> : <T_1> want to speak <T_0> english .
<T_2> it <T_0> this is another <T_1> coming down there , you know .
<T_4> actually take the <T_3> , we use very <T_5> deter@@ g@@ ents , and we , by using these <T_6> deter@@ g@@ ents , <T_2> take all the cells <T_0> of the <T_1> .
and a <T_6> after we got the pau@@ ling <T_4> -- <T_5> should <T_7> i took <T_2> manus@@ cri@@ pt <T_1> london , <T_3> showed the <T_0> .
<T_1> united states actually is a country <T_2> is <T_0> reser@@ ve cur@@ ren@@ cy of the <T_3> .
they <T_6> a group <T_2> their <T_4> scientists to investig@@ ate , and what they <T_1> was <T_7> all these <T_5> drives were <T_3> near <T_0> du@@ cts .
and <T_2> &apos;m sure <T_3> ful@@ ler <T_1> be very , <T_4> proud <T_0> see a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o <T_5> dom@@ e .
<T_6> , <T_2> believe <T_7> in@@ vention of the <T_5> internet is <T_3> in@@ ev@@ itable con@@ sequence <T_0> a pre@@ vi@@ ously <T_4> , biologi@@ cally <T_1> model .
but <T_1> is <T_3> with <T_2> extremely strong and <T_0> state .
so , he had <T_0> brilliant <T_1> .
<T_1> &quot; <T_0> , <T_2> . &quot;
<T_0> they &apos;ll be <T_2> same as the symmetries of the tri@@ angle , or the symmetries of <T_1> six-@@ poin@@ ted <T_3> .
they were creating <T_1> either <T_7> large far@@ ms , or they <T_2> giving <T_5> to the <T_0> that <T_9> thought they <T_8> use , rather <T_6> that <T_3> farmers <T_4> to use .
<T_1> stimu@@ lation . <T_0> .
and <T_2> i put some ultravio@@ let <T_4> on my <T_5> and took a <T_6> , <T_7> long ex@@ pos@@ ure with the <T_0> frequ@@ en@@ cies of <T_3> light and <T_1> is what i got .
<T_2> &apos;ve discovered these <T_0> , <T_1> , in v-day world , we call vagina <T_3> .
so we built <T_0> first <T_2> college in <T_1> .
<T_6> is <T_0> ten@@ den@@ cy to in@@ fu@@ se patterns with <T_3> , <T_4> and <T_1> , often <T_2> beings <T_5> the top down .
but <T_3> is <T_1> nice , s@@ len@@ der , <T_2> bad <T_0> .
and <T_2> guy just told <T_0> , &quot; there &apos;s no way . this grandmother won &apos;t even -- you know , there &apos;s no way she &apos;s ever going to let you <T_1> this girl that &apos;s she &apos;s raising . &quot;
it <T_0> &quot; <T_1> oni@@ on for <T_2> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;re <T_0> ready <T_2> what &apos;s coming at us .
<T_0> , look <T_1> it <T_2> there .
<T_0> didn &apos;t know what was <T_1> , what was <T_2> .
now , this <T_1> picture <T_0> a thou@@ ght-@@ balloon , <T_2> thou@@ ght-@@ bubble .
<T_0> &apos;s as <T_4> we &apos;re using <T_5> as <T_3> parts to support <T_1> fra@@ gi@@ le sense <T_2> self .
action .
our <T_2> have <T_1> in <T_0> last 10,000 <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;t that <T_0> ?
<T_1> our ability <T_2> imagine is what <T_0> us explor@@ ers .
well , <T_1> last <T_2> , very <T_0> .
<T_1> said , &quot; <T_4> know <T_3> i kind of <T_2> medi@@ tation , and i <T_0> . &quot;
the western <T_8> of the bor@@ e@@ al in <T_4> columbia <T_6> mar@@ ked by the coast mountains , and on the other side of those <T_1> is <T_9> greatest <T_0> temper@@ ate rain@@ forest in the world , <T_3> great <T_5> rain@@ forest , and we &apos;ll <T_7> that in a <T_2> minutes in a bit more detail .
<T_2> a fe@@ ar@@ less <T_0> determin@@ ed heart will get the <T_1> me@@ d@@ al .
so <T_1> me reas@@ sure <T_0> about something .
<T_1> they <T_0> around , and they <T_2> about dreams .
<T_2> years from now , this is what <T_6> hope <T_7> to me : <T_4> &apos;m taken back <T_3> the <T_8> , i &apos;m given <T_5> gas mas@@ k : 80 <T_1> per million <T_0> .
you know <T_3> ? six of <T_5> seven <T_2> in <T_1> the bill , so it <T_4> , and it passed <T_0> a vote of <T_6> to 3@@ 2 <T_7>
<T_2> never like , &quot; <T_1> ha <T_0> ha ha <T_3> ha . <T_4>
<T_2> gar@@ re@@ t : what <T_0> deter@@ mine the <T_1> of a pande@@ mic , <T_3> don &apos;t really know .
<T_0> other <T_1> -- -- <T_3> , perhaps , en@@ ri@@ co fer@@ m@@ i <T_4> was an <T_2> .
<T_3> the way to do that <T_2> to <T_1> , <T_4> to say i &apos;m not <T_5> in <T_0> continent because there &apos;s too much corruption .
what <T_6> said was <T_2> like this : <T_1> you <T_0> creatures that v@@ ary , and that can &apos;t be <T_7> -- i &apos;ve been <T_9> the <T_8> , and i &apos;ve measu@@ red <T_3> size of the <T_5> and the size of the <T_4> sh@@ ells and so on , and so on .
so , with the <T_4> media lab , <T_2> quite a while now , <T_0> &apos;ve been <T_3> in <T_5> field <T_6> active <T_1> .
i pull in . i put the <T_0> in <T_1> .
so , starting <T_0> steel : <T_2> do you make <T_1> ?
g-@@ h@@ -@@ e-@@ z <T_3> , so@@ 2 <T_1> already been <T_4> , actually , in <T_2> mathematical language . so <T_0> can &apos;t have that one .
but <T_6> some <T_0> , we could change the <T_4> and <T_1> of the environment <T_3> we <T_2> with <T_7> place <T_5> .
and <T_3> was really <T_1> for <T_2> , but <T_0> .
it <T_0> gravit@@ ational waves .
he <T_2> . he <T_3> to make <T_1> way <T_0> me .
<T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> now .
<T_7> and <T_2> , <T_1> to the <T_3> , looking for the <T_4> , looking <T_0> the <T_6> to fill in that <T_5> .
yet <T_1> &apos;ve <T_2> created the <T_0> for im@@ pulse <T_3> .
<T_0> if <T_1> don &apos;t do that , <T_5> you allow for <T_2> accident to keep on <T_3> , <T_7> have the <T_8> of getting <T_6> a <T_4> .
and <T_9> know what &apos;s <T_4> ? you <T_0> &apos;t <T_5> it , <T_3> there are countries in <T_1> the most attra@@ ctive <T_8> to be is not <T_2> shop@@ ping center <T_7> the <T_6> .
&quot; should <T_1> be <T_0> ?
but <T_3> you see any <T_1> in <T_2> fact <T_5> , in <T_8> for you to shine <T_4> light , <T_7> have to , yourself , create <T_0> around <T_6> sour@@ ces ?
<T_2> once <T_7> path <T_0> constru@@ cted , it &apos;ll connect <T_1> south bronx with <T_5> than <T_6> ac@@ res <T_3> rand@@ all &apos;s island <T_4> .
technology in x-ray where <T_7> &apos;s life@@ -@@ size process@@ ed , apart from these <T_9> car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough <T_4> the quality of the <T_2> and the <T_0> to be good enough for <T_5> i want <T_8> do <T_3> it , which <T_6> show my pictures <T_1> .
so <T_3> work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ located <T_2> dist@@ ant and <T_0> , <T_4> always <T_1> .
<T_0> think there <T_3> really something in that artic@@ u@@ lation <T_2> is <T_1> nice .
we know <T_0> &apos;ll do <T_4> next <T_1> , <T_2> today let us go and <T_3> .
but you <T_0> see those spi@@ kes , and they &apos;re there .
so in one of <T_5> experiments , we <T_2> people to name a <T_0> person <T_1> they <T_6> , <T_4> living <T_7> they <T_3> .
here <T_1> the <T_2> challenge we face in <T_0> .
so <T_0> &apos;ve been working on this <T_3> little , also , <T_2> a couple of <T_1> guys .
and <T_1> &apos;m <T_0> to show you <T_2> .
<T_3> , <T_2> the individuals are only aware of <T_1> near@@ est <T_0> .
&quot; it <T_1> &apos;t <T_3> me . <T_4> ? what ? <T_2> something <T_0> with him ? &quot;
well , they &apos;re looking at cele@@ sti@@ al <T_1> in the sky , <T_3> of <T_2> you and i <T_0> &apos;t see .
<T_0> many <T_2> will <T_1> get ?
<T_0> you have <T_1> than <T_5> percent of the shares <T_3> a <T_6> , you <T_7> control , <T_9> usually <T_4> depen@@ ds on the rela@@ tive <T_2> of <T_8> .
<T_4> i wa@@ ited , <T_5> the next <T_6> i liked <T_0> a bit <T_7> , the next <T_3> i liked it a bit <T_2> , and <T_8> i really love <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_3> easier now than <T_2> before to make a <T_0> living .
and <T_1> problem , of <T_3> , with all of <T_0> is that with all those <T_7> forms — <T_5> i &apos;m <T_4> you we <T_6> paper forms for <T_2> possible thing .
what <T_0> its <T_1> ? 20,000 dollars .
of <T_1> there &apos;s <T_2> a lot of old <T_0> out there <T_3> .
but i <T_2> that my hus@@ band &apos;s family looks forward <T_3> the <T_5> when <T_8> can ritu@@ ally <T_9> what <T_0> remarkable <T_1> has <T_7> to their lives , when they can ritu@@ ally re@@ count his life &apos;s narra@@ tive , wea@@ ving his <T_4> into <T_6> history of their community .
<T_0> could <T_2> percent survive on <T_1> percent ?
<T_0> , <T_1> fact , are <T_2> en@@ danger@@ ed species themselves .
<T_2> , that &apos;s <T_3> process there . deu@@ teri@@ um <T_0> tri@@ ti@@ um goes together makes helium <T_1> .
and if you &apos;re among <T_0> people <T_1> create the <T_3> , <T_2> is <T_4> .
we have <T_1> at least <T_0> systems here , and they both are very ancient .
so <T_0> started to wonder , you know , <T_4> , so you have <T_8> people coming <T_2> like this , and <T_9> &apos;re particip@@ ating . is it possible that we <T_1> get people <T_6> fa@@ ke <T_5> and <T_7> it lead them to <T_3> more ?
<T_5> ch@@ unk <T_0> rock six miles <T_6> , moving something like 50 <T_1> the speed of <T_2> bul@@ let , s@@ lam@@ med into <T_3> earth <T_4>
<T_4> &apos;s the part of <T_6> that ye@@ ar@@ ns <T_2> god , <T_0> something <T_5> than <T_1> find in <T_3> .
<T_2> years <T_3> in the <T_4> so@@ vi@@ et union , a team <T_5> engineers was <T_6> moving a <T_0> object through a <T_1> coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and <T_0> of this , we really decided we <T_1> some more sophi@@ st@@ icated <T_2> .
<T_5> biggest <T_1> with the home is <T_0> used to be <T_2> heart of <T_6> on <T_4> , food <T_7> , what made our <T_3> .
<T_3> , <T_8> thing that kind of ties the <T_0> of <T_4> to cancer <T_6> to <T_9> cancer as <T_7> re@@ pair <T_5> gone out of control in the body -- is that <T_2> has a <T_1> in it called &quot; m@@ yo@@ d . &quot;
you have a <T_0> high , you <T_2> status <T_1> .
ted@@ x .
<T_2> do <T_4> r@@ ank three <T_1> ago in <T_3> report <T_0> the o@@ ec@@ d ?
<T_2> econom@@ ist <T_3> an <T_0> about it , and lots of <T_4> have <T_5> about it -- <T_1> fru@@ stration .
<T_4> &apos;s just <T_1> well , because it <T_3> stay <T_0> it <T_2> .
now , mu@@ mit@@ a was a <T_3> one to <T_1> . <T_2> is <T_0> destro@@ yer .
<T_5> &apos;ve got that gene <T_4> in them as well , and <T_2> want <T_6> to <T_1> , <T_3> than anything <T_0> .
<T_5> i <T_2> is <T_0> co@@ w about to eat something <T_4> . <T_3> is <T_1> co@@ w eating ?
so therefore , we have these <T_6> met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ ms , <T_8> i <T_7> with <T_5> ger@@ man <T_1> , michael <T_2> , <T_4> we &apos;ve identifi@@ ed <T_0> two <T_3> met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ ms .
and <T_0> &apos;ve got to use <T_5> from <T_3> rain@@ forests <T_6> show <T_4> forests are <T_7> more as <T_2> than they are as <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_9> fan@@ cy <T_6> of saying it &apos;s got <T_5> , <T_3> , <T_8> , <T_7> -- things go <T_0> and out of it . <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> .
in fact we <T_9> in the stimul@@ us <T_3> -- <T_5> &apos;s <T_1> -- <T_4> house version <T_8> had money in it <T_6> these data systems , and it <T_0> taken out in the <T_2> because there are people who <T_7> thre@@ at@@ ened by these things .
so this <T_1> some work <T_0> we &apos;re <T_2> .
<T_6> never really <T_3> it <T_5> quali@@ fy it <T_7> quanti@@ fy it , <T_2> say , &quot; <T_1> is <T_4> i <T_0> in .
<T_1> first is that problems <T_0> in@@ ev@@ itable .
now <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> talent <T_0> itself .
so this really <T_1> your <T_0> .
<T_9> we wanted to make <T_7> square of <T_2> 10 , <T_5> or 1,000 , if <T_4> used dna origami <T_1> , we would <T_8> a number <T_0> dna strands that &apos;s the square of the size <T_3> that square ; so we &apos;d need 100 , 10,000 <T_6> a million dna strands .
they do have <T_2> very rich <T_9> of <T_3> and <T_1> , <T_6> of which are similar , or <T_4> identical , to ours <T_8> formed in the <T_5> context . <T_0> chimpanze@@ es <T_7> .
( <T_4> : ... <T_1> person with a <T_2> the <T_0> could do this <T_3>
<T_3> &apos;s pull this <T_1> : <T_2> &apos;ll go ahead and <T_0> it .
there &apos;ll be <T_9> like this , my mom@@ ma said . when you open your hands to <T_7> and wind up with only bli@@ sters and bru@@ ises ; when you step out of <T_6> phone bo@@ oth <T_1> try to <T_4> and the very <T_5> you want to <T_8> are the ones standing <T_0> your <T_3> ; when your boots will fill with rain , and you &apos;ll be up to your k@@ ne@@ es <T_2> dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment .
and so you <T_1> &apos;t sit <T_7> close to <T_3> person <T_4> of your <T_6> that it &apos;s you versus <T_2> universe -- <T_8> &apos;s <T_5> buddha <T_0> .
and <T_3> that were all this <T_1> about , then it <T_0> be an <T_2> thing .
<T_5> , these <T_3> are <T_6> examples <T_4> how photograph@@ y can be <T_1> to <T_0> some of our <T_2> important top@@ ics .
<T_4> 2030 , if the ma@@ ize , or cor@@ n , v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties , which is the domin@@ ant <T_0> -- 50 <T_2> of the <T_8> in <T_6> are still in the field <T_9> in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a <T_7> <T_1> decre@@ ase in production of ma@@ ize <T_5> of the climate change <T_3> in 2030 .
<T_6> , these wi@@ ki revolu@@ tions <T_3> so <T_5> they create a <T_9> , and <T_1> ab@@ h@@ ors a <T_0> , and <T_7> forces <T_2> fill that , <T_8> the old regime , or extre@@ mi@@ sts , or fundament@@ alist <T_4> .

<T_1> we <T_0> .
<T_5> met <T_4> david to <T_1> about <T_3> i <T_2> do <T_0> his company .
so to <T_2> at it , you <T_0> have to get <T_1> of the trees .
<T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_0> have <T_3> gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e <T_2> you have to have a <T_1> .

and <T_6> high school <T_0> who were learning to blog through fo@@ ko clu@@ b <T_3> found themselves talking <T_8> an <T_2> audience about <T_1> demon@@ stra@@ tions , <T_7> violence , <T_5> that was going on <T_4> this <T_9> .
so <T_3> example , i <T_2> the <T_7> of the min@@ ar@@ et <T_0> swi@@ tzer@@ land <T_8> few weeks <T_5> they v@@ oted <T_4> law <T_1> min@@ are@@ ts in the <T_6> .
<T_6> we &apos;re going to deal with <T_5> confli@@ ct@@ -@@ solving of conflicts , <T_7> we &apos;re going to <T_1> these <T_9> groups which <T_4> coming from bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up , supported by <T_3> , which is available to all , we diplo@@ ma@@ ts <T_0> be sitting back in the <T_8> believ@@ ing that we are doing <T_2> relations .
<T_1> ac@@ tor <T_0> a policy that takes into <T_2> the <T_4> of the environment and <T_5> context <T_6> which we <T_3> .
so when we want to learn whether a planet <T_6> hab@@ itable , whether it might be <T_0> to life , we want <T_5> know not <T_7> how much total light it recei@@ ves <T_9> how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space <T_3> -- <T_8> high-@@ energy radiation , <T_4> u@@ v and the x-@@ rays that are created by <T_1> star and that ba@@ the <T_2> in this bat@@ h of high-@@ energy radiation .
<T_1> mean , <T_2> sometimes feels , <T_8> to <T_5> econom@@ ists that they <T_4> kind of putting into <T_9> , <T_7> great <T_6> have <T_0> of intui@@ tively <T_3> for a long time .
<T_0> stopped , and he said , &quot; <T_7> , we <T_6> like to <T_8> that <T_9> deal with our <T_1> problem , <T_3> i think <T_2> would call it <T_4> re@@ verse fishing <T_5> . &quot;
<T_2> i <T_5> , many scientists <T_4> that <T_3> are an <T_1> part of <T_0> dec@@ line .
and it <T_2> just li@@ ght@@ ning <T_1> ; the way she <T_0> working was almost <T_3> .
so <T_8> you have <T_6> teen@@ age <T_3> or a daughter and you <T_4> think they have <T_2> taking <T_5> people &apos;s <T_0> , you &apos;re right . they do . <T_1> this <T_7> why .
<T_9> needs <T_0> extremely well-@@ trained <T_3> with years of <T_2> with complex <T_6> to help her <T_8> the flo@@ ws <T_1> the <T_7> and keep her patients safe and <T_4> throughout <T_5> surgery .
<T_1> is where <T_2> mar@@ ines in the <T_0> get kind of ten@@ se .
so there <T_0> are .
<T_0> i <T_2> i &apos;ll take <T_1> this one .
this <T_1> an <T_0> that <T_2> might care about some@@ day , <T_8> i hope you <T_4> do , because imagine if you <T_6> that call that <T_9> you that bad <T_3> that you <T_7> have <T_5> .
so <T_1> came up with a <T_2> of <T_6> , <T_4> &quot; 10 comm@@ and@@ ments , &quot; <T_7> they were , in <T_8> of <T_0> diffic@@ ul@@ ty : <T_9> first <T_3> &quot; <T_5> magic . &quot;
<T_1> , <T_5> , he doesn &apos;t <T_0> that . <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> different kind <T_3> control .
<T_9> could have looked like shop <T_6> on fif@@ th a@@ venue at <T_8> , <T_7> because of the way that andrew connected with the <T_0> team , he was chan@@ n@@ eling the ra@@ w@@ ness and <T_5> brilli@@ ance of mc@@ que@@ en , and <T_3> show <T_1> quite tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ant , and <T_2> became a <T_4> in its own right .
<T_1> ca@@ it@@ ria and i live <T_0> in <T_2> .
maybe <T_0> little more <T_1> ? &quot;
we are <T_0> responsible .
<T_1> is jobs <T_2> opportunity <T_3> the way up and down the value <T_0> .
<T_1> , 2009 <T_2> hea@@ vy <T_3> for me <T_0> another reason , too .
ev@@ a zei@@ sel : are you sure ?
and so <T_2> went to see him <T_3> he has <T_1> worked on <T_5> for a long <T_4> , <T_6> i &apos;m <T_0> interested in .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_2> been f@@ da <T_3> , and it &apos;ll hopefully be on <T_5> market <T_0> the next <T_1> or so .
<T_7> body has <T_3> organs <T_8> every single or@@ gan <T_0> your body <T_5> a cell population that &apos;s <T_4> to take <T_1> at the time of <T_6> . <T_2> happens every <T_9> .
<T_4> &apos;ve got a <T_3> people <T_2> the <T_5> already , so we <T_1> hand@@ le a <T_0> more .
<T_1> fact , i have <T_0> quali@@ fi@@ cations .
<T_3> couldn &apos;t go out and play <T_1> at re@@ cess <T_2> feeling like i was going to <T_4> out when i got <T_0> inside .
<T_3> i will very <T_0> show you <T_1> it <T_2> .
right .
<T_2> is a <T_0> from <T_1> .
<T_2> this is when <T_1> really gets <T_0> .
<T_2> have the same kind of <T_1> to <T_0> .
<T_1> was <T_3> page of the <T_0> york times a <T_2> months ago .
<T_1> now <T_2> most important thing , that is the <T_0> on@@ stage .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_4> just as simple <T_0> making <T_1> there &apos;s no child <T_3> .
<T_1> , they used <T_0> .
you know , <T_0> grand@@ father died many years ago <T_1> i <T_4> little , but <T_3> love <T_2> ma@@ e west <T_7> on <T_6> a mis@@ sp@@ elling in <T_8> dna of his <T_5> .
language changes over time , and <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> powerful force .
in <T_1> , <T_3> group <T_5> treatment <T_2> met to <T_0> the <T_4> development of the airplane .
so if we could <T_0> out what <T_1> they are , <T_4> could maybe find new <T_3> for which <T_7> could be designed <T_9> scre@@ ened against , <T_2> maybe <T_5> where electro@@ des could be put in <T_8> people who <T_6> very sever@@ e dis@@ ability .
and anybody <T_1> wants to do science is -- <T_6> is about <T_4> time that <T_2> new@@ ton was starting to <T_3> out a <T_5> of really interesting <T_0> .
and <T_2> , &quot; if <T_0> da@@ ily life <T_1> poor , do <T_3> bl@@ ame it ; bl@@ ame <T_4> .
<T_2> , there &apos;s <T_5> another <T_4> , <T_0> another agency within our <T_3> , in ocean <T_1> .
<T_7> i think <T_5> &apos;s such an order of <T_1> change <T_4> your <T_3> or your great@@ -@@ grand@@ kids may be <T_2> species very <T_6> from <T_0> .
it &apos;s a <T_1> source <T_0> stem cells .
<T_0> , when <T_3> spe@@ a@@ ks about <T_1> , everything <T_2> corre@@ ct .
on september 10 , <T_6> morning of my <T_1> birthday , <T_4> came down@@ sta@@ irs to the <T_3> , <T_9> my mother was was@@ hing the dis@@ hes and <T_7> father was reading the <T_0> or something , and i sort of pres@@ ented myself to them <T_2> the do@@ or@@ way , and they said , &quot; hey , happy <T_5> ! &quot; and i said , &quot; <T_8> &apos;m seven . &quot;
<T_0> those <T_2> did not <T_1> .
this kind of <T_0> is called <T_2> balloon <T_1> .
and let <T_2> say this <T_0> a <T_6> of <T_3> -- <T_5> i back <T_1> up to <T_4> bunch of ex@@ -@@ hi@@ pp@@ ies .
<T_3> build that , what we &apos;d do with <T_6> technology is we &apos;d have to take up <T_1> from <T_9> 10 <T_8> mul@@ h@@ oll@@ and , <T_7> from <T_4> 40@@ 5 to <T_5> ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just <T_2> those <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_6> violence has <T_5> been around <T_4> will be around unless <T_2> have <T_0> consciousness <T_3> as a <T_7> .
and <T_2> was dying . <T_1> was <T_3> not <T_0> me a thing .
more <T_1> are living <T_0> than <T_2> land <T_3> support .
<T_0> would pick up the du@@ ty that <T_2> used to have <T_1> that we &apos;ve ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted <T_3> of certain mis@@ -@@ fo@@ unded <T_4> .
so a <T_2> that &apos;s <T_4> with the <T_6> under@@ stands <T_5> it &apos;s going to reach <T_3> isn &apos;t surprised <T_0> its <T_1> .
so to <T_1> , there <T_3> at least four <T_2> head@@ ed <T_0> way .
so , it basically <T_0> , you know , mo@@ unt <T_2> here on <T_1> .
<T_1> whenever <T_4> get a <T_2> i <T_0> work on <T_3> series .
i <T_2> see afri@@ cans <T_1> the same <T_0> that i , as a child , had seen fi@@ de &apos;s <T_3> .
it &apos;s <T_5> stupid <T_0> of <T_6> that puts us , <T_1> and mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que together 50 <T_2> ago , and <T_7> that <T_4> did <T_3> .
and <T_1> , looking at them , you would <T_2> a <T_0> and <T_3> molecule .
<T_4> are <T_9> going to do it ? <T_7> we going to wait <T_5> to <T_1> years for this <T_0> happen <T_3> are we going to <T_8> have this political will to make it happen <T_2> the <T_6> two years ?
what they <T_1> &apos;t tell us is <T_2> some <T_4> are better than others , and <T_5> plants <T_3> whole gra@@ ins should be sup@@ plan@@ ting eating <T_0> food .
and <T_0> just started <T_2> 14 <T_1> ago .
<T_4> now , <T_1> is <T_2> only <T_5> still that we <T_3> is te@@ em@@ ing with <T_0> .
<T_0> now , <T_3> does <T_1> have to <T_2> with it ?
and it <T_3> out to be <T_0> pretty good <T_1> for this <T_2> .
my <T_7> , <T_6> meas@@ ures radiation , <T_2> going ber@@ ser@@ k , <T_0> the closer <T_1> got , the more fr@@ ene@@ tic it <T_3> , and <T_5> . my <T_4> .
<T_0> don &apos;t live <T_1> the <T_6> our <T_5> lived <T_7> , our <T_2> lived in , where career <T_4> for women were <T_3> limited .
we &apos;ve done <T_0> things in <T_6> now in <T_3> single <T_4> that i &apos;ve <T_2> with , getting them to write down <T_1> new <T_8> that they &apos;re <T_9> for for 2@@ 1 <T_5> in a row , three <T_7> things each day .
<T_0> so <T_1> really nice <T_2> came together .
<T_0> now want to share a little <T_5> of <T_3> surgery <T_4> we do -- where <T_2> &apos;re at and <T_1> we &apos;re <T_6> .
thanks for that .
now there is a <T_0> things <T_1> could share with you <T_3> the <T_2> here .
and these <T_2> not <T_0> a <T_3> op@@ pres@@ sed <T_1> poverty .
<T_3> have <T_4> answer <T_2> a <T_0> that we &apos;ve all <T_1> .
<T_1> lunch la@@ dies , the lunch co@@ o@@ ks of <T_3> -- <T_0> offer <T_2> as <T_4> am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
<T_2> could make <T_1> bigger , <T_3> is prote@@ ctive , <T_4> make <T_0> light .
and it &apos;s got this <T_0> hor@@ n-@@ shaped <T_2> , which as far as <T_1> know , again , the <T_3> co@@ ok@@ book to ever do this .
and we &apos;re <T_6> , with our <T_3> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_5> very local <T_0> the <T_7> about within <T_1> or <T_4> degre@@ es .
<T_2> &apos;s looking at whatever <T_1> &apos;ve designed . <T_3> will actually bring <T_0> to life .
i &apos;m <T_3> going to <T_0> them all to you <T_2> i &apos;m <T_4> in <T_1> .
<T_1> tea party lun@@ ch@@ mate and <T_2> came up with <T_4> : <T_3> &apos;t per@@ su@@ ade , de@@ fend <T_0> inter@@ ru@@ pt .
so <T_3> thought , <T_2> , i have to <T_1> some <T_5> of how <T_0> choose <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> just top@@ shop , i get some <T_4> looks when <T_1> go out getting my <T_3> .
we &apos;re going to <T_1> a quick <T_0> together .
<T_8> have no ways to <T_6> obser@@ ve molecules and what <T_7> do -- dre@@ w <T_3> wants to <T_0> that . in this talk , he shows <T_1> scienti@@ fically accurate <T_9> that help <T_5> see un@@ see@@ able <T_2> within <T_4> own cells . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and <T_3> that ecosystem <T_1> , <T_6> could take <T_2> major ecosystem with <T_4> , <T_9> our <T_8> . so , what do <T_0> do <T_5> this ? what are <T_7> solutions ?
now you <T_5> billions of <T_2> machine <T_0> now working away inside <T_4> , <T_6> your <T_3> with <T_1> fi@@ deli@@ ty .
<T_0> my <T_1> i fan@@ t@@ asi@@ ze of <T_2> ven@@ ge@@ ance on you <T_3> .
<T_3> , sky@@ lines are <T_2> glam@@ or@@ ous , city <T_1> -- <T_0> so <T_4> .
<T_0> of course <T_2> all of them were that <T_1> .
so there &apos;s a <T_2> word <T_1> these <T_3> in <T_0> lab .
<T_0> the <T_5> side , <T_3> dose was <T_4> to <T_2> percent , and just look at <T_1> y@@ i@@ eld .
<T_0> dres@@ sed <T_1> ; they were different <T_2> .
<T_1> was like , &quot; what <T_0> that <T_2> ? &quot;
<T_0> don &apos;t read <T_1> .
they <T_0> to o@@ be@@ y four simple <T_1> .
this demo -- from pat@@ t@@ ie <T_9> &apos; lab <T_4> mit , spe@@ ar@@ head@@ ed by pr@@ an@@ a@@ v <T_7> -- <T_1> the bu@@ zz of ted . it &apos;s a <T_3> with a proje@@ ctor <T_2> pa@@ ves the way <T_6> profound interaction with our environment . imagine <T_5> <T_0> report &quot; and <T_8> some .
there <T_0> a <T_1> -- there had to be a way -- <T_4> get people to <T_2> around the <T_3> .
and <T_2> meetings had this <T_1> while taking <T_0> 20 <T_3> .
<T_1> you <T_2> , there &apos;s a <T_0> version of windows <T_3> out this <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s not <T_2> . <T_3> &apos;s <T_0> constru@@ cted .
and we re-@@ create the <T_1> that were <T_5> less than <T_0> billi@@ on@@ th <T_2> a second after <T_9> universe began <T_6> to 600 <T_3> times <T_7> second inside <T_8> dete@@ ctor -- im@@ men@@ se <T_4> .
now just trying putting <T_1> few <T_2> between your teeth <T_5> see the difference <T_4> makes . <T_3>
we &apos;re going to win <T_3> the <T_2> that come <T_4> our eyes actually <T_0> from <T_1> he@@ arts .
<T_0> &apos;re interested in <T_2> dis@@ plays , <T_1> dis@@ plays .
all right .
now <T_4> &apos;s evening , <T_2> my <T_3> first grew <T_1> -- and <T_0> grew m@@ old .
<T_7> &apos;s like <T_3> want to <T_0> that our <T_8> are just these <T_4> trans@@ lu@@ cent <T_6> and <T_5> just <T_1> out of them and describe <T_9> world <T_2> it un@@ fol@@ ds .
but she <T_0> out to us <T_4> that <T_2> , and it was , i &apos;d like to <T_3> , <T_1> was an ic@@ e-@@ break@@ er .
i mean , <T_2> may be <T_5> explan@@ ations for <T_6> ha@@ iti <T_7> the im@@ pover@@ ished <T_0> it is , but <T_3> is <T_8> ex@@ cu@@ se <T_1> see that sort <T_4> squ@@ al@@ or .
the thing that sticks with <T_6> the <T_4> is <T_0> he <T_1> apo@@ logi@@ zing to me <T_5> cr@@ ying <T_7> front of me , and at the <T_3> time , he was also giving <T_2> pro@@ ps , <T_8> me up , <T_9> not cr@@ ying .
<T_4> think <T_2> great <T_1> of this <T_0> eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new health <T_3> program .
<T_2> the rus@@ si@@ an special military police , special forces , <T_4> , <T_3> in and actually <T_0> the <T_1> .
and <T_2> is where , <T_3> and <T_0> , <T_4> famous theme <T_6> getting more <T_1> less for more becomes <T_5> .
<T_0> right . <T_2> significant <T_1> .
<T_8> that was the beginning of a kind of ser@@ ial de@@ ple@@ tion from bigger and <T_2> species to smaller <T_9> not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ ta@@ sty <T_7> , from <T_6> that were near <T_0> home to species that were <T_3> around the <T_5> , <T_4> what <T_1> you .
and <T_1> can &apos;t <T_3> this guy <T_2> google ; <T_4> can &apos;t find him <T_0> .
now we <T_3> not <T_1> yet , <T_0> it is <T_2> .
<T_3> we need <T_0> policies , we <T_2> -- where &apos;s that <T_1> from , you know ?
the more <T_0> question <T_3> : did <T_7> matter <T_1> were <T_6> the <T_2> of the good sa@@ mar@@ it@@ an ? <T_4> : <T_5> , not at all .
<T_7> still need to complete the scre@@ ening <T_6> using <T_9> low <T_4> , <T_5> then our fin@@ dings <T_8> need to be <T_2> at other <T_0> , and this <T_1> take five <T_3> more years .
there &apos;s <T_0> accident in <T_1> of these <T_2> .
<T_0> allows el@@ em@@ ent@@ ar@@ y-@@ level students to <T_4> core subje@@ cts <T_5> game play <T_3> activity and <T_2> around and <T_1> and being a <T_6> .
in fact , <T_0> all humans share a <T_5> need <T_7> desire for <T_2> , <T_9> don &apos;t <T_3> see choice <T_6> the same <T_4> or to <T_1> same <T_8> .
<T_0> mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s , <T_1> started an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia <T_2> en@@ car@@ ta .
<T_8> a job <T_4> . <T_0> sit across the desk from somebody , <T_9> have some pri@@ or <T_6> of you , <T_3> send signals <T_2> the desk <T_5> move their <T_7> of you from one <T_1> to a place where you want it to be .
i didn &apos;t get <T_0> si@@ gh@@ ted .
<T_1> got <T_0> thinking .
<T_2> win@@ s . i <T_1> just go and name <T_0> coun@@ ties that we &apos;ve got around here .
now actually , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> another <T_0> mis@@ con@@ ception .
<T_0> ryan : don &apos;t <T_1> on <T_2> !
one , <T_1> , <T_0> .

and <T_1> other <T_2> : it &apos;s <T_0> .
i &apos;m <T_4> to develop home@@ gro@@ wn <T_7> to <T_1> issues <T_2> we realize that people from <T_5> can come and <T_0> us , but <T_9> we <T_6> &apos;t <T_8> ourselves , there &apos;s nothing we <T_3> do .
<T_2> us <T_0> to read out memories from <T_1> .
<T_1> do you make <T_0> change ?
<T_0> got together -- j@@ p@@ l <T_1> them .
and as it &apos;s <T_5> , it &apos;s comp@@ res@@ sing , <T_3> what you &apos;re <T_9> with , <T_2> on the reci@@ pe , is <T_8> that &apos;s <T_1> like a really li@@ ght-@@ weight , transpar@@ ent paper , <T_4> something which is much <T_6> like a <T_0> vegetable <T_7> .
<T_0> in the <T_6> year , where <T_3> si@@ r@@ lea@@ f <T_7> from , her <T_4> , <T_2> went there to work <T_1> these <T_5> .
<T_3> who have been teaching science for <T_0> years , <T_2> just mu@@ ck up <T_4> definition and they <T_5> it <T_1> .
in order to solve <T_0> puzz@@ les <T_4> , if <T_3> think about it , your mind <T_2> to be in <T_1> states si@@ mul@@ taneously .
<T_2> had <T_0> lo@@ w-@@ tech <T_1> .
as a result , he spent <T_1> four <T_0> in <T_9> , is <T_8> pretty typical <T_6> , and <T_4> never said <T_7> because <T_5> were un@@ prepared <T_2> the <T_3> .
<T_1> taught me how <T_7> look and see , and they did not do <T_0> incredibly stupid thing of <T_5> to a <T_9> , &quot; of all <T_3> things we <T_6> make <T_2> , <T_4> do you like best ? &quot; -- which gives you <T_8> answers that are us@@ able .
<T_4> : <T_2> you &apos;ve <T_3> , what you &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to , <T_5> dra@@ matically <T_0> your <T_1> .
and <T_4> that <T_0> took place three <T_5> ago , <T_3> can remember it <T_2> if <T_1> was yesterday .
<T_0> are big ones . <T_2> are <T_1> ones .
<T_3> will <T_4> for why <T_1> is a <T_0> cri@@ teri@@ on for sele@@ cting <T_2> right theory .
so it <T_1> land <T_0> a <T_2> , for example .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> lot of other <T_1> you can die .
they have <T_0> new drug products <T_2> new drug <T_1> .
here <T_1> some <T_0> .
well , as we <T_3> in <T_2> business , <T_1> mar@@ ks <T_0> spo@@ t .
you <T_1> go to the <T_4> , fill out <T_0> form , give them $ <T_5> , and <T_2> arri@@ ves in the <T_3> .
<T_1> : rele@@ ase our <T_0> .
<T_6> once <T_7> get involved in <T_1> ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic decisions , again <T_9> personally <T_5> with our <T_2> ones and family members , <T_4> also very quickly learn <T_0> benef@@ its , the tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s <T_8> the limit@@ ations of <T_3> tools .
<T_0> i <T_2> understanding that <T_1> revolutionize <T_3> policy .
<T_0> i <T_2> to talk about <T_3> st@@ ages in <T_1> evolution .
so <T_1> started getting <T_4> in those <T_3> and studying <T_0> in other <T_2> .
<T_6> , when looked at <T_8> , <T_7> changed the way i see things , because this <T_0> , this network that &apos;s changing across time , <T_1> has a memory , it <T_5> , things flow <T_3> it , it has a kind of consi@@ sten@@ cy -- people can die , but it <T_4> &apos;t die ; it <T_9> per@@ si@@ sts -- <T_2> it has a kind of res@@ ili@@ ence that allows it to pers@@ ist across time .
<T_2> said , &quot; <T_0> to <T_3> about religion and <T_1> .
and you <T_3> also -- i <T_6> , <T_5> were also <T_0> hacker <T_2> an early <T_4> and <T_7> into <T_1> auth@@ orities early on .
so , what , she <T_2> to <T_0> , could explain <T_1> an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?
and sometimes they <T_0> have to bring <T_8> from <T_2> away to do <T_3> la@@ undry <T_5> home , <T_4> they <T_1> to bring the <T_9> away to <T_7> stream <T_6> off .
so <T_1> started off <T_2> a traditional <T_0> .
<T_7> now know <T_4> my <T_9> streng@@ th <T_0> came from <T_6> body , <T_5> although my <T_1> cap@@ abilities <T_8> changed dra@@ matically , who i <T_2> is <T_3> .
<T_5> everything comes <T_4> that , and <T_3> watch <T_2> cre@@ eping up , and <T_0> own <T_1> as it goes along .
<T_1> &apos;re also <T_0> small <T_2> to <T_3> on a des@@ k@@ top .
<T_1> , <T_0> wasn &apos;t . the <T_2> of <T_4> , so clearly , was the <T_3> of the hig@@ gs bo@@ son .
<T_1> the <T_3> is that any <T_4> that you do that invol@@ ves <T_5> with <T_0> people is <T_2> work .
<T_9> bon@@ net said , <T_3> years ago -- he <T_2> how , thinking these <T_5> , <T_6> , <T_1> he put it , <T_7> theater <T_4> the mind could be gener@@ ated by <T_0> machin@@ ery of the <T_8> .
<T_4> the spirit <T_6> jac@@ qu@@ es <T_9> , who said , &quot; people protect what they love , &quot; i want to share with you today what i <T_8> most in <T_0> ocean , and <T_3> &apos;s <T_7> incredible <T_2> and variety <T_5> animals in it that make <T_1> .
what <T_0> 75 ?
<T_4> is <T_0> first <T_2> on <T_1> written <T_3> the west , at least .
and some of those we <T_1> to <T_3> to <T_0> icon@@ s <T_4> our <T_2> .

to date , jo@@ el &apos;s gotten <T_1> from over <T_4> environmental groups , in the <T_2> states , <T_3> and <T_0> .
but <T_1> think <T_2> girls <T_0> do it .
and i <T_6> it <T_2> that the <T_0> responsibility <T_1> was <T_5> formed as <T_3> of some gr@@ and <T_4> strategy .
<T_1> becomes <T_0> .
i sort of had this picture of this <T_2> wonderful , <T_5> , <T_6> little <T_1> , who <T_4> appeared to be very <T_3> , being ens@@ la@@ ved <T_7> this <T_0> .

and <T_1> you <T_0> beings <T_3> their <T_2> happiness .
we <T_2> it <T_1> other <T_0> . <T_3> who are <T_4> ?
so <T_3> &apos;s working on <T_1> tool right there that <T_0> actually <T_2> the over@@ all system .
<T_2> is <T_3> . a lot <T_0> us <T_5> that <T_1> has to be <T_4> world &apos;s future .
<T_2> is a <T_1> . it <T_0> an ur@@ ge .

but one of the <T_4> things <T_3> the <T_1> for massive <T_2> , it &apos;s not <T_5> finding <T_0> pri@@ mes .
<T_1> is the way <T_0> ought to <T_2> .
<T_1> can <T_2> child <T_0> stronger ?
<T_4> was done <T_2> or <T_3> years <T_1> by <T_0> then gradu@@ ate student , su@@ san@@ a li@@ ma .
<T_2> ask , &quot; <T_9> is the <T_7> possible stuff <T_3> you could make a diagno@@ stic <T_6> out of , <T_8> get useful <T_0> , add <T_4> ? &quot; and what <T_1> &apos;ve cho@@ sen is <T_5> .
<T_3> anyone <T_1> from brazi@@ l , <T_2> &apos;ll <T_0> about this plant .
the <T_1> issue is <T_4> , for <T_5> , design is <T_0> first <T_3> of <T_2> inten@@ tions .
and if we were to fall towards this black <T_5> , we would <T_3> all of that <T_6> len@@ sed around <T_4> , <T_2> we <T_8> even start to cross <T_1> that <T_0> and really not notice that <T_9> dra@@ matic had <T_7> .
so <T_2> was <T_1> the <T_0> was invented .
but <T_2> don &apos;t just diff@@ use in <T_0> popu@@ lations <T_1> ran@@ dom .
<T_2> , &quot; <T_0> can we <T_1> ? &quot;
<T_3> if <T_1> imag@@ ined the <T_0> east <T_2> with <T_6> roo@@ fs , <T_8> stre@@ ams <T_5> through <T_7> city , and wind@@ mil@@ ls sup@@ pl@@ ying the power we <T_4> ?
and when you &apos;re standing <T_3> someone , <T_6> you &apos;re on your <T_8> device , effectively what you &apos;re saying <T_5> them is , &quot; <T_1> are <T_9> as <T_2> as , <T_7> , <T_4> anything <T_0> could come to me through this device . &quot;
so our <T_1> is <T_0> math the <T_3> you &apos;d learn <T_5> , like the way <T_2> would learn a <T_4> .

so <T_0> is the <T_1> .
and across the <T_0> today , we see <T_3> sort of <T_6> arms race , <T_4> cyber@@ war units <T_7> up by <T_2> like <T_1> kor@@ e@@ a <T_8> even <T_5> .

<T_0> put that up .
there &apos;s <T_0> waste .
it &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to <T_0> other .
well , <T_1> &apos;m not here <T_2> to lam@@ ent about the <T_3> , <T_0> wr@@ ing my <T_4> .
<T_1> mean <T_0> is serious . you &apos;re afraid .
<T_3> tells <T_1> every <T_5> what &apos;s <T_4> , by the stories <T_2> choose <T_0> where they place them .
that &apos;s <T_1> current business <T_0> .
i <T_1> the <T_0> .
technology always <T_0> into <T_4> when design is <T_2> , <T_5> science does <T_3> little <T_1> .
so <T_7> we <T_4> is to have <T_0> cau@@ sa@@ tive <T_1> of what &apos;s actually <T_5> on , <T_9> prote@@ om@@ ics actually gives <T_2> the ability <T_6> build <T_3> model <T_8> that .
<T_3> i put <T_0> to the <T_9> of <T_7> leone , <T_4> next day he asked <T_1> world bank to send <T_5> a <T_6> to give exper@@ ti@@ se on how <T_8> condu@@ ct <T_2> .
<T_1> have <T_0> for <T_2> with aller@@ gi@@ es to pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
boy : what &apos;s that supposed <T_0> mean ?
<T_5> lived <T_3> ireland , built the <T_2> stra@@ w-@@ b@@ ale houses <T_6> ireland , <T_0> some co@@ b buildings <T_4> all <T_1> kind of thing .
<T_3> am@@ ong@@ st those <T_2> the <T_4> that , actually , <T_1> are fantastic <T_0> for the blind .
among <T_2> 200 <T_0> mi@@ gr@@ ant workers , <T_3> percent of them are <T_1> people .
<T_5> invol@@ ves communic@@ ators to keep the <T_2> high , to <T_0> the visi@@ bility <T_1> , <T_4> tell <T_3> success stories .
<T_2> cut the <T_1> off of her <T_0> .
you <T_0> use y@@ ar@@ d@@ stick <T_4> , so <T_3> have to <T_2> against <T_1> other for the <T_5> .
so we <T_5> &apos;t really have that many <T_4> , i <T_0> to <T_2> , with <T_3> government <T_1> all the <T_6> .
&quot; it <T_0> awesome .
<T_1> are <T_3> of the <T_2> women <T_0> these d@@ ating sites ?
<T_0> first <T_1> that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
<T_3> was like , &quot; <T_0> cri@@ es <T_1> you in@@ vi@@ te <T_2> to take a walk . &quot;
now <T_2> point <T_4> very ger@@ man@@ e , <T_1> &apos;m afraid , <T_0> the <T_3> .
i <T_2> what <T_0> was comp@@ la@@ ining <T_6> is not <T_7> but rather the le@@ ctu@@ re-@@ based <T_5> that <T_4> many <T_3> spend so much <T_1> on .
<T_4> it &apos;s <T_2> good that what <T_0> done <T_3> being <T_1> .
up <T_2> recently , that was <T_6> solar system -- four ear@@ th-@@ like planets with small <T_0> , smaller <T_9> about <T_5> times the size of <T_4> earth -- <T_7> that was of course <T_1> , ven@@ us , mars , and of course the <T_3> , and <T_8> the two big , giant planets .
<T_5> &apos;ve done <T_1> 40 of them , <T_4> i &apos;d <T_2> 30 of <T_0> are based on that <T_3> .
<T_0> right . <T_2> we &apos;re <T_8> to immer@@ se ourselves in the 72 <T_6> of the planet <T_1> , you <T_9> , <T_7> &apos;s really nai@@ ve to <T_4> that the e@@ aster bun@@ ny put all the <T_3> on <T_5> contin@@ ents .
<T_1> i have to <T_3> that my <T_2> sometimes have to be <T_4> to other <T_0> .
<T_2> this <T_0> , mr. <T_1> .
<T_2> wilkins said &quot; <T_7> . &quot; <T_0> franklin was leaving <T_6> about <T_1> months , and <T_4> she left he would <T_3> building <T_5> .
by the <T_1> , the <T_2> is &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
they <T_0> this question .
use <T_0> force ?
perhaps <T_5> importantly , <T_1> of people jo@@ ined the <T_6> programs and the <T_2> programs that we created <T_4> go around the movies . <T_3>
<T_7> in <T_3> , two in the <T_6> , <T_1> tv ; your <T_2> , <T_0> someone , is next to <T_4> , <T_9> ; doesn &apos;t hear <T_5> , doesn &apos;t wake <T_8> .
<T_5> 85 percent of all <T_0> can@@ cers are <T_1> late , <T_6> someone has less <T_4> a two <T_2> chance <T_3> survival .
now , this quickly , my day job sent me to work out of our mil@@ an office for <T_3> few <T_1> , <T_4> i was like , <T_0> will i <T_8> ? so i actually sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed sleep <T_2> my calendar , and <T_9> the 8@@ -@@ hour time difference <T_5> conference calls with material supp@@ li@@ ers , <T_7> and <T_6> custom@@ ers .
<T_1> i looked at the <T_3> of information <T_2> if it were food and <T_5> , so <T_0> were h@@ unter@@ -@@ ga@@ thers of <T_4> .
<T_2> &apos;s perfectly <T_0> to create <T_3> social <T_4> which lead to more <T_1> societies .
<T_0> like <T_5> all have <T_6> , but some of <T_1> have <T_4> eyes and some of us <T_3> brown <T_2> .
and finally , of course , i think it &apos;s fair to <T_2> that a <T_5> part <T_7> the <T_3> why the public is so <T_6> about aging now is the <T_4> trance i <T_0> about earlier , <T_1> cop@@ ing strategy .
what <T_1> &apos;s about is <T_2> the <T_0> has <T_3> a lot .
let &apos;s go for it , <T_3> while <T_9> &apos;re about it , <T_8> &apos;s have <T_0> bit of <T_1> , for <T_7> , <T_5> the <T_2> and <T_6> ted <T_4> .
we <T_4> this so <T_0> we actually bought <T_2> company and are <T_1> it <T_5> the <T_3> product .
<T_4> how <T_0> manage our <T_3> environment affe@@ cts <T_2> health <T_5> well-@@ being <T_1> people every single day .
she did <T_0> and then <T_1> away .
and <T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> thing .
at that time , <T_0> tri@@ g@@ gers were <T_1> .
and i <T_3> it bo@@ thers <T_1> of my <T_2> friends , <T_4> &apos;s not <T_0> me .
and <T_0> the context <T_4> particular cour@@ ses , you <T_5> ask questions like , what are some of <T_1> mis@@ concep@@ tions that are more common <T_3> how <T_6> we help <T_2> fix <T_7> ?
and then as <T_3> agency explained <T_0> me , they said , &quot; <T_8> , <T_7> don &apos;t have little <T_9> people in our <T_6> ; <T_1> would <T_5> put little <T_2> people <T_4> our ads , for instance ? &quot;

so this <T_0> &quot; ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on &quot; <T_2> ast@@ or <T_1> .
and it was <T_3> theory , <T_0> my point of <T_5> , that <T_2> didn &apos;t up@@ stage <T_4> neigh@@ bor@@ hood -- <T_1> made <T_6> .
<T_2> all of the <T_4> , almost <T_0> of <T_3> surface <T_1> were pres@@ er@@ ved .

cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke <T_0> a <T_1> stimul@@ us .
so i <T_0> to show a <T_5> of a <T_3> game to <T_1> two <T_2> of how <T_6> social <T_4> work .
it <T_0> like <T_2> small sle@@ eping ba@@ g <T_1> a baby .
what <T_3> ? <T_2> as <T_0> is <T_1> .
<T_5> , the connection between biology and dna and <T_8> is <T_2> tan@@ tali@@ zing when you talk about <T_1> because , even back then , his <T_6> very quickly made <T_7> logi@@ cal <T_3> to <T_9> : <T_4> the earth is just a planet , then what about planets around <T_0> stars ?
that <T_1> a <T_3> , <T_0> i <T_2> , &quot; that &apos;s <T_4> . &quot;
<T_1> nonetheless , despite <T_0> ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty , <T_5> left <T_3> vehicle and <T_4> f@@ ought the <T_2> .
let <T_0> define the terms really <T_1> .
<T_3> if <T_2> angle is <T_4> , you can actually see a h@@ olog@@ ra@@ m appear <T_0> this film <T_1> silk .
<T_6> other times , we might take <T_0> foot <T_2> the gas a little <T_3> too much , <T_1> things <T_4> become <T_5> sort of little bit like <T_7> .
sometimes <T_0> would <T_3> their <T_5> to draw <T_6> they wanted to <T_2> , and the guy <T_4> to feed his <T_1> , right ?
there &apos;s <T_6> any information available on <T_4> to <T_0> them , <T_3> very <T_2> is said about <T_5> they are <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s what <T_0> home@@ girl is <T_2> .

we &apos;re <T_6> about <T_3> society that is <T_1> into depression <T_5> dis@@ association <T_2> we are poten@@ tially <T_4> the next great <T_0> shift .
<T_5> they did not turn out to <T_1> the islam@@ ist <T_2> that <T_6> di@@ ct@@ ators were <T_3> using <T_4> justi@@ fy <T_0> regime .
<T_6> when <T_2> said to our parents <T_3> grand@@ parents , &quot; <T_0> would you <T_4> if tomorrow <T_1> you wo@@ ke up <T_5> ? &quot;
<T_1> was <T_6> you could have said <T_4> your <T_5> when he <T_3> she <T_2> , &quot; i <T_0> a <T_7> . &quot;

<T_6> we went to the <T_1> , played <T_5> up <T_3> , <T_7> we went to the <T_4> fe@@ ature <T_2> our own <T_0> .
we &apos;re explor@@ ing <T_3> limits of <T_4> we <T_0> can do to make a <T_1> world <T_5> open <T_2> technology .
i won &apos;t go into this very much , but <T_0> technology , <T_5> being able to tag <T_8> and meta@@ sta@@ tic <T_7> with flu@@ ores@@ cence , we can also use the <T_9> <T_4> three-@@ part molecule <T_3> tag g@@ adol@@ ini@@ um onto <T_2> system so you <T_6> do this <T_1> .

<T_1> you are , pul@@ ling off <T_0> band@@ -@@ aid .
<T_6> view is that <T_1> you want to invol@@ ve yourself <T_4> the <T_3> of people <T_2> have been given up on , you have to <T_7> like <T_5> solution <T_8> not <T_0> problem .

<T_6> &apos;s <T_8> simple , and <T_1> thought , you <T_7> , <T_4> , it costs between <T_0> and <T_2> bucks to provide school <T_3> for a <T_5> .
<T_3> the other <T_0> , <T_6> example the <T_5> , <T_2> bor@@ row only against the amount of <T_4> in circu@@ lation inside its <T_1> bor@@ ders .
and <T_4> think <T_6> of you can agree <T_5> if <T_7> can figure out <T_9> to <T_1> life by a factor of <T_2> , you &apos;ve probably <T_0> your lifest@@ yle by a lot , say your sal@@ ary , <T_3> &apos;d notice , <T_8> your kids , you &apos;d notice .
<T_3> own sense <T_2> self-@@ ag@@ gran@@ di@@ z@@ ement <T_6> that <T_7> important <T_5> need to have big important , <T_0> most of all , <T_1> solutions atta@@ ched <T_4> them .
<T_2> problem <T_1> not the <T_3> we <T_0> vi@@ cti@@ ms of .
<T_3> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> how you do <T_2> .
<T_8> year <T_6> ted we <T_2> to try to cl@@ ari@@ fy <T_4> over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming comple@@ xity <T_3> ri@@ chn@@ ess that <T_7> experience at the <T_1> in a <T_5> called big <T_0> .

<T_2> the other <T_3> is <T_0> i &apos;m actually okay <T_1> that .
and over <T_9> years , around <T_8> turn of the 20th century , it started to take <T_5> this <T_7> kind of <T_6> -- this <T_2> for any <T_4> interest in , <T_3> association <T_0> , an object through which it appears del@@ usi@@ vely mag@@ ni@@ fied <T_1> gl@@ ori@@ fied .

<T_1> a <T_3> , he <T_7> , you know , we talk <T_9> <T_2> , but <T_0> do it in <T_4> way <T_6> that <T_5> an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t to <T_8> &apos;s dig@@ ni@@ ty .
this <T_4> not <T_3> proje@@ cting power , but about sta@@ ying power , <T_0> is about <T_1> with the <T_2> .
to <T_4> a <T_0> from my country &apos;s <T_5> , it <T_2> you to <T_3> up <T_1> audience .
well <T_3> of all , it is <T_2> mind , which is <T_1> flow of <T_0> images .
<T_1> it had to be <T_3> in a <T_0> new <T_2> .
<T_5> : <T_3> works <T_2> well . you <T_0> there &apos;re <T_1> fish inside <T_4> as well .
then <T_1> typical <T_2> respon@@ ds , &quot; stop <T_0> non@@ sense . &quot;
<T_1> : <T_0> .
<T_3> in <T_6> mean time , perhaps <T_8> &apos;re <T_2> , <T_0> is <T_4> game <T_7> to be talking to us <T_1> dea@@ th@@ bed <T_5> ?
they <T_0> not people from <T_1> .
i <T_0> , <T_4> about <T_3> . how <T_2> . how <T_1> .
<T_0> we do like <T_1> co@@ ck@@ tail or two .
<T_2> send the <T_1> to make <T_0> .
<T_3> have just <T_2> an <T_5> of this <T_1> , and <T_4> evidence that is there for <T_0> to see <T_6> quite remarkable .
why the <T_1> for <T_2> money , then doing <T_0> ?
so , me@@ me@@ tics : <T_0> is fo@@ unded <T_1> the <T_2> of <T_3> darwin@@ ism .
and now , for <T_0> next <T_3> , i &apos;d like to <T_1> to <T_2> classi@@ cs .
<T_4> role <T_2> to bring <T_3> voice <T_1> people who <T_0> vo@@ ic@@ eless .

so we try and get <T_4> of those , and so doing , try to <T_1> rid of the <T_3> , the emotions , <T_8> ideas that ens@@ la@@ ve us , <T_5> make our <T_7> closed , give us tun@@ ne@@ l vision so <T_2> don &apos;t see the <T_6> of others -- and free <T_9> and <T_0> ourselves from that .
let &apos;s assu@@ me <T_2> go to <T_6> c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , or you might go to <T_5> . you might <T_4> to latin america , <T_7> , <T_1> , <T_0> in <T_3> .

<T_2> &apos;s the <T_0> of the reser@@ ve <T_1> what is <T_3> regu@@ lation of the <T_4> ?
thank you .
<T_1> if <T_2> partner puts <T_6> on them -- so <T_0> the partner starts spit@@ ting <T_3> and <T_4> them -- then <T_5> choices go <T_7> .
and in <T_1> , i <T_0> a research leave to <T_2> them .
<T_2> , you know , for <T_1> i would go to <T_4> and , sort of , anyone i met whose name <T_3> eric i was hum@@ ping <T_0> , or something .
<T_1> joy : what i &apos;m wor@@ ried <T_0> , what i &apos;m <T_2> about

and then , because <T_0> &apos;m looking <T_2> the <T_1> here , i &apos;ve got to have believ@@ able up@@ side .
&quot; my <T_1> is <T_2> , <T_0> bond . &quot;
<T_3> we can &apos;t yet <T_0> that , but i think <T_1> path <T_2> la@@ id out .
<T_2> key <T_0> , <T_1> do you put all of the <T_3> ?
and he said , &quot; i <T_5> &apos;t know who <T_1> her , but , &quot; <T_0> said , &quot; <T_3> &apos;s running <T_6> or@@ phan@@ age , and <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> here three days . &quot;
and <T_3> reason is <T_0> tool <T_4> , in the beginning -- for <T_5> of years , <T_6> has <T_7> a <T_1> modi@@ fication <T_2> self .

<T_2> like the one <T_0> just <T_1> , it <T_4> produce these as <T_3> of light .
<T_7> li@@ ke@@ lihood <T_5> people will get to <T_2> end <T_1> much <T_3> when <T_6> is a <T_0> somewhere in <T_4> middle .

<T_0> the first <T_4> , che@@ wing away , <T_1> , &quot; <T_5> know , <T_3> film is <T_2> bad . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s where it <T_0> .
<T_0> then over the summer , they &apos;re <T_1> a summer job .
pa@@ tho@@ s appears obviously <T_2> part <T_0> what <T_1> just saw <T_5> that little <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> .
the bert <T_1> and <T_5> bran@@ sons of <T_2> world <T_6> got this <T_4> their si@@ ghts <T_3> i <T_0> them .
<T_0> it &apos;s so <T_3> , <T_2> has <T_1> there .
and i look at something <T_1> this <T_8> it makes <T_6> question , if we were to take all the func@@ tion@@ ality <T_2> things like this , and <T_4> them around the <T_7> in some <T_5> of personal area <T_9> , how <T_3> we pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze where to put <T_0> ?
for example , terrorism . <T_3> are always <T_8> in min@@ or and major ways <T_6> new <T_7> , <T_4> despite <T_9> you might <T_2> on tv , <T_1> adap@@ tations , and the <T_0> of them , are fundamentally <T_5> .
<T_2> the one that &apos;s really been <T_9> of stres@@ sing <T_1> out , that <T_4> haven &apos;t been able to <T_5> out , <T_7> this <T_8> &quot; <T_0> a <T_6> , <T_3> . &quot;
down <T_0> here , <T_3> see calls made <T_1> both mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es <T_5> also <T_2> over very long <T_4> .
<T_0> you can think <T_2> how <T_1> that would be .
we <T_1> &apos;t expor@@ ted one <T_0> yet .
this <T_2> a full <T_0> of cal@@ ms <T_1> .
to me , <T_3> most mind-@@ ben@@ ding example <T_8> the <T_7> of the ocean comes <T_5> an <T_6> experiment where <T_2> took a ship <T_9> the <T_1> indian ocean , de@@ plo@@ yed an underwater <T_0> and played back a <T_4> .
it &apos;s <T_1> positive , virtu@@ ous <T_0> .
the <T_2> as <T_0> act <T_1> passion . &quot;
well <T_2> can begin to <T_0> those <T_1> also .
so <T_5> is comb@@ ining <T_1> fe@@ der@@ al level , which <T_4> the <T_2> , the state <T_3> and the <T_0> level .
i <T_0> &apos;t know .
<T_1> answer <T_0> interesting .
they switch really <T_2> , <T_0> swi@@ ft@@ ly . <T_4> pay a <T_1> small <T_3> .
<T_0> question <T_3> : how <T_1> will <T_4> take you to fill <T_2> up ?
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> quite <T_2> .
<T_1> can also start to <T_2> what you <T_0> .

<T_0> , <T_4> , <T_2> do we mean by <T_1> ? <T_3> &apos;s one thing .
<T_2> you should see <T_1> during the <T_0> .

<T_2> &apos;s what makes a <T_0> of afri@@ cans very <T_1> .
and <T_3> you start <T_0> , <T_1> cannot <T_2> .
and <T_3> might <T_2> reli@@ ev@@ ed to <T_0> even rather <T_4> mathemati@@ cians think <T_1> .

<T_0> &apos;s one of <T_1> ho@@ b@@ by@@ hor@@ ses .
that <T_2> encourage the <T_1> of relatively <T_3> mu@@ tations of the most <T_0> v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties .
but <T_2> i had to go around <T_4> world <T_1> a balloon <T_3> be inv@@ ited to talk <T_0> it .
<T_1> do we <T_0> finance ?
trying <T_3> figure that <T_0> out . <T_2> is it going to get <T_1> anywhere ?
<T_1> , <T_2> &apos;s that kind <T_0> pat@@ r@@ on .
now , in <T_3> , <T_5> si@@ ber@@ ia , near <T_7> t@@ ung@@ us@@ ka region -- for those <T_0> you who are dan a@@ y@@ kro@@ y@@ d fan@@ s and saw &quot; g@@ ho@@ st@@ bu@@ sters , &quot; when <T_8> talked about <T_9> greatest cros@@ s-@@ dimensional ri@@ ft <T_1> the si@@ ber@@ ia bl@@ ast of <T_2> , where he got the <T_4> wrong , but <T_6> &apos;s okay .
so <T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> of what we &apos;re looking for .
<T_3> i walked <T_2> their prototyp@@ e <T_0> , and <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> like my <T_7> , <T_6> bigger -- same <T_5> , same things .
now , you <T_4> describe <T_3> as <T_5> simple <T_0> -- <T_1> strange en@@ coun@@ ter <T_2> humans .

this <T_2> that <T_5> have <T_0> focus on <T_4> our <T_6> are going to be engaged in productive <T_3> in <T_1> lives .
so if <T_2> put it <T_1> the <T_0> door , <T_4> design <T_3> .
<T_3> ? so <T_1> should <T_2> sat down <T_0> .

you &apos;re actually hearing <T_2> seeing <T_3> electr@@ on <T_0> with the <T_1> .

it <T_2> &apos;t <T_0> with the electro@@ magnetic <T_3> , which <T_1> what we <T_4> to dete@@ ct <T_5> .
i <T_2> born in <T_0> , i grew up <T_5> mexico and <T_1> the way , <T_4> learned to <T_3> mexico .
and so i <T_0> up <T_5> the economy was <T_1> for <T_4> war in iraq <T_2> the same <T_3> .
and therefore , we set up <T_0> experiments .
so let &apos;s take a look <T_0> the <T_1> .
now , you <T_0> see africa &apos;s total <T_1> there and <T_2> u.k. budget de@@ fic@@ it for reference .
<T_1> &apos;s something <T_0> believe that just , <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> , but it &apos;s wrong .
the <T_0> thing is to be a mensch <T_1> &quot;
and it <T_0> an <T_1> virg@@ in <T_2> .
so on the <T_1> hand , <T_2> is <T_4> a basic <T_0> of the <T_3> medical record .
they are stories with a <T_0> .
the 25 <T_0> . this lights <T_1> brain <T_2> .
and <T_1> said , &quot; so is <T_2> true that <T_0> fa@@ ked your way <T_3> here ? &quot;
and <T_5> c@@ at scan reve@@ aled <T_3> blood <T_0> in <T_6> lung , <T_8> it showed <T_9> , <T_7> , pal@@ p@@ able breast mas@@ ses , breast <T_2> , that had <T_4> wid@@ ely <T_1> over the body .
but <T_3> don &apos;t know <T_6> there &apos;s any other dom@@ ini@@ can people <T_0> , but <T_1> know that <T_4> en@@ ri@@ que@@ z , he <T_5> here <T_2> .

<T_3> consider <T_1> situation <T_5> which the mot@@ ors stay <T_2> , <T_4> fly continu@@ es on <T_6> path <T_9> it suff@@ ers some <T_0> con@@ sequence such <T_7> getting <T_8> .

<T_1> if <T_0> anti@@ body is stuck <T_6> one of these things <T_2> the cell , <T_4> means &quot; <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> . &quot;

<T_3> are out <T_1> , but <T_5> &apos;s more of <T_2> personal <T_4> interests me , <T_7> this <T_6> -- this is <T_0> i am .
and those three <T_0> are the <T_2> of <T_1> .
and <T_4> all of this , i can <T_3> conclu@@ de <T_0> people , not <T_5> students , <T_2> really <T_1> for this .
<T_1> molecular structures would <T_0> possible , no <T_2> .
bat@@ man , <T_1> against <T_2> guys , he has his u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty b@@ elt , <T_4> has his gra@@ p@@ pling ho@@ ok , he has <T_3> different kinds of <T_0> .
well , many of <T_5> have <T_1> image , don &apos;t you , <T_0> the spo@@ tty <T_3> sitting in <T_4> bas@@ ement , <T_6> away <T_2> not@@ ori@@ ety .
and that &apos;s <T_3> designers , <T_4> and <T_0> , are working on <T_1> rather than on <T_2> .
<T_0> is <T_1> most well-@@ known <T_2> , <T_4> and@@ o &apos;s church <T_3> light .
<T_1> &apos;s shared <T_0> .
<T_5> tor@@ o@@ id , <T_4> those <T_6> don &apos;t <T_0> , <T_8> the <T_2> of a <T_1> or , for some of <T_3> , a <T_7> .
<T_0> started <T_1> .
because of course <T_6> didn &apos;t tell us that they had three station wa@@ g@@ ons full of <T_3> , model concep@@ ts , pictures -- everything i wanted , they &apos;d lo@@ cked up in the <T_5> , because they <T_9> shown soli@@ dar@@ ity with <T_0> engineers -- and <T_8> &apos;d decided not to show me anything , in order to give <T_1> chance for problem <T_2> a chance to start , because <T_4> hadn &apos;t realized , of course , <T_7> they couldn &apos;t do problem creating .
<T_4> was very <T_2> and more <T_1> than anything <T_0> &apos;d ever <T_3> before .
<T_0> atta@@ ched to <T_1> .
it &apos;s <T_1> &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
<T_9> is a descri@@ ption of <T_0> changes in one enzy@@ me <T_3> you dri@@ p <T_6> chemical <T_5> from some red gra@@ pe <T_7> onto some <T_1> cells <T_2> a dis@@ h <T_4> a <T_8> in a laborat@@ ory somewhere .
<T_4> even though <T_2> color was <T_0> hi@@ de@@ ous , <T_3> did love the <T_8> , and it really c@@ em@@ ented <T_5> love aff@@ air with <T_7> that &apos;s <T_1> on to this <T_6> .
so , <T_1> book <T_5> i have in <T_2> hand <T_0> a dire@@ ct@@ ory <T_4> everybody who had <T_6> email address in <T_3> .
<T_4> you <T_3> to realize that <T_1> inci@@ dents did <T_2> happen in convenient <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;t it <T_0> that <T_1> 4@@ 7@@ -year-old hus@@ band is <T_3> losing the <T_2> ?
<T_4> so <T_1> next <T_9> was : what <T_5> when <T_2> are tra@@ ding back and forth , something <T_8> &quot; <T_6> f@@ ours , &quot; which is <T_7> they do <T_3> in a <T_0> experiment ?
and so you <T_3> go in and have <T_6> billion different <T_7> that are all <T_1> identical , <T_2> they diff@@ er from each other <T_5> on their tips , on <T_0> sequence <T_4> co@@ des for one <T_8> .
<T_5> report that <T_2> on <T_3> johnson &apos;s desk when <T_0> was two <T_1> old -- <T_4> .
the <T_4> stage <T_1> we &apos;re in <T_0> is the <T_2> of <T_3> pages .
and <T_2> states have <T_0> policies , coun@@ ty by <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s called <T_1> cir@@ cul@@ ar flow of the economy .
<T_4> we have a <T_0> proto@@ cell <T_1> a self-@@ replic@@ ation <T_3> . <T_2> .
<T_4> as <T_1> held on , and <T_0> brea@@ th@@ ed as one , we <T_3> we weren &apos;t on this <T_2> alone .
<T_1> can <T_4> hear it <T_2> , because <T_0> see <T_3> time is ti@@ cking off .
<T_1> mar@@ gon@@ elli : the political <T_0> of <T_2>
<T_0> didn &apos;t <T_1> want to go there .
<T_4> the amount of <T_2> each of us <T_3> spending doing <T_1> of this is also <T_0> to go grow .
this <T_1> had just been <T_0> from <T_2> hu@@ tu death camp .
but governments hate <T_1> di@@ y economy , and that &apos;s why -- <T_8> took this picture in 2007 , and <T_9> is the <T_0> market <T_2> 2009 -- and i think , when <T_6> organi@@ zers of <T_3> conference were talking about <T_5> op@@ en@@ ness , they didn &apos;t mean that the <T_4> should be open and the <T_7> should be gone .
<T_2> let <T_1> tell <T_6> right now , <T_5> &apos;s fine that <T_0> would all be very <T_4> with <T_3> .
<T_1> , so <T_0> of you are .
and <T_0> i have <T_1> 15@@ -year-old , <T_3> i do is <T_2> and <T_4> and <T_5> .
and so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> back in time <T_3> that <T_2> moment .
and the <T_3> step <T_2> wasn &apos;t the <T_0> diversity of <T_6> , but rather <T_5> tax@@ on@@ om@@ ic speci@@ ali@@ sts who <T_8> identify and <T_1> these <T_7> that became <T_4> limit@@ ing step .
bat@@ tel@@ le <T_2> and <T_1> jo@@ ined up in <T_0> , <T_3> .
we <T_0> very <T_3> , as <T_2> to <T_1> pro@@ active about what <T_4> .
so in <T_1> end <T_4> powerful ambi@@ tion that had car@@ ried <T_2> through his <T_0> childhood <T_3> been <T_5> .
<T_6> , so , that <T_0> to <T_3> of an ultimate <T_1> : <T_8> it be that <T_5> out there in the <T_4> universe we might find <T_7> physical <T_2> ?
<T_0> the <T_1> part of this is that <T_7> &apos;ve all <T_9> , nonetheless , on the really <T_2> capac@@ i@@ ties that <T_8> have -- their capac@@ i@@ ties for <T_4> . i mean , si@@ ren@@ a <T_3> night was a <T_5> , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she <T_6> do .
<T_1> i <T_3> the little <T_0> with a broken sh@@ ard <T_4> glass , constru@@ cted this little apartment <T_2>
these <T_0> were <T_1> .
now <T_3> you can <T_2> , <T_1> is not <T_0> popular with four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders .
so it <T_1> me understand <T_3> agriculture , <T_4> of course is <T_0> car@@ tes@@ ian <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> context .
<T_3> &apos;m <T_1> asked , <T_2> surpris@@ es you <T_0> the <T_4> ?
<T_0> , <T_3> would <T_1> save time <T_6> having to loo@@ p <T_7> to <T_4> house <T_5> he &apos;d gone to everybody <T_2> &apos;s ?
<T_4> of <T_3> have lost <T_0> ability to trans@@ late <T_2> bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ms <T_1> action , into movement .
so <T_2> doctors <T_0> these are eye <T_1> .
he got <T_4> in <T_1> for it , but i have <T_2> words <T_0> on my <T_3> .
we <T_8> know how to kill <T_4> , <T_7> some <T_5> come to you <T_0> say , &quot; <T_3> have <T_2> millions . <T_1> about <T_6> ? &quot;
let <T_0> tell you <T_1> ancient chinese satur@@ day after@@ no@@ on kung f@@ u secret .
<T_5> , <T_1> might actually <T_3> them to <T_7> all the kinds of <T_2> things <T_0> humans <T_8> when <T_6> start ex@@ changing money <T_4> each other .
what we do <T_5> is , if you &apos;re not prepared <T_2> be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with <T_8> original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be <T_7> . <T_0> by the time <T_3> get to be <T_6> , most <T_1> have <T_4> that capacity .
what tony sees <T_2> that moment is <T_5> project of <T_0> , <T_8> project that <T_7> in wonder -- <T_3> kant called &quot; ad@@ mi@@ ration <T_1> a@@ we at <T_6> star@@ ry sky above <T_4> the moral <T_9> within . &quot;
<T_4> &apos;s familiar with <T_5> , <T_1> we don &apos;t normally <T_0> of cancer as <T_3> a <T_2> disease .
loy@@ al@@ ty essentially <T_0> a micro@@ -@@ economy .
he <T_1> , &quot; <T_2> , that &apos;s the electron@@ ic <T_0> network . &quot;
<T_4> &apos;s what &apos;s known as <T_7> biol@@ umines@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ arm , and <T_9> like <T_6> al@@ arm on your car or <T_8> house , it &apos;s meant <T_1> cast <T_5> attention <T_3> the in@@ tru@@ der , there@@ by either le@@ ading to <T_2> capture <T_0> sc@@ aring him away .
we <T_0> these international <T_2> work because <T_3> &apos;ve already got <T_1> .
we &apos;ve got a choice <T_0> us .
the <T_2> on the <T_4> , <T_5> lo@@ is <T_3> thought that <T_0> made no <T_1> .
the <T_0> that <T_2> beha@@ ves , <T_5> fact that <T_3> can <T_1> transi@@ stors , is <T_4> pur@@ ely quantum phenomen@@ on .
so what <T_4> this <T_1> architecture con@@ figuration that <T_2> the <T_0> sing <T_3> be so <T_5> ?
<T_5> you &apos;ll <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> one <T_2> last bit that &apos;s still rema@@ ining <T_0> .
<T_0> . <T_1> got &apos; <T_2> .
<T_2> haven &apos;t seen <T_3> , ok , <T_4> it puts limits on what the <T_0> and <T_5> interaction streng@@ th of these dark matter <T_1> are .
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east , i have <T_3> been as optimi@@ stic <T_8> i am today that the <T_2> between the muslim world and the <T_1> is nar@@ ro@@ wing fast , <T_4> one <T_5> the many <T_9> for my optimis@@ m is that , because i know there are millions , <T_0> of millions of <T_6> , muslims like that old ima@@ m <T_7> tun@@ is , who are re@@ cla@@ im@@ ing this word and re@@ stor@@ ing to its original , beautiful pur@@ pose .
here <T_2> have the <T_0> of the <T_1> of nature .
<T_0> didn &apos;t know a <T_1> .
and <T_1> lung <T_4> , so somebody <T_6> me <T_3> and put a <T_0> in there as well <T_7> stop <T_5> cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c <T_2> from happening .
you <T_5> the geni@@ ality of <T_6> creation , right <T_1> on <T_8> ground layer of the <T_7> , and <T_9> this <T_4> thing , finding , i should rather say , an <T_3> . because of <T_2> elephant , over 70 new <T_0> came out , never seen for centuries .
there are <T_0> million <T_1> being po@@ sted <T_2> day .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> fundamental problem we have in de@@ aling <T_0> these <T_1> problems ?
it <T_2> seem really <T_0> to get <T_1> to do <T_4> right <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;s social . <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> at <T_0> .
<T_0> i &apos;m wrong . &quot;
we then <T_1> a sc@@ aff@@ old <T_2> we shape like a <T_0> .
don &apos;t give in to <T_0> wall .
&quot; <T_2> fur@@ ther@@ more , <T_1> is <T_0> thought that <T_3> . &quot;
so when <T_4> plant is <T_2> , it <T_5> actually make <T_1> phone call <T_3> post a message to a <T_6> like <T_0> .
<T_2> thought <T_1> hit@@ t@@ ing-@@ it@@ -@@ out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the-@@ box number was 1@@ 50,000 nets <T_0> year .
<T_0> are the <T_2> that they all <T_1> ?
<T_1> me it <T_0> a <T_2> discovery .
<T_0> need to .
you see , the <T_1> is the <T_0> device here .
<T_8> wanted to create <T_1> system <T_6> ideas <T_2> &apos;t just <T_3> down but <T_4> per@@ col@@ ate <T_7> from the <T_0> and be ad@@ ju@@ sted <T_5> real time .
but i guess <T_3> other <T_9> to add is , if <T_2> do have emplo@@ ye@@ es , <T_8> you do have a <T_0> , i think <T_6> have <T_1> responsi@@ bili@@ ties <T_4> demon@@ strate <T_7> you are thinking ahead <T_5> them , and you are trying to plan .
so in a sense , <T_1> we@@ blogs coming <T_0> new <T_2> .
<T_1> what <T_3> the <T_0> enti@@ ties to <T_2> table ?
and <T_7> m@@ um <T_8> , &quot; dar@@ ling , <T_6> that <T_2> can &apos;t <T_4> and you can &apos;t <T_0> the <T_1> and you can &apos;t feel <T_5> print <T_9> the <T_3> . &quot;
but <T_2> machines that power the <T_4> of the <T_8> are <T_3> quite amazing , and <T_7> really are <T_0> basis of all <T_1> because all of <T_6> machines interact with <T_5> other .
so let &apos;s start <T_0> the united <T_1> , since that &apos;s where <T_2> are today .
<T_3> think about some of the <T_0> that <T_4> &apos;re learning <T_1> cell@@ ular <T_2> .
<T_1> ! what <T_0> computers ?
<T_1> people &apos;s expec@@ tations for <T_0> future went up <T_2> .
<T_2> den@@ ne@@ tt : see <T_1> sha@@ do@@ ws going back <T_3> forth ? <T_0> big .
and <T_1> i <T_3> in , <T_2> was already at the <T_0> .
and <T_6> haven &apos;t the <T_0> idea of <T_1> it <T_5> or what it &apos;s good <T_4> , but <T_2> want <T_3> .
ok , everybody <T_1> books <T_3> imagine <T_0> te@@ aring out <T_2> pages .
so <T_0> el@@ ders <T_3> me some very <T_1> and <T_2> ad@@ vice .
<T_2> you <T_0> what <T_1> was right here ?
<T_4> &apos;s <T_6> represent@@ ation of <T_7> , <T_5> , <T_0> what <T_2> can <T_9> think of x@@ m@@ l in <T_3> case , is it &apos;s the pack@@ aging that <T_1> &apos;re putting around these <T_8> .
<T_1> can do this <T_0> groups <T_2> well .
<T_0> then <T_2> man@@ ned space <T_1> ?
so none of us should be <T_1> that two out <T_0> three ex@@ -@@ offen@@ ders re-@@ off@@ end <T_2> five <T_3> .
and <T_0> he went <T_6> , <T_5> then he turned to <T_4> and <T_1> , &quot; <T_2> &apos;re an <T_3> .
<T_3> this <T_1> , <T_6> the first <T_0> using it , <T_4> she <T_5> artic@@ u@@ late it many different <T_2> .
<T_2> other <T_3> , i ad@@ ded <T_1> u@@ gly version <T_0> tom .
<T_1> the occu@@ pan@@ ts of <T_2> universe , the <T_0> itself is <T_3> waste@@ ful .
even <T_5> near@@ est <T_0> , <T_2> sun -- its emissions <T_1> the <T_3> of light <T_4> .
because <T_1> the <T_7> four <T_0> we &apos;ve seen all kinds of <T_6> , all <T_4> of trends <T_2> born right on <T_5> front <T_3> .
so <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> at how <T_4> is re-@@ estab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that <T_0> in the <T_1> east .
so if i now <T_1> this <T_3> into <T_2> magnetic <T_0> , <T_4> would change its <T_5> .
what you &apos;re getting is <T_1> range of <T_2> conver@@ sations , each connected <T_8> each other <T_7> the <T_3> and <T_0> language they share , <T_6> a <T_5> concept of <T_4> environment .
india still <T_1> a long way to go to <T_2> up with <T_0> .
<T_1> the <T_2> , do@@ od@@ ling should be le@@ ver@@ aged <T_3> precisely <T_5> situations <T_7> information den@@ sity is <T_0> high <T_4> the need for <T_6> that information is very high .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> system <T_0> systems .
<T_2> example , the el@@ ev@@ ators in <T_3> building most likely <T_4> controll@@ ed <T_1> one of <T_0> .
and i think <T_5> even more wonderful <T_8> , which i &apos;m going to <T_4> a big ch@@ unk of , which sums up what <T_3> said at the beginning about <T_2> there is more <T_9> life than <T_1> , and more <T_7> we <T_0> try and measure <T_6> money .
<T_0> we <T_1> is make <T_3> very <T_2> electric motor .
<T_9> then he goes and cham@@ pi@@ ons <T_2> like the <T_4> &quot; three-@@ stri@@ kes &quot; law that would dis@@ connect <T_1> from the internet for fi@@ le sharing , <T_0> has been con@@ dem@@ ned by the u.@@ n@@ . special ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur on <T_5> of expression as being a dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate viol@@ ation of citizens &apos; right to <T_6> , <T_7> has rais@@ ed questions am@@ ong@@ st civil society groups about whether some political <T_8> are more interested in <T_3> the interests of the enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment industry than they are in defen@@ ding the rights of their citizens .
<T_2> can take <T_0> completely for <T_1> .
<T_0> i was <T_1> lucky .
well , the reason it &apos;s such a bad job is that there &apos;s somebody <T_0> at you a <T_1> of the time .
he <T_2> it down for <T_4> months <T_1> experiment <T_0> a <T_3> kitchen st@@ af@@ f .
<T_3> this were bat@@ t@@ le@@ star gal@@ ac@@ tica <T_2> you &apos;re <T_6> the <T_5> , <T_4> &apos;t <T_1> behind the <T_0> hole .
and that &apos;s really how <T_1> became an <T_0> . &quot;
i <T_6> &apos;t . <T_7> , <T_1> suspe@@ ct , do <T_2> other people <T_3> are <T_4> about what <T_0> future <T_5> bring .
we did the <T_0> equivalent of a <T_1> .
<T_1> promis@@ e <T_0> read that <T_2> .
you know , we <T_1> make <T_0> from car <T_2> .
as i stand <T_3> them , i see <T_7> just <T_2> cloud , <T_1> understand <T_8> what <T_5> have the privilege to <T_9> is the <T_0> forces , the same process in a small@@ -@@ scale version that helped to create our <T_6> , our solar system , our sun and <T_4> this very planet .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> heard of the casu@@ al <T_1> thing .
<T_3> : <T_2> &apos;s like <T_1> &apos;m just <T_0> up , you know ?
<T_0> father <T_2> king <T_4> , &quot; <T_3> will mar@@ ry a <T_1> prin@@ cess ? &quot;
<T_4> , <T_1> do i do <T_3> , and <T_2> do i do this , and all of <T_0> sort of thing .
<T_6> this en@@ ables <T_1> to <T_7> why the symmetries of <T_2> objects -- they <T_5> have <T_8> symmetries . so why <T_4> &apos;t we say <T_0> have the same <T_3> ?
now what <T_2> goals ? <T_1> are <T_0> going toward ?
<T_1> is <T_4> area way outside the <T_0> , stre@@ t@@ ching <T_3> into all <T_2> very de@@ gra@@ ded lands .
so , that &apos;s sort of to put <T_1> in <T_0> here .

and <T_4> were <T_0> much just <T_1> with interest <T_3> people <T_6> wanted a <T_2> that they could build <T_5> open ro@@ v themselves .
and one of <T_0> things <T_9> &apos;s really <T_5> us is <T_3> emotions are not separate <T_1> reason , but <T_2> are the <T_8> of reason <T_7> they tell <T_4> what <T_6> value .
<T_0> only <T_4> they &apos;re missing <T_3> that it <T_5> a good <T_1> to <T_2> us going .

scre@@ w you . go <T_1> the back <T_9> the <T_2> and <T_7> else <T_3> do it , and <T_6> when <T_0> figure out that <T_5> works , <T_4> can join <T_8> well .
<T_1> , what <T_0> it for ?
our <T_3> is to introduce <T_7> whole new real@@ m of human interaction so <T_2> computers <T_5> understand <T_4> only what <T_6> direct it to <T_0> , but <T_1> can also respond to your fac@@ ial expres@@ sions <T_9> emotional <T_8> .

they <T_1> &apos;t necessarily <T_4> have to go into <T_2> kind of for@@ mal <T_0> to <T_3> it .
so <T_4> important <T_1> principle is <T_2> find ways <T_3> bringing technologies together <T_0> sym@@ bio@@ tic <T_5> .
and so <T_8> &apos;s <T_4> for us <T_9> think intelle@@ ctu@@ ally about <T_5> the life of the <T_6> is , and especially <T_7> who <T_0> very <T_3> -- we <T_1> play this <T_2> in our head .

is <T_3> hi@@ ja@@ b <T_0> the <T_4> a <T_2> of sub@@ mission <T_1> resi@@ stance ?
<T_9> we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s <T_6> possible link <T_5> other <T_2> . <T_3> &apos;d be <T_0> if <T_1> and be@@ es thought <T_7> , since <T_4> seem so different <T_8> us .
anyway <T_0> women <T_2> in <T_1> of an x-ray device .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sta@@ ying in <T_0> hotel <T_1> .
in <T_4> , <T_5> years of <T_1> , <T_3> saw <T_6> ful@@ l-@@ scale res@@ ur@@ gen@@ ce of <T_2> in au@@ gu@@ st , <T_0> .
in fact , as <T_4> looked into her <T_1> , <T_5> to my <T_0> that it &apos;s not <T_6> <T_3> for you or me to put a tracking device on <T_2> else &apos;s car .
<T_4> is a photo that i made showing <T_1> of these pu@@ ps that &apos;s only about <T_8> or seven <T_3> old -- still has a little <T_9> of the um@@ bili@@ cal cor@@ d <T_6> its bel@@ ly -- that has fallen in because of <T_7> thin <T_2> , and <T_0> mother is fran@@ tically trying to push it up to brea@@ the and to get it <T_5> to st@@ able pur@@ ch@@ ase .

so i work in <T_0> , <T_1> i <T_9> , but <T_6> first passion <T_5> physics , a <T_3> brought to me by a <T_4> school teacher , when <T_8> had a little <T_2> gra@@ y <T_7> .
and so <T_1> of my <T_7> sitting right <T_5> in front of me , ra@@ v@@ i <T_2> from <T_6> , <T_4> he &apos;s going to take it <T_3> over the <T_0> .
<T_1> was so <T_0> .
and the <T_2> say , <T_1> , <T_0> bas@@ ket@@ ball &#91; cour@@ ts &#93; .
<T_1> you feel the <T_0> ?
you can &apos;t mis@@ s <T_2> when i <T_1> you <T_0> &apos;s there .
<T_2> started it just <T_0> weeks <T_1> .
<T_1> are <T_0> seeing ?
<T_1> &apos;s like <T_0> .
<T_9> i <T_7> not <T_2> when i s@@ ang , and as <T_1> came up from my <T_8> , through my vo@@ cal <T_3> and passed <T_5> li@@ ps as <T_6> , it was the <T_0> thing <T_4> had ever come to tran@@ scen@@ dence .
then i would go <T_1> and deliver them to <T_2> 7@@ 0-@@ year-old <T_0> playing bridge .
extremely , extremely <T_0> .
<T_2> see a white <T_1> . <T_0> &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing , a soft <T_3> .
<T_3> , <T_0> , all the <T_1> we don &apos;t <T_2> anymore .
now , there &apos;s another <T_6> ac@@ id , cap@@ ric ac@@ id , <T_4> is <T_2> like the other <T_3> , <T_1> that it <T_5> two more carbon <T_0> .
so i &apos;m watching <T_3> behavior <T_2> the class@@ room , and <T_7> do i <T_0> ? <T_6> notice <T_4> m@@ ba students really <T_1> the <T_8> range <T_5> power <T_9> .
<T_3> , who <T_0> &apos;t <T_5> yet ? because <T_4> &apos;s really n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty -- <T_1> said <T_2> had to .
<T_3> think <T_7> without <T_8> being able <T_6> name it , we are <T_9> experi@@ encing that we &apos;ve come as <T_0> as we <T_2> with <T_5> as <T_4> only gui@@ ding <T_1> .
today <T_2> want to <T_1> on <T_3> we can do <T_0> individuals .
this <T_1> the ex@@ tent of the work that &apos;s to <T_2> comple@@ ted <T_0> 2010 .
mal@@ col@@ m <T_5> wrote an article <T_8> the new <T_1> on <T_4> , and <T_6> made the case that <T_2> disco@@ ver@@ ies are <T_0> the <T_3> of one <T_7> &apos;s geni@@ us .
<T_4> for <T_0> , this is <T_2> google <T_1> of the <T_3> conference .
<T_1> magne@@ ts are in <T_0> .
and <T_2> is <T_1> wonderful <T_0> there .
<T_1> mean , is <T_2> a scale to it , at the <T_0> scale , or ... ?
<T_2> &apos;s interesting <T_5> that <T_3> out of <T_4> would look at <T_0> marsh@@ mal@@ low and go like <T_1> ...
<T_1> has <T_0> chimpanze@@ es .
you <T_5> one of these bal@@ lot <T_8> at <T_0> , and then you <T_6> into the <T_7> , and you <T_1> your <T_2> , <T_3> you te@@ ar along <T_4> perfor@@ ation .
<T_0> truck they go <T_1> tour with .
<T_8> don &apos;t <T_3> know why <T_6> make me s@@ low <T_2> , <T_9> something <T_7> me like <T_1> mag@@ net and then i ignore <T_0> the others , and <T_5> just go <T_4> that pain@@ ting .
<T_1> was an <T_0> up@@ bringing , <T_9> as a <T_5> on <T_3> streets of <T_2> york , <T_7> learn how to <T_8> your own instin@@ cts , you learn how <T_4> go with your own <T_6> .
this <T_0> cru@@ cial <T_4> for <T_2> the <T_3> is going to do in the <T_1> .
<T_8> you can start to get the <T_0> arti@@ stic dire@@ ctors , scen@@ ic designers <T_2> ac@@ tors <T_1> around the <T_7> to come to <T_4> here <T_3> you can <T_5> things you can &apos;t do <T_6> .
i <T_0> you <T_1> designing your <T_4> ultimate <T_3> worst possible <T_2> .
on the <T_0> facing <T_4> street it &apos;s much more <T_2> , except i <T_5> a few <T_7> down , so that coming <T_6> the <T_8> , these <T_9> made a <T_3> to the <T_1> .
<T_5> here &apos;s the <T_1> al@@ ar@@ ming <T_0> : <T_4> don &apos;t fully understand the long-term <T_3> of multiple <T_2> .
so he <T_0> back to <T_2> farm , <T_6> , <T_1> story <T_5> , they now have <T_3> ac@@ res <T_4> .
at 15 <T_0> i was suffering major <T_1> de@@ pri@@ vation to the <T_2> .
<T_4> agree <T_0> pain@@ t@@ ings or movies <T_6> music are beautiful because <T_3> cultures deter@@ mine <T_5> uni@@ form@@ ity <T_2> aes@@ thetic <T_1> .
<T_2> they <T_1> che@@ ated in <T_0> very , very serious way .
so this <T_1> not <T_0> zer@@ o-@@ sum game in anyway .
in <T_1> , they have <T_0> phrase called <T_2> .
<T_2> was <T_1> south indian brought up <T_0> ben@@ gal .
<T_4> bu@@ yer <T_3> ki@@ p <T_5> , son of <T_0> of the most fl@@ am@@ bo@@ y@@ ant <T_2> of the 20th <T_1> .
and for <T_0> as a <T_3> , i felt proud . i felt <T_2> &apos;d <T_1> a little .
now , when your eye moves <T_9> eye <T_4> eye , if there <T_6> something <T_2> there like , a <T_0> , you &apos;d <T_7> a <T_3> where <T_1> eye is supposed to be , and you &apos;d go , <T_8> sh@@ it , you know -- there &apos;s something <T_5> about this person .
<T_1> talked <T_0> , what , <T_2> weeks ago , something like that .
where <T_1> the <T_0> countries ? <T_3> can <T_2> you africa .
so , here you go .
<T_0> can improve health , and it can play a part in reducing , if not <T_2> , <T_1> .
<T_1> psych@@ ologists mar@@ gar@@ et <T_2> and john <T_3> studied <T_0> with high and low <T_4> .
<T_0> : almost <T_1> .
but <T_4> on the actual -- <T_8> know , being able <T_1> talk <T_5> them , <T_3> to <T_0> their <T_2> , this is what it looks like in <T_6> of the <T_7> .
and <T_8> said , &quot; look , i think i &apos;ll sc@@ are <T_0> grandmother to <T_5> , <T_1> i actually <T_7> to her and tell her <T_3> you &apos;re <T_9> to adop@@ t her , <T_2> want to go back <T_6> talk to <T_4> . &quot;
one <T_9> who was watching our <T_2> in <T_8> about five <T_6> ago -- <T_3> place which <T_0> er@@ adi@@ cated <T_7> , not once , <T_1> twice , <T_4> they got <T_5> .
nothing can do that . and i talk next . i showed <T_2> this video with <T_8> simple <T_9> of rhe@@ x here . and <T_3> to convince them we should <T_5> to <T_7> in 2011 , <T_0> tin@@ ted the video or@@ ange <T_6> to give them <T_1> sense of being on <T_4> .
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> bi@@ gel@@ o@@ w who <T_0> running it until <T_5> when the <T_4> was offici@@ ally <T_1> off .
so , how do we make and <T_0> metaph@@ ors ?
i photographed <T_3> at the <T_1> of the <T_2> at the sna@@ ke <T_0> in <T_4> .
<T_2> is <T_4> consum@@ ers working <T_5> to <T_3> what <T_0> want out of the <T_1> .
this <T_0> an <T_3> bicycle tube , <T_1> gives you a <T_2> band , two safety p@@ ins <T_4>

<T_2> they can feed <T_0> information back to <T_6> sub@@ scri@@ bers , <T_1> only to their sub@@ scri@@ bers <T_4> the <T_3> highway <T_7> behind the <T_5> ja@@ m !
it <T_8> sense , right ? <T_4> &apos;s open space , <T_6> planes <T_2> take off <T_0> land <T_5> wor@@ r@@ ying about <T_1> noise <T_3> avo@@ i@@ ding t@@ all <T_7> .

<T_1> who are <T_0> biggest <T_2> ?
<T_1> tries to <T_0> people .
we <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> little <T_1> has been a <T_2> .
<T_0> : so tab@@ o@@ o number <T_3> : you can &apos;t talk <T_6> your <T_4> -- <T_2> today i &apos;ll <T_5> about <T_1> .
<T_0> gor@@ don : <T_2> death of innovation , <T_3> end <T_1> growth
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> dangerous , but i <T_4> it &apos;s <T_6> to have dangerous <T_5> in the open <T_1> think you &apos;re going to <T_0> .
and <T_6> in <T_3> to get 15 percent of it <T_5> the plant , all <T_7> rest is <T_4> , we <T_0> to add <T_2> and <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s pretty <T_2> for the <T_1> .
<T_1> work with <T_0> .
<T_7> , <T_4> to@@ aster <T_0> huge because <T_6> used to make to@@ ast <T_3> open fir@@ es , and <T_1> took a <T_2> of time and <T_5> .
<T_2> , <T_3> used the same bla@@ d@@ der@@ -@@ in@@ fl@@ ated <T_1> , and we took <T_0> for testing .
you <T_0> see here , <T_2> small <T_3> domin@@ ate the <T_1> .
that &apos;s the qu@@ est .
<T_6> if <T_5> invol@@ ve them <T_9> their education , <T_3> we have them discuss the <T_0> issues that they con@@ front -- that our whole <T_4> con@@ fron@@ ts -- and if we give <T_2> skills that enable <T_1> to engage the real world , <T_7> magic will <T_8> .
so <T_1> optimis@@ m can lead to ris@@ ky <T_4> , <T_0> financial <T_2> , to fau@@ l@@ ty <T_3> .
<T_1> , am <T_2> saying <T_3> there are du@@ mb <T_0> working here ?
that the chinese <T_3> pas@@ ses <T_0> u.s. economy in , let &apos;s say , <T_9> , which it <T_7> it , that <T_6> be a measure <T_2> total economic <T_8> , but not of per <T_1> income -- <T_4> &apos;t tell you <T_5> the com@@ position of the economy .

<T_1> that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to <T_0> you .
so <T_8> &apos;s <T_5> interesting , <T_6> it <T_2> sense in a way , <T_9> they &apos;re still <T_3> , <T_7> why <T_1> they be getting diseases of <T_4> until their <T_0> ?
now , talk of <T_0> divided place -- the country <T_1> cut in <T_2> .
and that needs to be <T_1> , first of all , <T_0> peac@@ e@@ keeping <T_2> .
another <T_2> proper@@ ty is <T_1> it flo@@ ws with absolutely <T_3> vis@@ co@@ sity or <T_8> , so if <T_6> were to take the <T_0> off that <T_5> , <T_7> won &apos;t stay <T_4> .
<T_8> they should make <T_5> that when you walk <T_0> a museum -- <T_9> i was <T_1> museum cur@@ ator , <T_4> would make a <T_2> for <T_6> , <T_7> room for <T_3> .
<T_2> you look <T_1> this , just <T_0> tube , it <T_3> quite <T_4> .

it &apos;s going to <T_2> be organic <T_4> conventional <T_1> some <T_3> of the two to <T_0> that .
people i know who are fire@@ men <T_1> me that <T_2> is <T_0> un@@ common .

<T_0> is a point <T_1> .
in <T_0> experience , in <T_2> , the light footprint was <T_1> hel@@ p@@ ful .
<T_3> that <T_1> , he asked to be <T_2> into <T_0> wife .
i <T_2> the <T_1> of <T_0> family .
i look a <T_0> like mo@@ ses , or ted <T_1> .
<T_8> do trans@@ national <T_3> organi@@ zations succeed where democra@@ tic mov@@ ements <T_2> a <T_4> time taking hold ? ma@@ a@@ j@@ id na@@ wa@@ z , a <T_1> islam@@ ist extrem@@ ist , as@@ ks for <T_7> gras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots stories <T_9> global social activ@@ ism to <T_6> democracy in the face of <T_5> and x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . <T_0> powerful talk from ted@@ global 2011 .
so <T_0> many hours of <T_1> day does that take ?
all <T_6> you need <T_7> do , <T_9> that the <T_3> need to do , <T_2> to move this <T_5> into <T_0> that is <T_8> so <T_1> the operation <T_4> be made more efficient .
<T_2> new <T_4> for the <T_3> that we <T_0> of under@@ taking this <T_1> .
and <T_6> idea <T_3> to put mc@@ sweeney &apos;s -- mc@@ sweeney &apos;s <T_5> , that we <T_8> twice <T_9> three <T_7> a year , and a <T_0> other maga@@ zin@@ es -- we <T_2> going to move it into <T_4> office for the <T_1> time .
<T_3> heard <T_1> now from <T_4> east again the war <T_0> , and it &apos;s going <T_2> .
<T_1> you want <T_4> choose to pun@@ ch <T_0> pun@@ ch card <T_3> , you <T_2> age <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;s go back <T_1> traditional <T_0> .
<T_0> about <T_1> they &apos;re <T_3> going <T_2> a lot .
i mean , <T_5> &apos;s <T_0> nice top@@ ic <T_4> a <T_1> or at the <T_2> machine , but to share this among <T_3> pe@@ ers is <T_6> different <T_7>
so <T_1> do <T_3> get sam@@ ples from <T_0> your genetic <T_2> ?
<T_0> hil@@ ton would have been <T_1> to <T_5> one of these things around <T_2> a little hand@@ ba@@ g , until <T_3> drop cro@@ c land@@ ed on <T_4> .
i &apos;ve been <T_0> the <T_1> .
you <T_4> , <T_6> &apos;ve heard <T_9> this <T_0> -- <T_8> roman@@ tic <T_1> of the l@@ one <T_5> with the &quot; <T_3> ! &quot; moment that changes the <T_2> is <T_7> .
now in <T_3> case , although <T_0> wasn &apos;t <T_5> , we could <T_1> actually <T_2> the <T_4> of the students .
<T_0> you .
if <T_2> have money , of <T_0> , you <T_1> get the value .
so we don &apos;t know <T_9> much <T_8> the <T_6> of viol@@ ini@@ sts <T_2> we do <T_3> that when <T_0> enter@@ ed <T_5> state of <T_1> jer@@ se@@ y <T_4> is an up@@ ti@@ ck in <T_7> .
<T_8> the <T_1> little <T_3> from this is <T_6> leaders need to be <T_0> to talk all the <T_4> so that you <T_5> touch <T_7> person in <T_2> .
these <T_0> an operation called <T_2> , a cyber@@ crime operation <T_4> which <T_3> ne@@ tt@@ ed <T_1> .
<T_2> thought , <T_1> a great way to get <T_0> school .
<T_0> , you <T_2> an am@@ pli@@ fication <T_3> the lab , <T_4> then <T_5> get it <T_1> self-@@ assem@@ ble <T_6> a structure like a <T_7> .
<T_1> of this effort <T_0> in an <T_2> object .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> un@@ professional and <T_1> .
<T_0> said , &quot; yeah , hey , it &apos;s <T_2> . <T_4> , <T_3> sul@@ fu@@ r &apos;s <T_1> .
so we <T_1> them to be able to do <T_3> separate words , to <T_2> out <T_0> proper@@ ly .
and <T_4> basically live <T_8> life <T_5> sort of a trance , and i <T_2> around <T_3> everything i <T_6> is just <T_0> beginning of <T_1> long <T_7> .
and <T_0> it <T_4> , <T_5> working with both positive and <T_3> space <T_1> also with <T_2> cur@@ ves .

at <T_2> , we were <T_0> in <T_1> camp .
<T_2> &apos;ve left out <T_1> and a bunch of <T_0> things .

<T_0> of you <T_1> probably used this .
thank you .
actually , the idea <T_0> out of <T_7> argument <T_1> i had <T_4> star@@ bucks , <T_3> i insi@@ sted <T_6> i wasn &apos;t having <T_2> coffee ; the <T_5> was actually pre@@ -@@ colum@@ bi@@ an .

<T_4> if you think about it , <T_5> my <T_1> to <T_3> hands <T_0> his <T_2> .
<T_0> were <T_4> born into <T_1> they pro@@ ac@@ tively surro@@ unded themselves <T_2> the <T_3> people .
<T_8> still are an <T_3> arro@@ gant <T_5> of people , i <T_2> as@@ sure <T_0> , but they &apos;re now <T_1> about their <T_9> , and <T_7> , too , see <T_6> tremendous range of potential <T_4> .
<T_3> i <T_0> that , in <T_2> to know where i was going , <T_1> had to know where i &apos;d been .
i <T_1> this <T_2> got to be , in <T_3> , a building <T_0> problem .
<T_3> , you know , by <T_5> able to <T_0> a genome <T_7> plu@@ g it into <T_2> organis@@ m , <T_6> software , <T_1> you will , changes the <T_4> .
<T_6> what he says is , <T_0> often , is <T_4> this : <T_2> says , &quot; <T_8> tells <T_7> , he <T_5> me , <T_1> he <T_3> , that he had <T_9> brea@@ thing . &quot;
you know , eight <T_1> before <T_4> , <T_0> archite@@ cts <T_3> to get <T_2> building in on time , right ?
think <T_0> it . <T_4> bring it to <T_1> . <T_2> is <T_3> .

and <T_0> would be very <T_2> to get your <T_1> to this .

<T_0> you sing , please , the <T_1> no@@ te of <T_2> gi@@ o@@ van@@ n@@ i ?
it was 1.@@ 4@@ 8 .
<T_1> and <T_5> taken out of <T_0> in <T_7> i <T_8> the &quot; high@@ li@@ ghter version , &quot; which is <T_3> one favor@@ ed <T_2> both muslim fundament@@ ali@@ sts <T_6> anti-@@ muslim <T_4> .
what do i <T_0> ?
<T_4> what you might not <T_7> is <T_3> you &apos;re also <T_2> out a list <T_5> networks you &apos;ve <T_0> connected to , <T_1> when <T_8> &apos;re not using <T_6> ac@@ tively .
<T_0> up <T_2> specific to conc@@ ussion in <T_1> .
<T_3> it &apos;s <T_2> wonder <T_0> as we head into <T_4> writers &apos; stri@@ ke , odd <T_1> happen .
but <T_6> can go <T_4> about <T_5> you <T_9> we <T_7> stories , and how <T_0> effectively are <T_2> we <T_1> and how these get transl@@ ated into the <T_3> discipl@@ ine that i am in , which is <T_8> .
you <T_4> , we <T_5> all these <T_0> and i <T_7> we like our g@@ aps <T_3> they make us <T_6> like <T_8> identify with <T_2> , <T_1> smaller <T_9> .
what <T_2> didn &apos;t <T_6> was the <T_5> , <T_1> other uses <T_4> would evol@@ ve <T_0> this very simple <T_3> .
rhe@@ x &apos;s foot <T_1> off to be <T_5> simple , then it got <T_2> over <T_3> , <T_0> ultimately <T_6> in this half <T_4> .
<T_0> problem <T_1> he doesn &apos;t exist .
we <T_0> all look at <T_1> moon <T_2> bit more often . we don &apos;t .
<T_2> father had <T_1> in a <T_3> car accident , and he <T_0> .
this is <T_2> ma@@ ster@@ mind behind <T_8> eventu@@ al <T_3> of what we call the son@@ ny bon@@ o copy@@ right term <T_7> act , exten@@ ding <T_6> term <T_5> exi@@ sting copy@@ rights <T_1> 20 years , so <T_4> no one could do to <T_0> what dis@@ ney did to <T_9> brothers gri@@ mm .
<T_6> sure <T_3> knows <T_0> i got the answer <T_5> , <T_2> this is my <T_4> fin@@ ish , <T_1> .
<T_2> then <T_0> wir@@ es itself to the <T_1> .
<T_3> it <T_0> the it@@ ur@@ i forest <T_1> -- <T_2> 1,@@ 300 species of plants , so far <T_4> .
<T_3> more and <T_2> people <T_1> the <T_4> are taking them <T_0> term .
it &apos;s going towards <T_1> , not <T_0> india .
<T_0> : <T_2> the teachers , and that <T_1> really hard for the teachers .
<T_0> i <T_5> , &quot; <T_2> car here &apos;s <T_4> one <T_3> pla@@ te that &apos;s all <T_1> up . &quot;
this is why we <T_1> bon@@ uses to ban@@ kers <T_0> pay in all kinds of <T_2> .
<T_0> it &apos;s then being <T_1> open .
i <T_0> conne@@ ctions .
<T_2> i then <T_0> a <T_1> .
<T_2> , so <T_1> would <T_0> like to fin@@ ish ?
<T_3> one performance , i could <T_0> dra@@ g myself from the <T_1> to the <T_2> .
so <T_4> idea of <T_1> focused ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und to <T_0> les@@ i@@ ons in the brain <T_2> not <T_3> at all .
because in reality , what <T_3> want to do <T_1> you actually want to have the patient on <T_0> bed with the <T_2> , <T_4> you have a scan@@ ner , basically like a fl@@ at@@ bed scan@@ ner .
<T_5> you can <T_1> the <T_0> of an <T_4> there , because <T_2> can see the <T_3> &quot; new &quot; emerging <T_6> the &quot; old . &quot;
we <T_0> do <T_2> same for ge@@ other@@ mal <T_1> and <T_3> power .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> i didn &apos;t have a <T_0> to get in the <T_3> .
<T_2> have s@@ w@@ um in <T_1> of <T_3> which <T_0> re@@ treated so much .
<T_0> why <T_1> ?
<T_7> one <T_9> -- i don &apos;t know <T_4> happened -- <T_5> coming back from the office <T_3> home , maybe <T_1> saw <T_8> hon@@ ey bee <T_0> it occur@@ red <T_6> my mind that if i only <T_2> be like the hon@@ ey bee , life would be wonderful .
com@@ man@@ der : soldi@@ ers , you are <T_2> to fight <T_1> battle , so <T_4> must get ready <T_3> willing <T_0> die .
just moving <T_7> , <T_6> it possible , taking that idea <T_4> mind , body , bo@@ d@@ y-@@ building , to <T_8> the <T_3> body , <T_0> biological <T_9> , with <T_5> second , the <T_1> of architecture <T_2> the built environment .
<T_0> mean , <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> i heard <T_1> up .
yet <T_0> assu@@ mp@@ tions that <T_6> theory needs to make in <T_3> to <T_2> those <T_9> are <T_8> myster@@ ious that <T_1> feynman <T_5> was moved to re@@ mark , &quot; if you <T_7> you understand quantum theory , you don &apos;t understand <T_4> . &quot;
<T_1> really have <T_4> do work <T_2> figure out , <T_5> , one <T_3> &apos;s a thousand , 2,000 ; one <T_0> 1,500 .
<T_2> i <T_5> we <T_4> that love is <T_3> enough <T_0> us to get out there <T_1> try .
and <T_1> said , <T_0> , in the same way that they ex@@ u@@ de <T_3> protein and it starts <T_6> cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zation -- and then they <T_7> sort of <T_4> in -- <T_8> let go of a <T_2> that stop@@ s <T_5> cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zation .
see , i want <T_0> to think about just how <T_1> this <T_2> .
<T_3> , this fau@@ c@@ et <T_0> is just a <T_1> of o@@ sage <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;re looking <T_4> milli@@ meter accu@@ ra@@ cy with <T_7> to spa@@ tial and <T_1> accu@@ ra@@ cy using <T_8> s@@ qui@@ ds -- these are super@@ condu@@ cting <T_6> inter@@ ference <T_9> -- to <T_2> up the magnetic fields that change <T_5> we do <T_0> thinking .
<T_1> ? it can happen in <T_0> stock <T_2> .
<T_1> it is <T_3> story of <T_2> and <T_0> against im@@ prob@@ abilities .
and <T_0> believe <T_2> &apos;s because technology appe@@ als to <T_1> most <T_3> we are <T_4> vulnerable .
<T_2> she was horri@@ fied <T_4> get there and <T_0> that they <T_1> &apos;t have a <T_3> .
in fact , most of the people studying biol@@ umines@@ cence today are focused <T_0> the <T_8> , <T_2> these chemicals <T_6> pro@@ ved so incredibly valuable for developing <T_1> ag@@ ents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life <T_9> mars , <T_7> pollu@@ tan@@ ts in our <T_4> -- <T_5> is how we use it <T_3> or@@ ca .
and that isn &apos;t <T_0> they don &apos;t <T_2> to , it &apos;s really because they <T_1> &apos;t .
<T_0> in <T_7> non-@@ muslim communities of <T_2> middle east , such <T_5> some <T_1> communities , <T_6> communities , <T_4> see the same <T_3> .
<T_3> were tran@@ scen@@ ding <T_2> space <T_0> the mind and the <T_1> .
<T_4> felt , when <T_5> had my <T_3> , <T_6> i was holding <T_1> to something <T_7> , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less <T_0> agen@@ das <T_2> politics .
that <T_2> we keep putting <T_7> , through industrial <T_3> urban <T_5> , back into the <T_4> -- <T_6> we keep doing <T_1> -- we <T_0> continue on .
<T_1> they &apos;re <T_6> ke@@ en <T_0> we don &apos;t let money drop <T_3> that <T_4> , <T_5> it turns into <T_2> like this .
the <T_5> news <T_7> that <T_2> same <T_4> that <T_6> mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation of <T_0> is now allo@@ wing us <T_3> mini@@ at@@ uri@@ ze <T_1> laborat@@ ories .
there i &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
<T_0> you .
and i will say , though , <T_1> museum <T_0> gor@@ geous .
not <T_0> ten <T_1> .
<T_2> do you cross <T_1> legs in <T_0> san@@ e <T_3> ?
i built , along with <T_4> two <T_8> , the <T_9> real <T_5> in <T_0> home state , ker@@ al@@ a , and then worked <T_7> <T_3> of <T_1> &apos;s biggest <T_2> , but in <T_6> star@@ tu@@ p enter@@ pris@@ es .
so <T_1> went on and we looked in <T_0> , we <T_2> this <T_3> .
<T_1> , <T_2> yours ? <T_0> .
he <T_1> he <T_3> hours <T_0> various in@@ ton@@ ations to <T_4> used <T_2> the voice .
it &apos;s why <T_0> leave <T_2> on around <T_1> house .
but <T_1> is not <T_3> to bring them <T_0> our <T_2> .
<T_6> per@@ chance , if you <T_4> always keep <T_5> picture in your <T_1> , <T_8> when we <T_0> maybe in <T_3> dist@@ ant future , in <T_9> , <T_7> picture will <T_2> very different .
<T_4> &apos;m a <T_7> ; <T_6> am <T_1> &apos; wrong . &apos; what <T_0> you going to tell <T_2> about <T_5> and <T_3> ? &quot;
<T_4> bought <T_2> bright red <T_5> g@@ hi@@ a <T_1> the <T_3> she made working at bur@@ ger <T_0> .
and <T_3> approach this <T_1> by consi@@ dering <T_2> curi@@ ous <T_0> called phan@@ tom limb .
<T_2> i took <T_4> bi@@ te out <T_0> it , you &apos;d <T_3> , &quot; <T_1> a second .
yes , there is a need for us to find a cure <T_2> hiv , to find an <T_9> vac@@ cine for <T_0> , to find a diagno@@ stic tool that works for t@@ .b. , but i <T_6> that <T_5> o@@ we it to those who will@@ ingly <T_3> sel@@ fl@@ ess@@ ly con@@ sent to <T_8> in <T_4> clinical tri@@ als to do <T_7> in <T_1> human@@ e way .
so <T_5> thing <T_3> i took from home <T_4> this <T_1> that <T_0> don &apos;t <T_2> have to teach .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> been too much <T_0> him .
this is why we <T_4> our <T_8> talking <T_7> things like <T_3> marriage and <T_1> about genoci@@ de <T_0> nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation <T_6> poverty <T_5> any other <T_2> issue .
<T_1> &apos;re living through <T_2> of those <T_0> .
we don &apos;t <T_2> to show the <T_0> with the par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a <T_1> no <T_3> no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
thir@@ dly , <T_0> .
we <T_1> the <T_2> : a <T_3> connected to <T_0> ; <T_5> is connected to <T_4> .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;d <T_3> to talk <T_0> and really , <T_4> do we get from <T_5> we are now to <T_1> we <T_2> to go ?
of <T_5> the political <T_0> in the world has been very <T_1> , <T_3> the <T_2> against each other into <T_6> , very <T_4> ideas .
<T_5> that is <T_1> , it <T_2> to some <T_4> complicated questions <T_3> the london <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ll <T_0> everyone &apos;s good <T_2> .
<T_8> , <T_0> like gar@@ den-@@ share , that mat@@ ches up <T_7> who don &apos;t have a garden who <T_3> like <T_4> grow <T_5> , with <T_9> <T_1> have gar@@ den@@ s <T_6> aren &apos;t using <T_2> .
<T_1> area is called experiment@@ al econom@@ ics . <T_0> other area is called behavi@@ oral econom@@ ics .
<T_2> it <T_0> out <T_1> were <T_3> un@@ popular .
so , <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> sol@@ ved <T_4> , that particular <T_2> is <T_3> .
so <T_0> is <T_4> reason , <T_1> structural <T_6> , why we get stuck <T_5> this <T_2> of <T_3> .
this <T_2> a huge <T_5> on <T_6> mind , <T_7> i am <T_1> woman and <T_4> am <T_3> mother , and i hadn &apos;t realized <T_9> the <T_8> / aids pande@@ mic was directly affe@@ cting women in <T_0> a way .
<T_1> is <T_3> , one is <T_0> . that must be <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;m also <T_0> in birds . <T_2> i &apos;m <T_5> with <T_3> fellow . this <T_4> a <T_6> special bird .
<T_4> : <T_0> , <T_6> was a little <T_1> , <T_5> all i had to work with <T_2> a <T_3> and a tri@@ c@@ ep .
the one <T_4> the <T_3> system <T_5> in order to begin <T_0> the <T_2> is dynamic <T_1> .
you &apos;re <T_2> through the <T_0> of <T_3> colleagu@@ e &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_1> i <T_4> you to think of <T_2> sym@@ b@@ ols and their <T_0> , <T_5> come to your <T_3> immediately .
<T_0> , so <T_2> &apos;ll <T_3> you <T_1> save it , and res@@ cu@@ e it .
<T_3> must be <T_0> extraordinary , an <T_1> to the <T_2> .
and <T_3> i think we &apos;re ready to t@@ ack@@ le <T_1> of the most <T_5> questions in <T_0> : how <T_6> the <T_7> of <T_4> and <T_2> different ?
i actually <T_2> that with <T_1> leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors <T_0> in <T_3> u.s .
because they <T_1> also a <T_0> of <T_2> .
<T_0> cle@@ an@@ er <T_2> into <T_1> sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue .
<T_1> inter@@ ior of <T_2> is <T_0> the right .
it <T_0> ab@@ undance , as <T_1> to <T_2> .
and <T_1> can move forward <T_3> there , and <T_0> get <T_2> .
<T_0> there <T_4> almost <T_2> we can <T_3> about it , asi@@ de from taking a <T_1> and <T_5> to <T_6> it .
they have <T_0> sophi@@ st@@ icated co@@ operation .
<T_1> them to help <T_0> .
the <T_0> was absolutely <T_1> .
<T_1> few <T_2> out 100,000 dollars <T_0> .
so <T_3> again , <T_1> do <T_2> take these <T_4> ris@@ ks with <T_0> preci@@ ous ?
<T_1> happens <T_4> that <T_2> second this <T_0> of in@@ cen@@ tive gets <T_7> so that instead <T_5> asking , &quot; what <T_3> my <T_6> ? &quot;
the <T_0> are happy , <T_1> they <T_2> it .
make <T_2> apps , <T_0> you <T_1> .
thank <T_0> .
<T_1> like <T_0> .
just <T_1> bit <T_0> or@@ nam@@ ent@@ al .
<T_2> you <T_3> &apos;t believe it , but <T_4> one after that is <T_1> called the <T_0> large telescope .
<T_1> most people <T_0> ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan as <T_2> emerging ge@@ o@@ political <T_3> . <T_4> ?
<T_2> the other hand , we &apos;re working with <T_3> ha@@ th@@ away , war@@ ren <T_4> and <T_6> car@@ pet , <T_0> largest car@@ pet <T_5> in the <T_1> .
<T_3> can be <T_1> . it <T_0> reve@@ al quite aston@@ ishing <T_2> .
this <T_1> a <T_0> with 50,000 <T_2> .
<T_1> of all , <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> linear proje@@ ction .
i <T_5> banking on you <T_6> i &apos;m banking <T_3> guys like <T_0> and qu@@ in@@ cy <T_7> hack@@ ett and richard and <T_4> de@@ cent <T_1> who <T_2> believe in <T_8> .
<T_0> , the <T_1> union is <T_2> trans@@ fer@@ ring aid .
and so , there &apos;s <T_3> interesting <T_2> on <T_0> , at least of that <T_4> .
<T_6> i was <T_0> up , <T_2> dad used <T_1> love telling <T_3> story of <T_5> first day <T_4> canada .
<T_2> ? <T_0> google would <T_1> this .
so again <T_2> is <T_1> they can see <T_0> the <T_3> .
<T_2> , <T_4> are <T_0> reasons , and you <T_1> some of them in the <T_3> talk <T_5> .
<T_3> you can <T_1> them working <T_0> all parts of the <T_2> .
and so <T_1> met dr. son@@ o <T_0> in <T_2> .
<T_7> &apos;ve made a fascinating <T_6> : there &apos;s nothing <T_5> with <T_1> kids <T_3> affe@@ ction and <T_4> and food <T_0> enthusias@@ m <T_2> her@@ bie &apos;s <T_8> can &apos;t <T_9> .
probably <T_0> .
and <T_0> has <T_1> dna .
and then <T_4> -- i know <T_2> other name -- <T_9> us <T_3> inter@@ connection , and how we &apos;re <T_1> totally <T_6> here , and how we &apos;ve all known <T_0> other . and of course in the buddh@@ ist universe , we &apos;ve already <T_7> this already billions of times in many , many <T_8> in the <T_5> .
no , <T_9> i want to do is take you back to <T_5> in london <T_4> the next few minutes , <T_7> tell the story -- in brie@@ f -- of this out@@ break , <T_3> in many ways , i think , helped create the world that <T_2> live <T_6> today , <T_0> particularly <T_8> kind <T_1> city that we live in today .
<T_2> wasn &apos;t the <T_5> man who suff@@ ered <T_0> a pre@@ -@@ civil <T_3> america , and <T_6> certainly wasn &apos;t <T_7> only <T_4> or@@ ator of <T_1> day .

<T_9> &apos;re moving <T_0> what i would think of as a fully connected <T_3> , and we have global decisions to make in this system , decisions <T_7> climate , about finance systems , about <T_8> . and think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about <T_1> a house , <T_6> don &apos;t just <T_4> off . i mean , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to see a lot of houses <T_5> i put that <T_2> money into it .

you couldn &apos;t really do <T_1> crime , <T_0> .
researchers <T_1> long known that <T_0> more intelligent the <T_5> , <T_2> larger the ne@@ o@@ cortex , the more likely it <T_3> to be <T_4> .
<T_1> solution is <T_0> source .
&quot; <T_2> i &apos;d get to see <T_1> in <T_3> . &quot; &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
<T_2> they <T_6> people who were not <T_3> of <T_5> , or <T_4> or energy , <T_1> they had no <T_7> , no <T_0> , <T_8> pro@@ spe@@ cts .
now , <T_1> are one-@@ second <T_0> of music .
i &apos;ve <T_1> a <T_0> right here .
<T_4> is <T_3> mc@@ g@@ ill and university of mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an . <T_0> is <T_2> rhe@@ x , making <T_5> first <T_6> in <T_1> demo .
<T_6> so what i have felt -- <T_2> i have looked at <T_9> from <T_4> national security issue -- when i was secre@@ tary of state , i decided that women &apos;s issues had to be central to american foreign policy , not just because <T_0> &apos;m a femin@@ ist , but because i believe <T_8> societies are <T_5> off when women are <T_3> and econom@@ ically em@@ powered , that <T_7> are passed down , the health situation is better , education is better , there is greater <T_1> .
and so i <T_1> , &quot; here &apos;s <T_3> problem that just <T_0> out for a <T_6> system -- not <T_4> like <T_9> one , but one like <T_8> one -- because , func@@ tionally , a skelet@@ on is any <T_5> that suppor@@ ts <T_2> and <T_7> forces .
<T_9> we count <T_1> the will@@ ing@@ ness <T_0> drug companies to make <T_7> happen . we count <T_2> those companies that <T_8> that it is in the interest , <T_6> only in the interest of the global good , but also in their own <T_4> , to move from <T_5> to collabor@@ ation , and through <T_3> medi@@ cin@@ es patent pool they can make that happen .
and <T_1> military inter@@ vention is <T_0> .
<T_8> deep , for instance , was <T_6> lincoln &apos;s <T_2> of <T_3> , <T_0> he made time to spend more <T_4> a hundred <T_9> in the <T_7> , even <T_1> those <T_5> days of the war .
<T_3> always , when i &apos;m on tv , <T_1> produ@@ cers <T_5> call <T_2> , who negoti@@ ate <T_4> we &apos;re going to say , is <T_0> woman .
<T_3> &apos;s this <T_7> who got <T_5> 3@@ 4@@ -@@ year head <T_0> thinking about the kinds of questions <T_2> as a <T_9> are gra@@ p@@ pling with , <T_4> as citizens are gra@@ p@@ pling <T_8> now . <T_6> do we take <T_1> ?
i think knowing <T_5> is a <T_0> useful <T_2> within <T_4> we can think <T_3> our <T_1> .
but <T_1> when we compare <T_4> the possible , instead of <T_3> past , we <T_0> make certain <T_2> of <T_5> .
<T_1> saw the <T_0> going in .
and <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> or <T_3> different comp@@ il@@ ations there , but <T_7> one of those <T_1> refle@@ cts in@@ put <T_0> hundreds of these kinds of <T_2> from <T_6> .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> tried to turn <T_3> into an electrical engineering <T_1> .
<T_5> they <T_0> strate@@ gi@@ es <T_6> keep from <T_3> , <T_4> things that nu@@ dge them <T_1> from the <T_2> at the right time .
and <T_1> have had a <T_5> who said <T_4> very thing , and <T_2> a <T_0> right after that , which <T_6> quite <T_3> .
but it <T_0> the <T_1> that the <T_2> have .
you <T_3> , once <T_0> have <T_5> of those <T_4> points , <T_2> can make <T_6> easy <T_1> investor@@ s .
<T_2> . <T_0> goes to this lady here <T_1>
<T_2> the good news <T_3> today <T_6> are tac@@ kl@@ ing <T_1> big issues , of <T_4> and the <T_0> -- not <T_5> at <T_8> , but really <T_7> an industry .
<T_3> we <T_6> learn to land on these <T_5> that have our <T_7> on them <T_2> put something like <T_1> small i@@ on pro@@ pul@@ sion <T_0> on it , which would g@@ ently , slowly , after a period of time , push <T_4> into a different traject@@ ory , which , if we &apos;ve done our math right , would <T_9> it <T_8> hit@@ ting earth .
<T_1> people are <T_4> 9@@ .@@ 3 hours <T_2> day , <T_3> is more <T_0> we &apos;re <T_5> , at 7@@ .@@ 7 <T_6> .
next , i do 5@@ 7 squ@@ ared , which is 3@@ ,@@ 249 , so i can say , three <T_8> . <T_7> the 249 , add that to co@@ okie , 249 , <T_4> , but i see a <T_2> coming -- 249 -- add that to co@@ okie , 250 <T_6> 7@@ 7 , <T_5> 3@@ 2@@ 7 million -- fis@@ sion , fis@@ sion , ok , finally , we do 6@@ 8@@ 3 squ@@ ared , that &apos;s 7@@ 00 times 6@@ 6@@ 6 , <T_1> 17 squ@@ ared <T_0> 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 9 , re@@ v up if i need it , re@@ v up , <T_3> the 4@@ 6@@ 6 , add that to fis@@ sion , to get , oh <T_9> -- 3@@ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 9 .
people were <T_2> cur@@ ing cancer <T_1> building <T_0> .
but <T_7> must <T_3> , <T_6> whole thing about <T_8> slightly <T_2> all the time , <T_5> is what -- <T_1> think that is a very <T_0> thing for <T_4> fashi@@ on designer .
<T_7> of my interest <T_4> this , <T_3> have to <T_8> , is that i would like to -- <T_1> do <T_2> put this <T_5> ? -- <T_0> the way , <T_9> maybe ev@@ is@@ cer@@ ate , the capital structure of the u.s. health care system , which i think is <T_6> broken .
you <T_2> , this <T_3> is involved as we &apos;ve <T_4> heard , in <T_0> great <T_1> .
<T_3> you <T_2> , <T_4> every star@@ bucks that you <T_1> also get <T_0> ?
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> on ?
sam har@@ ris : <T_8> , well <T_5> think <T_0> tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , watching the <T_2> ti@@ cking , but the <T_6> is : what is volun@@ tary <T_7> a <T_1> where men have <T_3> expec@@ tations , <T_4> you &apos;re guaran@@ te@@ ed to be treated in <T_9> certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ eil yourself ?
but <T_0> won &apos;t come to us <T_1> through <T_2> .
so <T_1> &apos;m <T_0> going to <T_2> that in there .
<T_1> , proble@@ m-@@ solving and <T_2> on . <T_3> &apos;s an <T_0> place .
he <T_1> , &quot; <T_4> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_5> things <T_3> &apos;d like you to <T_0> .
<T_4> of the <T_0> things <T_2> our invol@@ v@@ ement <T_1> afghanistan is <T_6> we &apos;ve got our <T_5> out <T_3> syn@@ c .
and <T_1> an enormous accident took <T_0> .
<T_0> strange <T_1> .
<T_0> had come to completely <T_1> this <T_2> blue dot <T_3> its reas@@ sur@@ ing <T_4> hal@@ o .
<T_2> can leave <T_1> aes@@ thetic ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments to <T_0> writers and the <T_3> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_0> when he was <T_3> . so <T_2> would be <T_1> this june .
<T_1> f@@ ed the s@@ la@@ ves <T_4> to the anti@@ ll@@ es , the <T_6> &quot; ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a <T_9> &quot; -- &quot; <T_3> rice s@@ alt fish are <T_8> &quot; -- <T_5> an em@@ ble@@ m of <T_7> importance <T_2> s@@ alt co@@ d from nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern <T_0> .
would it give <T_0> block of li@@ me@@ stone <T_1> proper@@ ties ?
<T_0> we &apos;re <T_1> there <T_2> .
so <T_3> don &apos;t i <T_5> them <T_4> helped them <T_2> , and <T_1> it on to <T_0> ?
<T_4> you give <T_3> this happy <T_2> , you give <T_1> the <T_5> to make <T_0> happ@@ ier .
<T_3> this <T_4> &apos;t finished at all , but it &apos;s <T_0> on@@ going <T_2> where people can <T_1> to collabor@@ ate .
so , <T_2> i <T_1> a der@@ mat@@ ologist , i started <T_5> general <T_0> , <T_4> most der@@ mat@@ ologists do <T_3> britain .
so <T_1> immediately decided , this is <T_0> to be the name <T_2> the game , or <T_3> new <T_4> .
she <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> about this . <T_3> was <T_2> .

<T_0> this happens to <T_2> of people <T_1> year .
there <T_0> what <T_1> tells us .
<T_1> finally , well , isn &apos;t <T_0> just <T_2> ?
it &apos;s just <T_0> two not@@ es <T_1> the <T_2> .
<T_0> is : <T_2> isn &apos;t <T_1> happening now ?
and he <T_3> about a lot of the <T_0> things <T_2> ki@@ p@@ p <T_4> doing to take inn@@ er-@@ city <T_1> and turn them in the <T_6> of <T_5> .

one day <T_9> nasa man@@ ager comes <T_6> my <T_8> , <T_5> down <T_3> says , &quot; can <T_0> please <T_4> us , <T_1> do we look for <T_7> outside <T_2> ? &quot;
this one <T_2> the wind <T_1> all around <T_0> united <T_3> .

<T_2> , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t <T_0> so well <T_1> either .
<T_1> with <T_6> support of a leader who <T_7> willing , at the <T_4> , to do the <T_3> , we put <T_2> a <T_9> reform <T_0> , <T_5> we developed <T_8> .

<T_1> doctors <T_3> the may@@ o <T_2> ur@@ ged me not to take this <T_4> out here <T_5> this -- <T_0> be here .
<T_0> the same <T_3> , <T_1> some cases , will <T_2> when <T_4> simply <T_6> another person being <T_5> .
pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment <T_1> exam@@ in@@ ations <T_0> seen as <T_2> .
and <T_1> did like , you know , <T_3> nar@@ r@@ ator , <T_2> i read <T_0> .
<T_4> . we &apos;ve <T_3> a <T_0> of people speak at <T_2> conference <T_6> the <T_1> of the <T_5> mind .
<T_1> there it <T_3> , <T_0> , as <T_4> &apos;s starting to get resol@@ ved <T_5> , and then <T_6> &apos;s <T_2> school .
<T_1> an <T_0> video .
you &apos;re not really given any <T_3> , <T_2> the <T_0> of the <T_1> itself keep <T_4> in <T_5> .
this <T_5> know <T_3> , because even <T_0> i <T_1> throughout the world to listen <T_6> these <T_2> and <T_4> them , i <T_7> .
currently , they &apos;re using a <T_1> of trial and <T_3> , <T_4> this <T_0> tell you <T_5> what disease <T_2> have .
the <T_5> on <T_1> is <T_7> gene@@ tically <T_8> chin@@ o@@ ok sal@@ mon , using <T_0> gene from these sal@@ mon <T_9> from one <T_3> fish <T_2> we eat , to make it grow <T_4> faster using a lot <T_6> feed .
<T_1> could <T_2> change things <T_0> significantly .
maybe <T_7> we <T_0> start doing <T_5> , we <T_6> make it <T_4> un@@ accep@@ table to say <T_2> to plastic in <T_3> che@@ ck@@ out <T_1> .
<T_1> students <T_0> i got very excited <T_3> this a <T_2> years ago .
and , of <T_1> , <T_0> faces .
so <T_2> decided -- <T_4> had <T_3> crazy <T_1> at two in the <T_0> .
<T_1> this is my <T_0> .
in <T_4> , <T_5> &apos;s as large as <T_1> , but it <T_0> has 300 miles <T_3> pa@@ ved roads <T_2>
in fact , <T_7> american <T_6> of my <T_8> , &quot; <T_5> elephant , the <T_4> and the <T_1> , &quot; ad@@ ded a <T_0> subti@@ tle saying , &quot; india <T_3> the next <T_9> power <T_2> &quot;
not a <T_0> .
<T_0> just doesn &apos;t drive <T_1> .
when <T_2> am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id sequence <T_0> pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced <T_3> atoms , these little <T_1> are sti@@ cky for each other .
so <T_0> &apos;re going to start <T_1> video .
a <T_0> like on this <T_1> here <T_2>
the women <T_1> very good <T_0> getting <T_2> now .
<T_1> i <T_4> , &quot; <T_3> ants , are they looking <T_0> the que@@ en <T_2> ?

<T_2> was <T_0> water i <T_1> up in .
<T_0> are powered by the sun . solar pan@@ els power them .
and <T_0> wanted to do it , because -- i believed -- <T_2> continue my <T_1> .
their <T_3> bl@@ ends into <T_0> sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alized dra@@ ma <T_1> prime time <T_2> .
<T_2> be a really big <T_1> to you . <T_3> # <T_5> : <T_4> that <T_0> wife ?
<T_2> world <T_0> an international <T_1> .
<T_4> went <T_1> one percent <T_3> 90 percent of the <T_0> of <T_2> .
now , below that board of <T_1> , you &apos;ve got essentially what are <T_3> v@@ ps -- people <T_2> control , say , the south side of chicago , <T_0> the west side of chicago .
<T_0> marriage for <T_1> .
<T_5> &apos;s been a <T_6> of ink given to <T_3> enormous <T_0> that <T_2> &apos;ve made in <T_1> treatment of <T_4> people .
<T_0> percent of our hou@@ se@@ holds <T_1> .
m <T_0> you <T_2> . <T_1> p@@ at .
<T_0> to me , <T_2> its <T_1> strange way , is <T_3> , very <T_4> .
<T_7> &apos;s a <T_4> at ober@@ lin <T_6> we <T_2> that <T_3> more energy than <T_0> needs to oper@@ ate and <T_1> its <T_5> water .
<T_4> are those <T_0> , <T_3> they &apos;re not <T_1> us , <T_2> against us .
<T_0> paint <T_1> well .
but <T_9> decided and i <T_3> to <T_7> this point to the thing i <T_1> wanted to do -- was to <T_4> as many <T_0> as <T_6> re@@ gain the <T_2> confidence they <T_5> along <T_8> way .
<T_3> raise your <T_1> -- <T_0> , that &apos;s a <T_2> .
<T_2> country <T_1> is possibly <T_0> . &quot;
it <T_7> you &apos;re <T_4> 10,000 feet <T_2> second faster <T_0> you <T_3> want to be <T_1> get back <T_6> your gas <T_5> .
it &apos;s something that a group <T_1> countries and <T_5> world blind union are adv@@ oc@@ ating , <T_7> cros@@ s-@@ bor@@ der <T_6> so that if books are available under <T_0> copy@@ right exception and the other country has a copy@@ right exception , we can transport those books <T_3> bor@@ ders <T_4> give life to people , particularly <T_8> developing countries , blind <T_9> who don &apos;t have the <T_2> to read .
they <T_0> to be precisely <T_1> .
it &apos;s <T_3> when you &apos;re <T_0> to <T_4> wife <T_2> you &apos;re mad at <T_1> else .
because that &apos;s really the <T_0> we <T_2> know what <T_1> &apos;re made of .
<T_2> we know <T_1> made of some <T_3> of <T_0> you see de@@ pic@@ ted <T_4> .
<T_0> will <T_2> be using grid <T_6> to do <T_4> much everything , <T_3> adjust the data <T_5> everything that goes <T_1> the data .
this <T_1> a <T_2> of the <T_0> .
so <T_1> is <T_0> form of synthetic <T_4> of the <T_5> of an extin@@ ct species with <T_2> genome of its <T_3> living <T_6> .
and <T_6> from <T_9> few <T_1> important <T_2> ends , which you &apos;ve heard about here -- <T_8> dark energy <T_5> dark <T_7> -- <T_4> equ@@ ation <T_0> , seems to describe everything about the <T_3> and what &apos;s in it .
<T_5> we wait <T_3> years , it is <T_1> percent <T_2> year -- <T_0> difficult and <T_6> , perhaps <T_4> .
&quot; i <T_0> to hold my <T_1> for <T_3> really long <T_4> . how <T_2> it be done ? &quot;
<T_1> other one <T_3> , but <T_0> too <T_2> patterns .
<T_1> with his <T_3> diplom@@ a , his <T_0> , he found <T_4> working at a dy@@ er <T_2> dr@@ y cle@@ an@@ er .
and you see <T_8> the <T_3> never <T_5> because <T_4> feet -- <T_0> must be nothing between <T_7> <T_2> and the earth <T_6> a <T_1> .
well how <T_0> you go about <T_1> ?
<T_1> we are . <T_4> , <T_3> can &apos;t show you a picture <T_2> this <T_0> object .
<T_1> &apos;s not really a <T_0> decision , &quot; i &apos;m going to do <T_2> next , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
and <T_1> only thing <T_6> had <T_3> on : well , if <T_4> could <T_7> them , i <T_0> clearly <T_8> able <T_2> tell them <T_5> .
<T_0> , i just <T_3> you <T_4> lot of <T_2> and a lot of <T_5> , and <T_1> is more of a visual <T_6> .
and <T_0> it is , <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> b@@ am@@ bi <T_1> .
<T_3> maybe me , i give out <T_2> better <T_0> i give <T_1> hope . &quot;
<T_2> big ? <T_4> , i <T_5> give you the numbers -- 14@@ 0,000 <T_3> -- but <T_6> <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> tell you very much .
<T_0> &apos;s like <T_1> rain@@ bo@@ w .
so you <T_0> it that <T_1> .
<T_2> fol@@ ds <T_1> thir@@ ds . it &apos;s <T_3> very <T_5> pattern -- <T_4> wouldn &apos;t <T_0> call that origami .
<T_1> all <T_0> help , <T_2> those of <T_3> who <T_4> very se@@ as@@ oned .
finally , after about <T_3> years of ali@@ en@@ ating <T_9> and <T_7> ali@@ ke , i <T_8> got it , a new personal truth all <T_5> own , that <T_2> i was going to <T_0> well with <T_6> people the ideas that i was <T_1> , i &apos;d better <T_4> a different way of going about it .
<T_1> memory we would be <T_0> .
there were so <T_2> times when i <T_0> i &apos;d hit that <T_7> , but <T_6> no choice <T_4> to just carry on <T_3> try and <T_8> out how <T_5> was going to get to the other <T_9> without <T_1> myself crazy .
<T_3> that doesn &apos;t mean my bias is <T_0> , and most <T_4> , all of <T_2> tested <T_1> .
<T_2> women <T_3> develop <T_4> die from it many years <T_1> , and <T_0> women , than@@ k@@ fully <T_5> survive .
<T_1> g@@ am@@ ley <T_4> up to give <T_2> the impossible <T_5> that <T_0> was never <T_3> to have .
and <T_1> &apos;re going to be wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly <T_2> again to your mobile <T_4> so you <T_0> go places <T_3> be monit@@ ored <T_5> .
don &apos;t try to be like those fol@@ ks <T_5> &quot; <T_7> &amp; <T_6> ; <T_4> &quot; <T_2> those other <T_0> shows <T_1> pu@@ m@@ mel their <T_3> into sub@@ mission .
<T_6> then wow , <T_7> a <T_9> idea , we -- except in the united states -- <T_8> be able <T_5> use this <T_4> technology to <T_0> interact with a <T_3> or a doctor on the <T_2> end <T_1> line .
<T_0> thing that helped <T_4> as <T_2> little kid is , boy , <T_5> the &apos; <T_3> , you were <T_1> man@@ ners .
now , at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning when you &apos;re all alone , haven &apos;t had much sleep , <T_6> was a very roman@@ tic idea , <T_8> it was that <T_4> -- the fact that you could in fact prove that <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> out there just using this same technology -- <T_5> appe@@ aled to me so much that 20 years later i took a job at the se@@ ti institute . now , i have to say that my <T_7> is <T_2> por@@ ous , and i &apos;ve often <T_0> whether there was any truth in this story , or i was just , you know , mis@@ remember@@ ing something , <T_9> i recently just ble@@ w up this old negative of mine , and sure enough , there you can see the sh@@ klo@@ v@@ sky and sa@@ gan book underneath that an@@ alog cal@@ cul@@ ating device .
&quot; <T_1> , <T_3> the <T_4> is <T_2> now , &quot; they <T_0> .
<T_1> of course there is <T_0> number <T_2> .
ter@@ ence <T_4> po@@ e@@ try , and the <T_1> po@@ et <T_0> ca@@ v@@ af@@ y is <T_2> of my favorite <T_3> .
this is an <T_2> that &apos;s <T_0> un@@ explor@@ ed <T_5> here &apos;s a little <T_1> of data <T_4> can <T_3> you .
and we <T_3> to think <T_0> more in <T_5> of narra@@ tives <T_2> whose narra@@ tive <T_1> going to <T_4> effective .
so , this is <T_0> view <T_2> what <T_1> are .
<T_1> decided <T_3> have children <T_2> i was working on <T_0> project .
<T_8> anywhere <T_9> a few <T_6> to a <T_1> weeks , fun@@ er@@ al cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies are a <T_2> aff@@ air , where com@@ memor@@ ating <T_0> who &apos;s died is <T_3> so <T_7> a private sa@@ dness but <T_5> of a publi@@ c@@ ly <T_4> transition .
and here is an example <T_7> one of <T_2> analy@@ ses : &quot; the move from a stru@@ c@@ tur@@ alist account in which capital is <T_1> to structure social relations in relatively hom@@ olog@@ ous ways <T_9> a view of he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y in which power relations are subject to repe@@ ti@@ tion , conver@@ gen@@ ce <T_5> re@@ artic@@ u@@ lation brought the question of tempor@@ ality into <T_3> thinking of <T_4> , and mar@@ ked a shift from the <T_8> of al@@ th@@ us@@ ser@@ ian theory that takes <T_6> tot@@ alities <T_0> theore@@ tical objects ... &quot;
now i <T_0> a beli@@ ever in democracy .
you &apos;re going to <T_3> , in <T_2> two <T_1> , the <T_0> wor@@ ms are <T_4> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_2> the water of <T_3> stream ; <T_1> never <T_0> still .
<T_1> &apos;s the short <T_0> . that &apos;s the fl@@ ame part .
if <T_1> want a more <T_2> model -- <T_3> is <T_0> g@@ m car .
four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders love <T_0> dinosau@@ rs , they <T_1> them .
<T_0> problem <T_2> shi@@ f@@ ting <T_4> can be@@ de@@ vil <T_1> attemp@@ ts to make <T_3> decisions .
<T_1> personally wrote <T_3> of code <T_2> write <T_0> co@@ ok@@ book .
are <T_2> in the middle of <T_0> unusual <T_1> in <T_3> op@@ ini@@ on ?
so we <T_1> run this through to <T_0> like pro@@ sthe@@ tics , <T_3> is highly speci@@ alized <T_4> an individual &apos;s <T_2> .
they &apos;re <T_1> made from local <T_0> .
we <T_1> the biggest <T_0> art <T_2> ever .
and <T_4> the <T_0> bre@@ e@@ ze isn &apos;t <T_7> , <T_5> kids de@@ plo@@ y <T_2> , <T_3> not the kind <T_1> bub@@ bles <T_6> know .
<T_4> images that <T_5> at one time , there <T_2> very <T_3> flo@@ wing water <T_0> the surface <T_1> mars .
and , <T_3> , i don &apos;t think <T_2> &apos;ll have <T_7> for you to <T_0> everybody i <T_5> , <T_6> -- i &apos;m <T_9> to <T_1> myself , it &apos;s my <T_4> time <T_8> .
<T_2> would <T_1> do to eat <T_3> baby or your <T_0> .
<T_3> don &apos;t want to create a perfect <T_1> like <T_0> perfect <T_2> .
<T_3> before <T_2> , <T_4> con@@ dom was <T_0> as the girl &apos;s <T_1> friend .
and <T_0> does that in <T_5> middle <T_1> having great fore@@ play <T_2> meeting their <T_3> . so it &apos;s not mu@@ tu@@ ally <T_4> .
<T_1> are living in <T_0> . <T_2> are living <T_3> their v@@ ill@@ as .
so to address <T_3> , <T_1> developed with <T_4> dr. <T_0> in stanford : virtual <T_2> .
you <T_7> , <T_2> at the beginning of <T_6> year , <T_9> the turn of the new <T_4> , <T_3> york <T_0> ma@@ yo@@ r michael <T_5> made a new year &apos;s resol@@ ution <T_8> he was going to learn to <T_1> in 2012 .
so i <T_7> up there , and i lived <T_5> these <T_3> out in their wh@@ aling camp here , and photographed the entire <T_6> , <T_0> with <T_8> tax@@ i ri@@ de to ne@@ war@@ k air@@ port in new <T_2> , and en@@ ding <T_4> the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ing of the second <T_9> , seven and a half days <T_1> .
so what do we <T_0> about complex <T_1> ?
now , <T_4> a politi@@ cian myself , standing in front of <T_0> , or indeed , meeting any stran@@ ger <T_3> in <T_7> world , when i <T_5> reve@@ al the <T_8> of my prof@@ ession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a sna@@ ke , a <T_9> and an <T_6> , <T_2> through all of this , <T_1> feel , stron@@ gly , that something is going wrong .
<T_0> happened <T_4> i began travel@@ ing <T_2> v-day , eight <T_1> ago . i got <T_3> .
<T_2> . <T_3> : you &apos;ve got <T_1> ... 14@@ -@@ foot <T_0> .
for three <T_0> , <T_1> were in hi@@ ding .
how do we <T_1> an airplane <T_0> mars ?
study <T_0> the ancient climate <T_1> very <T_2> .
in <T_1> part of <T_2> world , too many <T_0> live below the <T_3> .
another way of putting <T_8> is , is <T_7> some <T_1> problem <T_2> we cannot <T_4> get computers to solve , yet we can spli@@ t <T_5> tiny 10@@ -@@ second <T_6> such that <T_3> time somebody sol@@ ves <T_9> cap@@ tcha they <T_0> a little bit of this problem ?
<T_2> the bacteria are <T_0> on <T_1> sugar nutri@@ ents in <T_3> li@@ qu@@ id .
this <T_0> is also <T_1> .
les@@ lie or@@ gel is <T_4> a <T_3> , <T_2> guy , <T_1> or@@ gel &apos;s second <T_5> is <T_6> <T_0> is cle@@ ver@@ er than you are .
<T_7> &apos;re <T_3> ma@@ mm@@ als here , <T_6> all have a lot of neu@@ ral <T_5> hor@@ mon@@ al programm@@ ing that <T_4> us really <T_2> with others , care for <T_8> , feel <T_0> for others , especially <T_1> weak <T_9> vulnerable .
<T_4> stor@@ m sc@@ ours the <T_5> , was@@ hing out <T_6> , <T_2> , tra@@ ce chemicals , and de@@ pos@@ iting them on the snow p@@ ack <T_8> after year , <T_7> after <T_3> , <T_9> a <T_1> of peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table of elements <T_0> at this point is more than 1@@ 1,000 feet th@@ ick .
so <T_3> , <T_1> example , <T_2> hydro@@ gen@@ -@@ gener@@ ating <T_0> .
this <T_5> , <T_0> the ri@@ ght-@@ hand <T_7> , is what &apos;s called a -- <T_6> you look <T_3> the fine print <T_2> the <T_4> -- it &apos;s <T_1> hotel .
<T_1> what <T_0> ?
<T_6> we &apos;ve got <T_0> and things that get <T_1> , and <T_2> turns <T_7> the <T_4> that get <T_3> pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally <T_5> cold b@@ loo@@ ds .
in 2011 <T_2> young <T_9> swe@@ pt the top pri@@ zes of the <T_5> google science fair . lau@@ ren <T_1> , sh@@ re@@ e bo@@ se and <T_8> sha@@ h describe their <T_7> projects -- and <T_3> route <T_4> a <T_0> for <T_6> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , <T_6> &apos;s really the <T_1> of my <T_3> , is to a , communicate that <T_0> to you and b , have you <T_4> this s@@ ession a little <T_2> than when you <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;m <T_1> individual . i &apos;m one <T_0> .
<T_6> thing <T_0> was thinking of is something <T_5> most <T_2> us take for <T_3> today , but <T_4> his <T_1> it wasn &apos;t taken for <T_7> .
now , with all of my <T_4> , <T_6> i am an <T_7> , comes <T_0> healthy dose of <T_5> , or <T_8> , an <T_2> need to address some <T_3> , complex <T_1> .
<T_1> per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ates <T_0> spending .
<T_2> he <T_1> , he never <T_0> .
now you <T_0> ask <T_3> , how <T_1> he do <T_2> ?
and <T_0> was done <T_4> without <T_3> , <T_2> no one seem@@ ed to <T_1> .
are you guys ready to celebrate <T_0> ?
and the <T_1> said , &quot; if <T_2> &apos;ve finished <T_0> , <T_3> home .
yes .
<T_1> have to have those <T_0> . if <T_4> have -- <T_5> &apos;s <T_2> to get <T_3> interested in <T_6> .
<T_2> within a <T_4> years , that population of <T_0> had explo@@ ded <T_3> half a <T_1> .
but what <T_6> the <T_1> we face is not a <T_5> threat but <T_2> actually more like <T_8> , where there &apos;s just <T_7> much stuff coming <T_0> , <T_4> &apos;s just , &quot; start sho@@ ot@@ ing , come on , everybody , we &apos;ve got to just work <T_9> , just <T_3> sho@@ ot@@ ing . &quot;
and that &apos;s when <T_1> liber@@ i@@ ans <T_0> along .
<T_3> , <T_0> have <T_9> made an <T_5> discovery , a po@@ st-@@ do@@ c <T_2> the lab who is <T_6> physi@@ c@@ ist <T_4> me , what <T_8> the <T_7> do when <T_1> put them in ?
<T_1> was able to do <T_0> itself .
<T_2> , <T_0> super-@@ symmetri@@ c <T_4> are very strong <T_1> for the <T_3> matter .
<T_2> don &apos;t <T_3> of one in the world , and the <T_1> is <T_5> to <T_0> our <T_6> in our <T_4> .
here , used as a <T_0> , <T_1> .
they <T_0> lo@@ cked in .
<T_3> more optimi@@ stic <T_2> were , the <T_0> likely <T_5> region was <T_4> respond to unexpected <T_1> information .
for <T_0> , <T_1> is counter@@ intui@@ tive to have <T_6> il@@ liter@@ ate study particip@@ ant , <T_2> cel@@ ine , <T_3> a <T_8> con@@ sent form that <T_7> are un@@ able to <T_5> , let <T_4> understand .
<T_3> ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , you &apos;re not having a <T_0> of interaction with <T_1> who <T_2> unlike <T_4> .
i &apos;d want one to realize <T_1> defen@@ se <T_3> win@@ s cham@@ pi@@ on@@ shi@@ ps , <T_0> would work <T_4> on <T_2> .
it &apos;s <T_1> hal@@ f@@ way <T_0> the <T_2> .
i <T_2> , &quot; did <T_0> ever <T_1> you ? &quot;
now , let &apos;s take <T_0> little <T_2> around the <T_1> a little bit .
<T_2> &apos;s mostly un@@ explor@@ ed , <T_3> yet <T_6> are beautiful <T_7> like <T_5> that cap@@ tiv@@ ate <T_1> and make <T_4> become familiar with <T_0> .
<T_1> makes <T_0> great <T_2> in this context ?
and <T_3> waste@@ bas@@ k@@ et part , that &apos;s to <T_4> what <T_2> structure of spac@@ e-@@ time <T_1> is doing <T_0> this <T_5> .
mihal@@ y c@@ zi@@ ks@@ zent@@ mihal@@ y@@ i <T_5> , &quot; <T_1> makes a life <T_9> living ? &quot; not@@ ing <T_6> money cannot make <T_4> happy , he looks <T_7> those who find <T_2> and la@@ sting <T_0> in activi@@ ties that bring about a <T_3> of &quot; <T_8> . &quot;
these <T_1> &apos;t financial <T_0> ; this <T_2> culture .
i <T_0> coffee .
<T_1> : well , maybe it <T_2> , <T_0> it &apos;s really <T_3> else .
and the <T_4> is , <T_0> this we can <T_1> teach everything -- <T_2> , <T_3> that <T_6> be taught <T_5> this <T_7> of a fra@@ me@@ work .
one <T_3> is <T_0> this <T_2> , and his name <T_1> od@@ in .
no , <T_4> , no , <T_1> , <T_3> . <T_2> take <T_0> .
so <T_1> just swit@@ ched on <T_2> the train , <T_0> .
<T_3> : all <T_4> . now <T_2> week , when i <T_6> this , <T_5> had me measure <T_0> spo@@ t to the <T_1> .
they <T_1> only one-@@ sev@@ ent@@ h of <T_2> way up that <T_0> .
<T_3> : a <T_1> walked <T_0> the <T_4> , asking <T_2> we &apos;d been .
this <T_6> what <T_9> scientists call <T_7> de@@ liber@@ ation , and <T_1> happens when <T_8> are actually <T_2> out to <T_0> cri@@ tics <T_4> letting them engage with <T_3> other <T_5> .
<T_0> low <T_3> con@@ figuration is one in which there &apos;s only a <T_1> ar@@ r@@ ange@@ ments that <T_2> that way .
now you might <T_0> , <T_4> , <T_9> &apos;s <T_8> extremely <T_5> example , <T_7> i wouldn &apos;t want <T_2> be guil@@ ty of the <T_1> kind of cher@@ r@@ y-@@ pi@@ cking and sele@@ ctive <T_6> that i &apos;m ac@@ c@@ using <T_3> people of .
what <T_2> are , is <T_3> very simple <T_1> that goes back 50,000 <T_0> .
it &apos;s that there is <T_0> point and that <T_1> doesn &apos;t have to be a <T_2> .
they <T_4> go off in their <T_2> , off <T_6> their <T_1> , off in <T_5> pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , all the while <T_3> that <T_0> &apos;s somebody <T_7> they come back .
so what <T_2> &apos;re doing now <T_0> we &apos;re taking <T_1> of the words <T_5> the <T_3> cannot <T_6> and we &apos;re getting people <T_4> read them for us <T_8> they &apos;re typ@@ ing <T_9> cap@@ tcha on <T_7> internet .
the <T_6> wide <T_4> , <T_0> french are told , <T_7> to be refer@@ red to as &quot; <T_2> toi@@ le <T_5> &apos;@@ ar@@ a@@ ig@@ nee mon@@ di@@ ale &quot; -- <T_1> global <T_9> web -- <T_3> that the french ga@@ ily <T_8> .
<T_4> wonder <T_1> moon <T_5> the window seems to have dri@@ fted <T_2> of a love <T_3> that you <T_0> to know by <T_6> .
<T_3> can see <T_2> doesn &apos;t make <T_7> to make an <T_4> of <T_5> zero <T_0> and <T_1> very <T_6> impro@@ v@@ ement .
<T_2> one <T_1> land had any idea <T_3> anything had gone <T_0> .
<T_5> land where <T_0> field <T_2> a gra@@ ve , <T_6> millions of <T_4> have been de@@ por@@ ted or <T_1> in the 20th <T_3> .
<T_1> about <T_0> minute .
<T_1> big break came <T_0> 2004 .
now there <T_0> also another <T_1> important <T_2> , and this is <T_3> dynamic <T_4> analy@@ tics don &apos;t see .
<T_0> villa@@ gers <T_4> she <T_3> cur@@ sed ; <T_2> didn &apos;t know what to do with <T_1> .
mar@@ gar@@ et <T_1> was <T_0> mother .
the <T_0> reason is , <T_7> cannot keep doing animal <T_8> forever , <T_6> we <T_1> to em@@ body all our <T_5> and <T_4> our <T_2> into a <T_3> model .
and i was on <T_6> college cho@@ ir tour up <T_8> northern california , <T_0> we <T_7> stopped for <T_1> day after all day on <T_5> bus , and <T_9> were rel@@ ax@@ ing <T_4> to this beautiful <T_2> lake <T_3> the mountains .
that &apos;s not <T_0> i &apos;m <T_1> .
that was <T_0> my inten@@ tion . <T_3> was just making <T_2> requ@@ ests as part <T_4> research <T_5> my <T_1> book .
birds then <T_3> , bringing <T_4> seeds , <T_1> our <T_2> became an <T_0> of life .
this <T_3> the <T_0> of <T_1> , <T_2> last two months .
<T_0> &apos;s not <T_2> -- <T_1> doesn &apos;t work .
<T_3> doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste <T_2> , so i &apos;m <T_1> to need some <T_0> with that .
and , i get a lot of <T_1> for this <T_0> cambridge .
<T_1> there are <T_0> really <T_2> things about this .
<T_6> leads , in the <T_2> cases , <T_3> the <T_5> of a <T_0> like emi@@ l <T_4> , it leads to <T_1> rates of suici@@ de .
<T_1> in the long-term , <T_0> feeling <T_2> reality are <T_3> .
so <T_5> did just <T_0> ; <T_1> gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this <T_2> of evidence , and we just <T_4> them <T_3> make it go .
<T_4> one &apos;s a little bit more <T_2> , and <T_6> is from <T_9> study <T_5> we did <T_3> uganda <T_7> how <T_8> who are sharing <T_0> , use those <T_1> .
and <T_1> was the <T_4> of the <T_6> of <T_5> , <T_2> it was <T_3> the end of the exponenti@@ al <T_0> of computing .
maybe <T_1> even got published in <T_2> high-@@ profi@@ le <T_0> journ@@ al .
<T_1> remember <T_0> sitting <T_3> the <T_2> s@@ mil@@ ing .
and what we &apos;ve shown is <T_5> doing a <T_2> ir@@ radiation -- this <T_3> the th@@ ick <T_1> here -- <T_4> is sh@@ ining u@@ v on <T_7> arm so it war@@ ms up but <T_6> it <T_9> so the <T_8> don &apos;t hit <T_0> skin .
<T_4> when <T_0> was seven <T_3> old , <T_5> of a sudden , <T_1> search party arri@@ ved at <T_2> home .
next is an <T_1> artist , <T_3> jack@@ son , and <T_2> is <T_8> a <T_5> of her@@ s <T_7> &quot; <T_6> an art@@ work does <T_0> we &apos;re <T_4> watching . &quot;
i <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> it &apos;s war@@ ran@@ ted .
so <T_5> can <T_4> do to restore <T_0> micro@@ bi@@ al <T_2> when <T_3> have thousands and thousands <T_1> species on <T_6> ?
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> all the <T_2> come from .
five <T_2> later , those women lived twice <T_3> long , <T_6> you can see <T_5> the <T_8> -- <T_4> that was <T_0> only difference <T_7> the <T_1> .
<T_4> population , pc plac@@ ements , <T_6> archi@@ ve of all the <T_0> liter@@ ature , <T_8> &apos;s law , the <T_1> way of <T_5> , and <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> the new <T_7> .
<T_0> i go , &quot; <T_1> know , <T_6> don &apos;t we <T_5> on the <T_4> , and maybe we <T_2> see ... like <T_3> wikipedia . &quot;
<T_3> go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , <T_2> if you don &apos;t have st@@ able power <T_1> , <T_4> doesn &apos;t <T_5> , so kids <T_0> .
you <T_9> , when you <T_3> to forget , you <T_6> &apos;t want to see <T_4> , so <T_1> just want to go to <T_2> room , <T_7> lo@@ ck <T_8> inside and <T_5> , &quot; that &apos;s <T_0> . &quot;
and that <T_1> the fin@@ ishing <T_0> right there .
<T_1> the dri@@ vers <T_0> becoming members . <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> .
so <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> way in <T_5> something that <T_2> quite <T_1> can have <T_6> na@@ sty <T_0> .
<T_3> demo@@ graphi@@ c <T_0> is incredible , <T_5> parado@@ x@@ ically , there &apos;s <T_1> the mi@@ rage of <T_4> labor <T_2> .
<T_1> what was left <T_2> the city <T_0> followed .
<T_2> why do <T_0> call david an <T_1> ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_5> very appropri@@ ate to do it now . <T_6> people tell <T_3> to do <T_1> ; <T_4> think , well , <T_7> &apos;s <T_0> really pro@@ per , you know , these days .
this <T_4> , they are <T_1> producing eight <T_3> nets a <T_7> , and they emplo@@ y 5,000 <T_5> , <T_6> percent <T_0> wh@@ om are <T_8> , <T_2> uns@@ killed .
<T_4> one <T_6> in particular <T_3> on <T_0> me these pretty <T_1> messa@@ ges , and <T_5> was dres@@ sed as <T_2> .
now , <T_4> the <T_7> had stopped with that <T_3> great <T_1> , <T_0> we <T_6> &apos;t be the <T_5> of so <T_2> wonderful designs today .
go <T_2> and <T_1> that <T_0> sound ic@@ on .
but one , <T_5> me , that &apos;s most <T_6> is the <T_0> sensi@@ tivity <T_1> small <T_2> that can <T_4> large <T_8> in <T_3> development -- <T_7> output .
a human being , <T_0> child , can just watch <T_4> par@@ ent kill <T_5> pol@@ ar bear , and skin it <T_9> put the skin on its <T_7> , <T_3> on the <T_2> , and learn it in one <T_1> . what the pol@@ ar bear took 100,000 years to learn , <T_6> can learn in five <T_8> , maybe 10 minutes .
over <T_2> last <T_3> years , i &apos;ve had <T_5> privilege to travel to over <T_7> countries , many of <T_0> in the emerging markets , <T_6> latin america , <T_9> , <T_1> my own <T_8> of <T_4> .
a third <T_2> we are looking <T_0> and very interested in <T_1> simulation .
my parents <T_3> this whole <T_0> story <T_2> sant@@ a cl@@ aus : <T_7> they had talked to sant@@ a cl@@ aus himself and agreed <T_1> instead of sant@@ a <T_5> our pres@@ ents over the night of christmas e@@ ve , like <T_9> did <T_4> every other <T_6> who got to open their <T_8> first thing christmas morning , our family would give sant@@ a more time .
now , <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> those <T_2> ag@@ it@@ ated with <T_0> actions around <T_4> .
<T_1> have <T_2> on <T_0> wing .
<T_5> four years ago <T_2> took a team <T_6> students down <T_0> ha@@ iti , <T_1> we <T_4> with <T_7> cor@@ ps <T_3> there .
<T_3> was <T_2> christmas time . <T_0> was a <T_1> tree .
<T_1> there &apos;s an <T_2> military <T_0> .
i <T_0> half a do@@ zen <T_1> .
there <T_0> no <T_2> you can know what <T_1> want .
<T_2> study <T_1> different <T_0> .
now , what i &apos;m going <T_5> do <T_2> , <T_6> &apos;m going to see <T_4> -- i <T_3> &apos;t <T_1> out of these , <T_0> .
<T_1> what <T_0> computer inter@@ face used to look <T_3> , dos <T_2>
this <T_3> the dist@@ in@@ ction <T_2> time <T_1> space , <T_0> means <T_5> laws of evolution can <T_4> deter@@ mine the <T_6> state .
now , <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> oral re@@ hydra@@ tion therapy .
<T_2> you . <T_3> &apos;m so <T_0> to <T_1> here .
<T_0> built <T_2> units to do that <T_4> a monit@@ or@@ ing test <T_1> the dur@@ ability and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure and <T_5> , so <T_3> .
<T_3> st@@ um@@ bled <T_2> your <T_0> on deci@@ mals and <T_1> got through .
and <T_4> remembered a <T_0> from the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata , the <T_2> indian <T_8> : &quot; <T_1> is the <T_5> won@@ dr@@ ous <T_3> in <T_6> world , <T_7> ? &quot;
<T_8> have so often tried <T_0> dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate <T_5> ideas <T_1> choice , <T_6> that they <T_7> be , or ought to be , wel@@ com@@ ed <T_3> open <T_4> and <T_2> .
<T_1> said , &quot; <T_3> , <T_0> can &apos;t <T_2> my <T_4> . &quot;
<T_2> is <T_5> wor@@ d@@ scape <T_0> the word water , and you <T_3> see <T_1> of the action is <T_4> the <T_6> .
<T_1> is a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical <T_0> .
<T_2> demand <T_0> explanation from <T_1> .
<T_4> we make <T_1> smaller <T_3> less expensive , the <T_0> have less distance to <T_2> .
<T_2> i &apos;m starting <T_8> like <T_6> , i <T_5> do a whole <T_4> about <T_3> because a lot of <T_7> out there <T_1> &apos;t know what <T_0> is .
<T_0> is <T_1> specific .
<T_6> then <T_4> i have that <T_9> shape that we call the <T_5> , you <T_2> make the <T_3> nar@@ ro@@ wer , <T_7> can <T_0> them , you can turn it <T_1> the <T_8> shape .

but we <T_1> that <T_3> had a very <T_0> metho@@ d@@ ology <T_2> might <T_4> ...
and then as the <T_2> grow , they &apos;re all <T_1> that molecule <T_0> the <T_5> , <T_6> there &apos;s <T_4> of <T_3> there .

<T_1> it was earlier <T_3> year , when one of <T_2> original members <T_0> us to <T_4> focus in <T_5> organization .
so , how could <T_0> happen ?
<T_1> i &apos;ve covered in coffee , <T_3> i <T_2> the <T_4> to plu@@ g in <T_7> us@@ b <T_6> and print <T_0> a new <T_5> .

they were <T_2> turning pollu@@ tion <T_1> ab@@ undance for <T_0> desert people .

does he <T_6> look content , <T_2> to go , <T_8> he could <T_0> anything ? and then , if you look at <T_3> kid in <T_7> , it <T_5> like he &apos;s <T_4> cho@@ king <T_1> the <T_9> even happens .
<T_9> &apos;s about three miles out of nai@@ ro@@ bi , and it &apos;s a <T_0> long <T_1> about two-@@ ten@@ ths of a mile <T_3> , where over <T_7> a million people live cra@@ mm@@ ed in <T_2> little tin sha@@ cks , generation after <T_4> , <T_8> them , <T_6> eight or 10 <T_5> to a room .
<T_3> &apos;ve brought with me , from <T_0> california , <T_1> f@@ m <T_2> .
and these are <T_1> to make <T_0> world <T_2> them <T_3> better <T_4> .
but of <T_0> none of that <T_1> .
and <T_0> &apos;ve put <T_1> formul@@ a <T_2> there .
ice in <T_1> ice ch@@ est mel@@ ted <T_2> hours , <T_3> it <T_4> pretty <T_0> .
you just <T_2> teams <T_0> hundreds <T_1> people .
<T_6> is <T_3> little bit of a <T_0> , <T_1> we <T_7> need some <T_5> of idea of quality control , <T_4> this <T_2> really where the idea of re@@ view and pe@@ er re@@ view comes <T_8> .
<T_6> if <T_1> sat down and asked <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> are you <T_5> , and <T_2> do <T_4> do ? &quot;
right ?
<T_1> to a <T_6> -- <T_5> were all <T_0> -- to <T_3> man , every single one <T_4> them said , &quot; my <T_2> . &quot;
now this <T_0> has dou@@ bled the <T_7> of <T_5> original figure , <T_9> therefore we have <T_3> learned that <T_1> area of the tri@@ angle <T_4> the <T_8> of this re@@ ct@@ angle <T_6> by <T_2> .

<T_5> la@@ id down the <T_4> founda@@ tions <T_2> computer science , and <T_6> , &quot; <T_3> doesn &apos;t matter <T_0> you make <T_1> computer . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;m <T_2> very <T_1> &quot; possi@@ bili@@ st . &quot;
and <T_2> was <T_8> more <T_5> to me , and what i really got <T_7> up on , was <T_1> the world <T_3> screen seem@@ ed <T_4> have no physical reality <T_6> its <T_0> .
<T_0> issue isn &apos;t just <T_1> .
<T_0> didn &apos;t say <T_2> didn &apos;t even have a <T_1> . he <T_5> , <T_3> don &apos;t even know how to begin to think <T_4> it -- <T_6> don &apos;t <T_7> have a <T_8> .
so if <T_2> need is <T_6> place to start , <T_5> prototyp@@ ing , a vehicle for <T_4> , then <T_3> are also <T_1> questions to ask about <T_0> dest@@ ination .
<T_2> were <T_4> . especially in <T_1> , fra@@ gi@@ le <T_0> , you couldn &apos;t <T_3> it .
of course <T_1> , <T_0> can be <T_3> . <T_2> &apos;s expected .
<T_5> the <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> survival depen@@ ds on it <T_9> to raise <T_8> from its own <T_4> , such a government <T_6> dri@@ ven <T_7> self-@@ interest to <T_2> in a more en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ed <T_1> .

then <T_4> two fel@@ lo@@ ws came <T_3> , and they were flying kit@@ es <T_6> develop <T_2> control systems <T_5> would ultimately enable <T_0> human <T_1> .
<T_3> also use <T_0> as a tool for visu@@ ali@@ zing <T_2> tracking <T_1> .
these are some of the <T_7> : <T_6> , <T_0> , veget@@ ables , trees , fru@@ its , and <T_2> is very <T_9> -- nike <T_8> and <T_3> bis@@ cu@@ its ; <T_5> is <T_4> village <T_1> by nike .
<T_0> also have a lot of <T_4> in those <T_1> , and they don &apos;t always do <T_5> la@@ undry <T_2> much as <T_3> should .

this <T_2> another <T_0> from the <T_3> of visual <T_1> .
and generally , the <T_0> would say , oh , well <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> news .
and <T_5> hope <T_6> &apos;ve convin@@ ced you <T_3> that , which <T_1> that <T_9> real <T_0> is go out and say to <T_4> local leaders , <T_2> your national leaders , &quot; why <T_7> &apos;t you sol@@ ved <T_8> problems ?
here &apos;s a little <T_0> of <T_4> years of <T_5> , and it &apos;s been <T_6> domin@@ ant <T_3> of our energy system <T_1> most of those <T_2> years .
because <T_2> you sit a <T_6> time <T_0> summer <T_1> shor@@ ts , <T_4> will walk away with <T_3> br@@ and@@ ing of the story el@@ ement <T_5> your <T_7> .
<T_5> of the reasons that i took my <T_3> off <T_4> to spend <T_2> time <T_6> my family , and <T_8> really <T_1> thing happened where <T_7> si@@ ster@@ -@@ in-@@ law , her inte@@ st@@ ine suddenly stran@@ gl@@ ed one day , and we <T_0> her to the emer@@ gen@@ cy room , and <T_9> was , she was in really bad shape .
if <T_0> take the <T_3> above , you start <T_2> about these <T_1> again .
you go up in the <T_0> term , and then you go up <T_2> more in the long <T_1> .
<T_6> , we put <T_5> hand <T_3> my <T_0> and <T_4> , &quot; guys , <T_2> &apos;s just <T_1> stuff .
so <T_2> have <T_0> dat@@ ab@@ ase of <T_1> .
<T_5> by 2010 , we <T_1> actually 80 <T_6> of <T_2> who live <T_3> countries with about <T_0> children <T_4> woman .
<T_8> &apos;re still <T_5> us@@ able . they <T_2> be &quot; re-@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed , &quot; but the way they <T_9> things , which <T_1> very <T_4> , <T_7> think we <T_6> about <T_3> third of <T_0> nuclear wea@@ po@@ ns we had before .
<T_9> what big <T_2> can do <T_7> show us the nature of <T_1> comple@@ xity <T_5> fra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty <T_4> the danger@@ s that face <T_3> , but <T_0> can also <T_6> us our <T_8> with collective learning .
<T_2> is <T_1> care@@ taking <T_0> desire .
i only <T_3> data on <T_0> women who were going <T_5> be attra@@ cted to <T_2> type of <T_1> that <T_6> really , really wanted to <T_4> .
<T_4> don &apos;t need <T_3> data -- <T_2> need <T_1> good <T_0> about it .
when i got to the <T_0> for <T_5> next <T_2> , <T_3> years , <T_4> was held in <T_6> different children &apos;s <T_1> .
let me show you <T_0> it <T_1> like .
<T_3> notice that <T_2> the <T_1> gro@@ ws , <T_0> con@@ qu@@ ers terri@@ tory <T_5> then it <T_4> the net .
now the <T_2> material of it , of course , is just <T_1> music <T_0> everyday <T_3> .
took <T_5> fast , didn &apos;t get <T_4> . <T_0> fi@@ red , &apos; <T_1> ! &apos; <T_6> fell between <T_2> par@@ ked <T_3> .
<T_1> the <T_4> is <T_0> for ri@@ ley &apos;s <T_2> teachers , <T_5> ones she has <T_3> to meet .
the threat <T_1> worry <T_0> isn &apos;t <T_2> .
so our <T_1> is <T_6> bring <T_0> together , so they &apos;ll have a <T_7> service experience as well as a cros@@ s-@@ cultural experience , as <T_3> teach <T_9> in these <T_2> and help <T_4> build <T_5> communication <T_8> .
this <T_0> a guy called <T_1> .
<T_1> even <T_0> a child , <T_4> could feel the hea@@ vin@@ ess <T_2> their <T_3> .
and in <T_9> , we &apos;ve actually used pol@@ ari@@ zers <T_1> all the lights -- just like <T_7> sun@@ glas@@ ses can block <T_2> gl@@ are off of <T_3> road , pol@@ ari@@ zers can block <T_8> shine off of <T_5> skin , so <T_4> don &apos;t get all those spe@@ cul@@ ar <T_0> to take <T_6> map .
thank you .
it &apos;s in fact , <T_3> you should <T_4> thinking about <T_6> product <T_1> buy for yourself <T_0> try giving some <T_5> it to other <T_2> instead .
<T_1> &apos;s not <T_0> easy !
<T_4> dance of our <T_1> , <T_2> , ab@@ di@@ cation , <T_3> , <T_0> per@@ fu@@ me of our <T_5> .
and <T_4> is the model , <T_2> it &apos;s going to <T_5> . so , it &apos;s the same <T_6> ; the vehicle <T_1> different . and <T_0> &apos;s the <T_3> .
and so <T_3> every <T_5> hab@@ it@@ at <T_1> the <T_4> , like <T_0> amazon rain@@ forest you &apos;re hearing behind <T_2> .
<T_0> last but not <T_2> , it is <T_1> ob@@ s@@ ession .
&quot; we &apos;re going to give you <T_0> bucks -- four <T_2> for your <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> wait , the good news <T_0> it &apos;s at least better than <T_1> labs and gon@@ or@@ rhe@@ a .
<T_1> are all totally <T_0> .
and <T_0> said , &quot; <T_3> &apos;d <T_2> get that <T_1> ? &quot;

ultimately , especially <T_5> in this world , where we live in a context of <T_0> and on@@ er@@ ous im@@ migra@@ tion <T_2> , in reality tv that th@@ ri@@ ves on <T_9> , and in a context of analysis , where <T_6> thing we hear <T_3> repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , day-@@ in , day-@@ out <T_4> the united states , in <T_1> train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , please report any su@@ spi@@ cious behavior or su@@ spi@@ cious individuals to the auth@@ orities near@@ est you , &quot; when all of these ways we are encoura@@ ged to <T_7> our fellow human being with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty and fear and con@@ temp@@ t and <T_8> .
it &apos;s in <T_2> between <T_0> and <T_1> .
and <T_2> would <T_4> kind of throw <T_8> bu@@ ckets down <T_0> and hope <T_1> it would <T_6> go away , and of <T_7> it <T_5> really would go <T_3> .
and that <T_3> , there <T_0> an <T_2> gene , <T_4> mu@@ tation in the <T_1> that <T_5> this ab@@ normal cross wir@@ ing .
<T_3> said , &quot; <T_0> you qu@@ it <T_2> were you <T_1> ? &quot;

and if they try to fight us <T_0> the <T_1> , stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t-@@ up man@@ ner we &apos;re going to <T_3> their ass , which is <T_4> people don &apos;t try to do <T_2> any <T_5> .

<T_5> tells <T_4> that <T_1> in@@ signific@@ ance <T_0> that we <T_2> got to learn from the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can <T_3> , it &apos;s all <T_6> .

<T_3> surprise <T_1> bil@@ ba@@ o was in its <T_2> to <T_0> city .
so here <T_2> is <T_0> charac@@ teri@@ stic leng@@ th <T_1> the robot .
<T_0> was <T_1> mantra .
now a <T_6> of things <T_5> i <T_2> in my <T_1> about <T_8> project <T_3> , wouldn &apos;t it be interesting <T_4> thousands of <T_7> were doing <T_0> ?
and <T_1> neuro@@ science , we have <T_3> deal with many <T_2> questions about <T_0> brain .
so , i went <T_0> , i <T_6> , <T_9> ski@@ pped <T_7> few of the talks , and <T_5> went over <T_8> the national acade@@ my of <T_3> building , <T_4> they <T_2> to@@ ys , <T_1> microbes .
thank you very much .
in <T_3> , <T_4> a piece by <T_2> , and so <T_1> was <T_0> func@@ tioning as a com@@ pos@@ er .
<T_3> it &apos;s actually <T_4> , you <T_6> , <T_2> reason <T_7> &apos;m talking to <T_5> right now <T_0> because i was born <T_1> brazi@@ l .
<T_4> as i <T_2> , in sort of <T_3> 10 <T_1> we should start <T_0> see ...
and <T_0> have different <T_1> on this .
<T_6> &apos;s a <T_7> class of <T_3> like this , <T_5> with <T_2> adver@@ s@@ ari@@ es . they <T_4> if ever present with <T_8> repe@@ at@@ able <T_0> that &apos;s <T_1> to computers .
<T_1> it , i &apos;m <T_0> it .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_3> lot of <T_0> things , and i &apos;m <T_2> tell you <T_1> bit about them .
<T_1> then the second time i <T_2> it , <T_6> coun@@ sel@@ or came up to <T_0> with a <T_4> expression on her <T_8> and she repe@@ ated the point <T_9> camp spirit <T_5> said <T_3> should all work very hard to be <T_7> .
and <T_4> are just as <T_5> in telling <T_1> to <T_2> these little things around the ed@@ ges <T_6> missing the <T_0> in the living <T_3> .
maybe , to really be <T_1> , we <T_4> to stay <T_3> immer@@ sed <T_0> focused on our experience in <T_2> moment .
it &apos;s <T_6> beautiful idea . the <T_0> is <T_8> you really believe in a <T_2> where those who mer@@ it to <T_4> to the top , get <T_9> the top , you &apos;ll also , by imp@@ lication , and <T_3> a far more na@@ sty way , believe in a society where those who des@@ erve to get <T_5> the bottom also get to <T_7> bottom <T_1> stay there .
<T_5> , because <T_1> eli@@ te <T_4> its <T_0> have been making millions of <T_2> for <T_3> years .
it <T_2> me 2@@ 50,000 <T_0> to <T_1> this .
<T_2> if <T_5> mother had <T_3> us that <T_4> &apos;s family was <T_0> and <T_1> ?
now <T_6> &apos;s a <T_4> bit of a surprise <T_3> to <T_5> an answer <T_0> that <T_1> , in the <T_2> .
but <T_1> single <T_2> that <T_6> us , <T_4> atom in <T_5> , has already created a <T_8> of different things <T_7> will go <T_0> to create a <T_3> of <T_9> things .
now , by corruption <T_0> don &apos;t mean <T_1> paper ba@@ g cas@@ h secre@@ ted <T_2> members of con@@ gress .
<T_5> &apos;re in the process of trans@@ forming <T_2> this , to what i <T_0> call a <T_1> society , one <T_6> we <T_3> to nur@@ ture <T_4> .
i &apos;m just going back <T_1> forth ; i &apos;m <T_0> getting anywhere .
and <T_1> only accep@@ table <T_2> is -- -- <T_0> .
so that &apos;s my <T_2> , <T_3> you can have a <T_1> effect on these <T_0> .
which , even <T_2> yale , <T_1> extra@@ ordin@@ arily <T_0> .
<T_1> the <T_0> got it ?
<T_2> &apos;re going <T_1> tell me it &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> size of <T_0> .
<T_3> : <T_1> , what &apos;s your <T_4> on <T_0> people story ? are you <T_2> ?
<T_4> if a <T_1> of <T_3> could be inside <T_2> a lat@@ ti@@ ce of <T_5> and <T_0> with their material .
and <T_4> &apos;s time <T_8> our mathematics cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um to change <T_1> an@@ alog <T_5> digital , from <T_7> more classi@@ cal , continu@@ ous mathematics , to <T_6> more modern , dis@@ crete mathematics -- the <T_0> of un@@ certain@@ ty , of rand@@ om@@ ness , of data -- <T_9> being <T_3> and <T_2> .
<T_6> have to change <T_4> minds of the <T_2> people . because <T_0> the politi@@ cians do <T_1> have permission to do <T_3> needs to <T_5> done .
<T_3> takes <T_1> hour to make a <T_2> and <T_4> hours to make <T_0> ax@@ e .
so what <T_5> see <T_3> -- i <T_0> it <T_4> funny , <T_2> that &apos;s the way <T_1> works .
you <T_1> of course watch <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s worse <T_0> not having him <T_2> at all . &quot;
so , they &apos;re all <T_4> around <T_1> solution , and <T_3> look at them , you have to get <T_2> on <T_0> surface where they <T_5> .
<T_5> sa@@ d thing <T_4> , when <T_2> comes to diet , <T_8> that <T_3> when well-@@ inten@@ tioned <T_0> try to do <T_7> by <T_6> , they <T_1> .

so adoles@@ cence <T_1> defined as the period of life that starts with <T_2> biological , <T_9> , <T_8> changes of pu@@ ber@@ ty <T_5> ends at <T_6> age <T_4> which an individual at@@ tains a <T_7> , <T_0> role in <T_3> .
<T_3> know <T_0> these <T_1> des@@ erve on <T_2> healthcare side .
<T_0> would <T_2> use <T_1> example of <T_3> examples ? &quot;
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> to <T_7> that <T_4> you look up <T_5> &apos;s <T_2> , you &apos;re unlikely to see <T_6> res@@ em@@ bl@@ ing <T_0> .

now the video <T_3> industry is <T_0> and away the <T_2> growing <T_1> all modern <T_4> .

the <T_1> is <T_0> dinner table conversation in the least .

<T_0> &apos;s actually surpris@@ ingly <T_1> .

and it &apos;s <T_4> x-ray <T_1> , so <T_3> &apos;s an <T_0> model of <T_2> .

<T_0> get inti@@ macy <T_1> fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face <T_2> .
<T_6> in order to hear <T_2> and <T_0> what i &apos;m saying , you need <T_3> process <T_1> 60 <T_5> per <T_4> .
thank you .
now <T_0> form do they <T_1> ?
the <T_2> of those <T_4> , as opposed to <T_3> images <T_5> , <T_1> a government to change <T_0> policies .
and <T_0> we made the <T_5> , <T_4> it <T_3> since evolved <T_2> a four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot <T_1> structure .
<T_4> i think <T_9> glam@@ our <T_6> has a <T_0> bro@@ ader <T_7> -- one that <T_5> true for <T_3> movie stars and the fic@@ tional <T_1> , <T_8> also comes in <T_2> forms .
<T_0> shu@@ t down . <T_1> turn off .
<T_1> : are you <T_0> ?
so <T_0> these fac@@ tors , <T_7> many more <T_6> , we <T_4> &apos;t even <T_3> understand some of them yet , these came <T_2> to de@@ fe@@ at a <T_9> as big <T_5> bin la@@ den@@ ism , <T_8> global j@@ i@@ had , you needed <T_1> group effort .
so in some <T_2> , the foot <T_1> are a lot like <T_3> people who <T_4> your order at <T_0> &apos;s .
<T_0> scene of <T_3> , the <T_1> of <T_4> , <T_2> ali@@ bi location .
<T_3> actually , <T_2> believe there are <T_0> two <T_1> .
and <T_5> count the number <T_4> times until <T_1> pattern head@@ -@@ tail@@ -@@ head appears <T_0> you <T_3> them . <T_2> ?
and <T_3> said , &quot; well , you know , that <T_1> be a bit <T_2> for our <T_0> . &quot;
<T_3> last few <T_0> were of ray <T_2> , who <T_1> passed away last <T_4> .
<T_2> in doing so , they &apos;ll save a million <T_1> -- at least <T_0> million lives a <T_4> . a <T_3> lives .
<T_4> something to <T_2> about ton@@ ight <T_1> you &apos;ve <T_3> a <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_0> true .
<T_3> stuff -- it &apos;s <T_2> all been turned <T_1> its <T_0> .
and <T_0> made me <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_3> fact , you <T_5> cycle <T_0> weight up <T_1> down simply by <T_4> angiogen@@ esis .
that <T_5> fall of &apos; <T_2> . but then , by the <T_0> that winter was <T_3> around , he <T_7> , &quot; <T_6> know , <T_1> &apos;re good <T_4> .
it <T_1> &apos;t be that <T_0> .
and you &apos;ve <T_1> to get better , and <T_0> , and <T_3> , and <T_2> .
the <T_1> picture <T_3> the <T_0> of the real <T_2> for change .
<T_4> you <T_3> actually per@@ ver@@ sely tell people to come , <T_2> them <T_1> they <T_0> to come .
and of <T_6> we need <T_4> worry about the <T_1> , <T_3> the <T_0> that <T_8> that <T_7> &apos;ve been left out <T_2> one way or <T_5> .
<T_1> , <T_0> &apos;s a <T_2> to it .
my <T_2> , compar@@ ing <T_6> of chemical <T_0> in different <T_3> stars , <T_5> discovered alien <T_1> in our <T_4> .
<T_2> you can <T_1> this <T_5> p@@ sor@@ i@@ as@@ is break@@ through <T_6> by <T_0> re@@ verse <T_4> of &#91; un@@ clear &#93; by doing things <T_3> .
i mean , <T_1> are sort of the <T_2> examples , and <T_4> &apos;re <T_3> and good <T_0> lau@@ gh at .
<T_0> we need is <T_1> .
and it <T_1> ar@@ ou@@ sed huge <T_4> and <T_2> among <T_3> young <T_0> .
but <T_1> does <T_0> mean ?
two <T_3> after <T_2> spe@@ ech , in <T_0> , hundreds of <T_1> were made .
finan@@ cially , seen over the <T_0> term , it <T_2> actually <T_1> .
they <T_0> it would <T_2> their <T_1> values .
and i <T_1> that &apos;s some of the fear that <T_0> see about jobs disappe@@ aring <T_2> artificial <T_3> and <T_4> .
<T_1> really is <T_0> voice of our <T_2> .
but <T_0> it <T_2> sat <T_1> .
<T_3> says that <T_4> , <T_1> is a measure of the <T_0> of a <T_5> , will always <T_2> .
we do like to <T_0> , but <T_8> time <T_4> of these <T_1> tools came <T_2> , it <T_6> out <T_7> also <T_3> to produce and <T_5> like to share .
chip <T_3> : <T_0> is no lau@@ gh@@ ing matter . ok <T_1> it is <T_2>
<T_4> , it &apos;s <T_0> we have . i believe <T_1> are <T_2> human <T_3> .
<T_8> bring <T_1> civil society , we bring in n@@ gos , <T_2> bring in researchers and scientists <T_7> have an in@@ formed discussion -- <T_4> a battle roy@@ ale -- to figure out what are the <T_3> im@@ pac@@ ts of these products , what is a global <T_6> , <T_9> &apos;s an <T_0> impact , and design standards <T_5> that .
but it &apos;s <T_3> just <T_0> that has <T_1> health than <T_2> .
<T_2> has no <T_0> but <T_1> be@@ have .
<T_0> years later , i <T_1> this <T_3> -- we &apos;ll <T_2> her &quot; <T_4> fle@@ t@@ cher &quot; -- -- went travel@@ ing through <T_6> south of <T_5> together .
<T_4> &apos;ll be showing the <T_3> at the <T_5> , <T_1> before we do , i want to talk <T_0> little bit <T_2> what it is that they <T_6> .
<T_3> wife wouldn &apos;t <T_1> me for the <T_0> two <T_2> .
we also need to mo@@ bili@@ ze <T_0> in the <T_1> , not <T_2> to go into <T_4> traditional <T_8> , <T_5> to go <T_3> agriculture <T_6> also to <T_7> change from <T_9> .
so , i <T_4> , <T_9> it <T_2> that in <T_5> future , the hig@@ gs field <T_7> under@@ go a <T_1> transition and , <T_3> quantum tun@@ n@@ eling , will be trans@@ formed <T_6> this <T_0> , ultra@@ -@@ den@@ se <T_8> ?

<T_2> : so <T_1> don &apos;t happen <T_0> massa@@ ch@@ usetts .
most <T_7> non-@@ violent and they fall into <T_0> bro@@ ad <T_5> : active <T_1> with <T_6> ri@@ val@@ ries <T_4> religi@@ ous belie@@ fs and <T_8> , transpar@@ ent <T_2> development and <T_3> of <T_9> .
<T_3> stati@@ stic , perhaps <T_1> favorite , <T_2> to look <T_0> childhood deaths .
and <T_0> those are the <T_1> that are happening <T_3> the <T_2> projects .
when <T_2> began recor@@ ding in <T_5> late &apos; 60s , the <T_7> metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding were limited to <T_4> frag@@ mented <T_8> of individual species like birds <T_1> , in the <T_6> , <T_9> later <T_0> like ma@@ mm@@ als and <T_3> .
<T_4> a nuclear power plant , you <T_1> a <T_6> po@@ t of water that &apos;s under <T_0> pressure , and you have some fuel ro@@ ds , and these fuel ro@@ ds are <T_5> in zir@@ con@@ ium , and they &apos;re little p@@ el@@ lets <T_3> ur@@ ani@@ um di@@ oxide fuel , and <T_7> fis@@ sion reaction is controll@@ ed and main@@ ta@@ ined at a pro@@ per level , and that reaction <T_2> up water , the water turns <T_9> ste@@ am , ste@@ am turns the tur@@ b@@ ine , and you produce <T_8> from it .
when <T_4> run it <T_1> my <T_3> , <T_2> he@@ at@@ -@@ mapping shows <T_0> is intelli@@ gi@@ ble .

<T_0> a kid , <T_2> was fascin@@ ated <T_4> all <T_3> air and <T_1> .
so this <T_3> one particular <T_0> they <T_4> about , <T_1> it <T_5> be used <T_2> .
and that &apos;s how my <T_1> with <T_0> really began .
<T_2> &apos;ll look <T_1> sea level <T_0> .
now <T_7> were <T_1> those <T_2> when they weren <T_6> , when there was maybe <T_5> -- one <T_4> , maybe one <T_3> two <T_0> .

we &apos;re having a debate .
and <T_6> marine ma@@ mm@@ als have <T_8> over the last <T_5> of millions <T_9> years <T_0> ways to dep@@ end on <T_3> to <T_1> expl@@ ore their world <T_2> also <T_7> stay <T_4> touch with one another .
<T_1> was separ@@ ated , lar@@ gely , <T_2> my <T_0> , including <T_3> mother <T_4> father .

<T_1> &apos;re <T_0> hi@@ v-@@ positive .
and <T_0> debate un@@ se@@ tt@@ les <T_1> in the 19@@ th <T_6> to <T_7> that <T_2> he@@ bre@@ w scri@@ p@@ tures are <T_4> of a much <T_3> world of <T_5> .
<T_2> the <T_0> we look at <T_4> , <T_1> more <T_3> disappe@@ ars .
<T_0> lives <T_2> upon <T_1> creatures .
<T_3> , i <T_1> this <T_0> ted . <T_2> &apos;s &quot; <T_4> . &quot;
<T_0> now , <T_4> they say <T_8> inf@@ om@@ er@@ ci@@ als , we <T_2> something much <T_7> for you , which we &apos;re working on : <T_1> that <T_6> only <T_3> in@@ ches -- 15 <T_5> -- in <T_9> .
<T_3> astron@@ om@@ ers were <T_1> perhaps they &apos;d <T_2> ker@@ mit the <T_0> .
<T_5> at a <T_1> moment , the <T_3> opened and she <T_4> out <T_2> dres@@ sed , <T_0> com@@ posed .
<T_1> is a typical insu@@ lin <T_0> .
12 <T_0> : in@@ different <T_5> -- <T_6> or <T_2> yet to be determin@@ ed 8 <T_4> deli@@ very : <T_7> ex@@ pul@@ sion stage <T_3> moment <T_8> birth <T_1> you .
and he actually <T_4> one look at <T_0> squ@@ ig@@ gly <T_6> , and <T_5> , &quot; well , why <T_1> &apos;t you just <T_2> the <T_3> ? &quot;
so let &apos;s <T_1> what <T_2> of <T_0> in@@ ventions were .
you &apos;ve got to look at <T_5> out@@ puts , and you got <T_0> say to <T_1> , &quot; what <T_2> i <T_4> to produce that <T_3> output ? &quot;
and <T_1> are <T_0> lo@@ w-@@ power poses .
<T_4> literally what <T_2> &apos;re <T_6> now is the con@@ flu@@ ence of a bunch of <T_9> people , a bunch of <T_1> memories , <T_8> my <T_5> , of <T_3> a <T_7> bit of liber@@ ty <T_0> the subject matter .
<T_0> &apos;re responsible for <T_1> video , &quot; here it <T_2> again . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s just <T_1> problem .
that time <T_1> it@@ ur@@ i forest was created <T_0> a forest <T_2> with <T_4> animals <T_3> also plants .
<T_1> re@@ minds <T_0> that <T_3> know we can do <T_2> .
<T_1> don &apos;t hang with <T_0> because <T_2> eat <T_3> .
<T_4> i got <T_1> lot , <T_2> 30 in <T_0> half an <T_3> .
<T_4> el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate <T_0> made out of <T_2> of different kinds of cell <T_3> being ba@@ th@@ ed in a <T_1> .
<T_0> o@@ ct@@ op@@ us are , <T_2> live in <T_1> the oceans .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> this <T_2> many , many schools .
<T_1> sun is <T_3> , maximum he@@ ating , maximum ev@@ apo@@ ration , maximum <T_4> , maximum <T_0> , <T_5> opportunities for <T_2> .
and <T_0> took schwar@@ z@@ schil@@ d &apos;s <T_4> to the <T_3> acade@@ my <T_1> sci@@ ences the <T_2> week .
so this is <T_6> we <T_0> with 15 years ago , <T_8> the cosmic <T_1> explor@@ er -- made the <T_4> on the upper right , <T_9> basically showed <T_3> that there were lar@@ ge-@@ scale flu@@ ctu@@ ations , and actually <T_7> on <T_2> sc@@ ales . you can kind of <T_5> that .
so it &apos;s what we <T_0> fre@@ el@@ o@@ ading .
in <T_1> , the definition of <T_0> is the <T_4> to read <T_3> write 1,500 chinese <T_2> .
even with all that <T_0> excell@@ ent <T_8> , <T_2> family and <T_9> , suppor@@ tive work <T_6> — i did not make my illness public until <T_5> late in life , and that &apos;s because <T_1> st@@ ig@@ ma against mental illness <T_4> so powerful that <T_3> didn &apos;t feel safe <T_7> people knowing .
<T_1> is <T_0> a 4@@ 0,000 dollar se@@ dan , right ?
but then , <T_7> we shift the di@@ al <T_3> , <T_5> years back , then <T_0> get to the places where the <T_9> are absolutely <T_1> and gor@@ geous , forming <T_2> structures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most <T_4> thing , <T_8> you see between 25 and 50 sharks <T_6> di@@ ve .
but <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> around and look at me <T_1> .
<T_2> they &apos;re <T_1> of the <T_4> , <T_5> &apos;re not co@@ val@@ ently bon@@ ded <T_0> the plastic <T_3> .
don &apos;t read <T_2> bed@@ time <T_1> every <T_0> .
<T_1> we <T_3> they <T_2> all of the <T_0> in the al@@ ham@@ bra ?
<T_1> here <T_2> is un@@ written by <T_0> .
so <T_0> engage <T_1> that conversation <T_3> the <T_5> , we <T_4> to <T_2> the body &apos;s language .
and we <T_1> help them make the <T_2> to <T_3> low carbon <T_0> .
but , little <T_3> i know , <T_5> i <T_2> for <T_0> first <T_4> in a <T_1> reser@@ ve .
<T_1> didn &apos;t <T_0> the part .
but <T_2> doesn &apos;t tell us too <T_4> , <T_1> we <T_3> cl@@ one the <T_0> thing .
<T_2> , <T_3> of mexi@@ can <T_0> is in <T_5> of <T_1> situation we &apos;re going <T_4> .
the <T_3> which are <T_2> &quot; <T_5> earth , &quot; &#91; are &#93; defin@@ itely <T_4> than <T_1> other <T_6> that <T_0> see .
<T_3> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> lot of know@@ -@@ how out <T_0> .
<T_0> . <T_1> ready .
<T_5> something else that happens <T_4> that those ima@@ ge-@@ making <T_2> where you have the pl@@ ot@@ ting of all <T_6> neu@@ ral maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of pur@@ ple that <T_1> see around , <T_3> is the <T_8> cortex , <T_7> you can make recor@@ ds of <T_0> went on in those <T_9> of ima@@ ge-@@ making .
we <T_0> &apos;t have that . so that &apos;s one <T_1> .
but in <T_5> , <T_6> team@@ ed up <T_9> bill jo@@ y@@ ce <T_3> develop <T_2> program that <T_0> read out what was <T_4> the computer screen <T_8> the <T_7> or <T_1> what was on the computer .
so , around <T_4> time <T_8> was studying computer science at <T_1> university , and <T_3> notic@@ ed that it was <T_2> possible to collect these <T_6> of <T_7> arti@@ facts , not <T_9> from street cor@@ ners , but <T_0> from the <T_5> .
<T_5> , <T_2> &apos;d have to <T_3> running away , <T_4> learn to <T_1> like <T_0> , giving no <T_6> that we were there .
construction play -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> , <T_1> , <T_4> also <T_5> powerful <T_0> to learn .
i mean , <T_0> is just <T_1> gold <T_2> .
in <T_1> he talked about <T_2> divided <T_0> .
taking <T_4> is <T_3> , <T_2> bub@@ bl@@ ing in a scan@@ tr@@ on <T_1> not stop <T_0> from <T_5> .
they <T_0> down <T_1> .
<T_0> just wanted to use my <T_2> and build <T_1> school .
&quot; and move <T_1> normal <T_0> . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s called <T_1> .
<T_3> without ski@@ pping a <T_2> at all , he <T_4> , &quot; <T_1> , <T_0> &apos;d be <T_5> the same .
also , every <T_6> you buy gas@@ ol@@ ine in <T_3> united <T_7> , half of it <T_1> actually <T_4> refin@@ ed along <T_2> coast , because the gulf actually has about 50 percent of our <T_0> capacity <T_8> a <T_9> of our marine <T_5> as well .
<T_1> about <T_0> ?
all right , <T_8> one , last <T_5> : shake <T_2> &apos;s hand for six <T_7> , or send <T_6> a <T_3> thank you <T_0> text , email , facebook <T_1> twitter . <T_4> !
but i &apos;m <T_0> . <T_2> &apos;m capable <T_3> thinking <T_1> .
so <T_3> recently <T_1> the <T_2> plan , and it <T_0> appro@@ ved .
<T_5> studied <T_7> the <T_3> things <T_1> had happened in solar cells , and was <T_4> to look for <T_0> we could inno@@ v@@ ate and <T_2> solar cells more <T_6> .
so <T_5> started a <T_4> called <T_0> edi@@ ted <T_7> life@@ edi@@ ted@@ .@@ or@@ g to further <T_2> conversation and to <T_1> some great solutions <T_3> this <T_6> .
and there is a <T_2> of this gene that <T_1> in the <T_0> population .
so <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> example . <T_3> one &apos;s <T_1> more som@@ ber .
<T_6> believe that <T_3> can make a real <T_7> to <T_2> , <T_4> can be emplo@@ yed as a <T_0> ag@@ ent <T_9> understanding the <T_8> and <T_5> facing our <T_1> today .
<T_4> institu@@ tes <T_7> edu@@ ca@@ tional system , with a <T_5> ex@@ cep@@ tions , are <T_2> of producing students in the <T_3> and quality needed <T_6> keep this innovation engine going , <T_0> companies are finding innovative ways to over@@ come this , but in the end <T_1> not ab@@ solve the government <T_8> the responsibility <T_9> creating this edu@@ ca@@ tional structure .
in fact , <T_1> appeared in <T_3> por@@ no com@@ ic <T_5> , which <T_4> the <T_0> on <T_2> right .
so <T_0> actually works ?
and as <T_6> bring these <T_4> together , and as <T_3> think of what <T_5> means to take people who are pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dea@@ f , who <T_2> now begin <T_0> hear -- i mean , <T_7> the <T_1> of hearing aids , right ?
if <T_0> could make new <T_4> in <T_1> sky , <T_2> would <T_3> draw ?
<T_1> this , we make <T_2> and lots of <T_0> .
i mean , <T_5> &apos;s <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> -- <T_0> say <T_2> harv@@ est the <T_4> , you know ?
just have a <T_1> at <T_0> plants .
<T_6> ? but we <T_8> just <T_0> started , the kids <T_7> the technology , <T_2> we called up <T_5> and we <T_4> , &quot; <T_1> got@@ ta learn <T_3> ! &quot;
and <T_0> &apos;s a project that <T_8> just about to open next <T_3> , the <T_4> home for <T_7> d@@ all@@ as theater <T_6> , <T_5> de@@ e <T_2> charles w@@ y@@ ly <T_1> .
so what <T_3> want to share with <T_0> now are some of the <T_6> that <T_5> and my <T_1> have used to <T_4> how <T_7> deal with <T_2> problems .
i <T_1> a <T_2> the other day ; he looked a <T_0> cra@@ zed .
so <T_5> non-@@ le@@ th@@ al <T_4> was being used , in fact , in <T_0> case <T_8> a <T_1> force multi@@ pli@@ er <T_6> make kill@@ ing more <T_3> in <T_7> particular <T_2> .
<T_5> it &apos;s got <T_3> comm@@ ents se@@ ction <T_1> where we can <T_0> comm@@ ents <T_4> the <T_2> .
and i <T_3> to think , how on <T_2> are those kids ever going to <T_1> to write <T_0> ?
the twi@@ st is <T_2> one player , on the left , is in@@ formed about how <T_3> on <T_1> trial there <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> programm@@ ability in these <T_0> .
<T_1> , <T_0> had <T_2> fantastic model for thinking .
<T_1> for the time being , thank <T_0> for that .
you <T_0> ear@@ n 60 <T_4> . <T_3> &apos;t that <T_2> ? yes <T_1> no ? &quot;
oce@@ an@@ ograph@@ er <T_0> s@@ n@@ el@@ gro@@ ve shares <T_4> results of a ten@@ -@@ year project with <T_6> goal : to take <T_8> cen@@ sus of all the life <T_7> the <T_5> . he shares amazing photos <T_3> some of the <T_2> fin@@ ds of the <T_1> of marine <T_9> .
<T_4> , the <T_5> question that you would like to <T_2> is : <T_3> would you like to <T_6> ? <T_0> would you like to <T_1> ?
<T_1> technology <T_2> si@@ mul@@ ating <T_0> .
<T_4> is <T_1> la@@ undry ch@@ ute , and <T_0> right here <T_2> a <T_3> last .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_0> little <T_3> inside , so <T_1> tea is sitting there <T_4> the <T_6> is fil@@ ling it up <T_2> that .
and his mother <T_0> me this <T_2> of coming <T_8> one day -- <T_7> he <T_5> to college <T_6> -- and she said , &quot; <T_4> saw that car , which you can <T_9> recognize , in <T_3> par@@ king lot of a <T_1> , &quot; she said .
so , my clo@@ sing thought .
well , amaz@@ ingly , for once , our world leaders actually lived up to <T_6> millenni@@ um moment <T_5> back in 2000 <T_1> to some <T_7> extraordinary <T_2> : <T_3> , <T_0> , long-term targets <T_4> the millenni@@ um development goals .
you <T_6> click on every <T_1> equ@@ ation and bring up <T_3> little <T_7> to be <T_4> to experiment with it , tin@@ ker with <T_0> , understand it , <T_8> we really don &apos;t understand <T_5> we <T_2> .
he <T_0> little <T_1> for <T_2> son .
there &apos;s <T_0> revolution going on .
independent <T_3> is now estab@@ li@@ shed in <T_6> diplo@@ matic cen@@ ters around <T_8> world , and we &apos;re ad@@ vis@@ ing seven <T_2> eight <T_4> countries , <T_0> political groups , depen@@ ding <T_7> how you wish <T_1> define them -- <T_5> i &apos;m <T_9> big on defini@@ tions .
<T_2> &apos;s still <T_3> of <T_0> of the stuff that &apos;s being done <T_1> .
<T_6> extra <T_1> becomes available -- <T_2> this is what everybody knows <T_5> pic@@ ni@@ cs -- <T_0> extra <T_3> are allo@@ cated to <T_4> the <T_7> .
i like to <T_0> of it <T_2> a <T_1> of technological <T_3> .
that <T_0> my <T_1> .
and <T_2> , everything in <T_0> ca@@ ve has <T_1> .
<T_1> tried to call deep on <T_0> courage .
<T_2> the <T_1> results <T_0> great .
rory <T_0> : <T_1> , natur@@ ally , <T_2> debate <T_3> .
let <T_1> tell you <T_0> thing <T_2> could do .
<T_3> you <T_1> a b@@ out of <T_0> , you &apos;ll go to the <T_2> .
<T_3> 18 <T_0> later -- this <T_6> how innovation happens -- <T_7> months <T_8> , my bo@@ ss said i <T_2> do it on the <T_9> , as <T_1> sort of a play project , k@@ ick the ti@@ res of <T_5> new <T_4> we &apos;d got .
the <T_4> brothers <T_1> day decided <T_0> go on a <T_3> , three <T_2> around the <T_5> .
we <T_1> a space <T_0> at <T_3> and <T_2> it . okay ?
i <T_3> always loved <T_1> and i am <T_0> to be able to condu@@ ct <T_5> own <T_4> with <T_2> new software .
in <T_0> energi@@ zing <T_5> , <T_1> lo@@ v@@ ins la@@ ys out his simple <T_2> for <T_7> the <T_6> off <T_3> and re@@ vit@@ ali@@ zing <T_4> economy .
&quot; <T_1> you &apos;re showing <T_7> true <T_2> , &quot; mom <T_6> . <T_3> thin@@ ks , &quot; why <T_0> he take <T_5> his <T_4> ? &quot;
<T_1> &apos;ve become the <T_0> wr@@ ong@@ ness <T_2> .
<T_4> sol@@ es , i <T_2> we need <T_0> cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um <T_3> big <T_1> .
so <T_9> , you &apos;ve got this <T_8> with this incredible alien landscape <T_2> p@@ ill@@ ars and hot <T_0> and <T_6> and <T_3> , in@@ hab@@ ited by <T_4> very strange <T_7> that live only on <T_1> energy coming <T_5> of the ground .
<T_1> ? there &apos;s <T_0> in <T_2> .
and then <T_3> did <T_2> vari@@ ations of <T_4> , <T_1> it <T_5> wasn &apos;t <T_0> graphi@@ cally at all .
save more tomorrow <T_5> emplo@@ ye@@ es <T_2> save more maybe next <T_6> -- <T_9> in the <T_4> when we <T_7> imagine <T_0> eating ban@@ anas , volunte@@ ering more in the community , <T_8> more and doing <T_1> the right things <T_3> the planet .
<T_7> we <T_5> that <T_3> tens of thousands <T_6> neurons , built digital <T_1> of all the <T_0> types <T_4> neurons we came <T_2> .
this <T_1> a <T_2> of , actually rory <T_0> &apos; gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s <T_3> .
<T_3> &apos;s no <T_0> , there &apos;s no <T_1> , there &apos;s <T_2> non@@ sense .
<T_0> didn &apos;t have the <T_1> .
<T_8> then , <T_1> &apos;ve had the great <T_7> of working <T_6> the googl@@ ers , with do@@ er <T_3> , <T_9> national geographic , with <T_2> of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones <T_4> we could en@@ list , <T_0> put the ocean in <T_5> earth .
he <T_2> a mathemati@@ cian <T_0> a <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;ve got <T_0> about <T_2> to <T_3> these er@@ r@@ ors .
<T_1> can only be <T_3> state of being , <T_2> just <T_4> fle@@ eting <T_0> , sen@@ sation .
it had a <T_1> pro@@ s@@ thetic fit@@ ment <T_4> deli@@ very system , a <T_5> mol@@ ding <T_2> mod@@ ular <T_0> , <T_6> custom@@ -@@ made , on-@@ the-@@ spo@@ t limb <T_3> .
<T_4> han identity <T_0> been the <T_3> which <T_1> held this <T_2> together .
and so what <T_3> &apos;m about to <T_5> you <T_1> an <T_0> represent@@ ation of <T_9> actual dna <T_4> machine that &apos;s <T_2> right <T_6> inside your <T_7> , at <T_8> 2002 biology .
are <T_1> able to say <T_0> a sent@@ ence or two how <T_9> type <T_5> thinking could integra@@ te at <T_8> point to <T_2> like str@@ ing <T_7> or the kind of things <T_6> people think <T_4> as the fundamental <T_3> of the universe ?
<T_3> this is <T_2> to the <T_1> ec@@ ology of the sea <T_0> that it &apos;s <T_4> back out into .
i mean , we all have h@@ d-@@ capable camer@@ as in our po@@ ckets right <T_9> -- most people in <T_6> room , <T_0> bet -- and it &apos;s something that &apos;s -- i never want to forget another <T_7> that <T_5> &apos;ve ever lived , <T_4> this is my <T_3> of doing that , and it &apos;d be really <T_2> also to see , if you could <T_8> type in on a website , &quot; june 18 , 20@@ 18 , &quot; and you would just see <T_1> stream of people &apos;s lives on that particular day from all over the world .

so <T_3> we really need to do <T_8> re@@ gain the <T_2> that it &apos;s our <T_4> sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding <T_7> interests and re@@ gain a <T_6> of unity <T_1> common cause <T_9> our <T_0> that <T_5> has been lost .
do <T_3> even take <T_6> very waste matter that we have <T_7> food and fi@@ ber <T_4> so forth , and turn <T_9> back <T_1> soil and sequ@@ ester <T_2> -- <T_8> carbon <T_0> of the air in the process of using <T_5> cities ?
so <T_3> have <T_0> huge challenge , <T_1> huge <T_2> .
this is actually quite meaningful to me , <T_9> car designers <T_4> to be a little bit <T_1> on the <T_0> pole -- we don &apos;t do coffee table books with just one <T_8> inside <T_7> it -- and cars are thought so much as a product <T_5> it &apos;s a little bit difficult to get into <T_2> aes@@ thetic <T_6> under the <T_3> sort of termin@@ ology that one would discuss art .
they <T_2> into the back of <T_0> truck . they <T_1> off with the <T_3> who re@@ cru@@ its <T_4> .

<T_0> year is <T_1> .
that &apos;s <T_0> long <T_2> you &apos;re <T_1> .
<T_3> that tiny <T_0> pack@@ et of <T_1> is what they use , then , to run their <T_2> .
why <T_0> this <T_5> ? well first <T_3> , <T_4> brain dis@@ or@@ ders , <T_2> is the last thing to <T_1> .
what <T_1> things have in <T_0> is <T_3> kids <T_4> take <T_2> chance .
the <T_3> mat@@ ched <T_1> up because <T_4> share <T_0> love of g@@ ad@@ gets , <T_8> share a love of <T_7> and <T_9> and &apos; 8@@ 0s <T_2> , and so <T_5> agreed to go out <T_6> him .
<T_3> go to the <T_0> and you <T_1> in . there &apos;s a <T_2> .
we have <T_3> challenge , <T_1> the <T_7> population is growing <T_5> this <T_0> from <T_6> billion to <T_8> billion in a very <T_4> amount of time . <T_9> are moving to <T_2> cities .
these inclu@@ de <T_0> , dancing <T_1> pra@@ ying .
<T_2> you <T_1> around , then <T_0> lu@@ ck .
the <T_2> move was <T_1> we <T_0> to try and ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the <T_3> of those <T_4> .
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> very powerful <T_1> . pro@@ gr@@ ession <T_0> powerful .
and you <T_2> measure the performance , <T_3> terms of <T_1> consumption , <T_5> that building against <T_4> typical <T_0> .
<T_0> it &apos;s <T_3> wrong about <T_1> , because <T_4> are not <T_6> able to <T_5> ; they are <T_2> to sense .
it <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> virtual <T_2> .
<T_0> s@@ wa@@ m .
i <T_0> blind , <T_1> couldn &apos;t speak , and i <T_2> &apos;t <T_3> .
it &apos;s been eight <T_2> , and <T_3> can <T_1> you <T_4> i didn &apos;t go to china <T_0> become a law@@ yer .
<T_1> don &apos;t want to <T_3> like <T_9> need to take a <T_6> to get <T_0> moral <T_4> off their <T_7> everyday <T_5> they <T_8> home <T_2> work .
<T_3> was <T_8> enough <T_7> be transpar@@ ent to <T_4> , and <T_0> &apos;s <T_9> we see in the cosmic micro@@ wave <T_1> that george smo@@ ot <T_5> as looking <T_2> the <T_6> of god .

in india <T_1> 1960 , there was a 24 percent <T_2> rate , lots <T_3> people didn &apos;t make it . this is incredibly <T_0> .

<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> of light <T_2> sha@@ do@@ w .

<T_1> what will happen <T_3> is what we <T_0> &quot; the <T_2> fil@@ l-@@ up . &quot;
now <T_0> realize -- i &apos;m not <T_1> -- health <T_2> education -- <T_5> , <T_3> can <T_4> provide that as well .
in <T_4> words , <T_8> have <T_3> hi@@ jack@@ ers -- <T_6> &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four <T_1> ago -- a par@@ asi@@ te that <T_7> the brain and <T_9> even suici@@ d@@ al behavior <T_0> be@@ half of a cause other <T_5> one &apos;s own <T_2> fit@@ ness .

but if it weren &apos;t for <T_6> stran@@ gely <T_5> sto@@ mach@@ -@@ chur@@ ning <T_7> that constantly <T_9> through <T_1> apartment , it <T_3> be <T_8> to <T_4> that you are standing <T_0> to a <T_2> and on top of a land@@ fill .
and <T_1> rest of the <T_3> they &apos;re free to ro@@ am around <T_5> &apos;s land <T_2> eat <T_0> they <T_4> .

these <T_1> can <T_0> us .
if <T_4> want to know about <T_9> , <T_1> our <T_8> -- and <T_3> just &quot; things <T_5> apart , &quot; because that would <T_2> like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the <T_0> &apos; and so <T_6> know everything about <T_7> . &quot;
obviously , <T_4> &apos;m having a <T_2> life , <T_5> -- -- the <T_0> is , what <T_6> all of this <T_3> for <T_1> ?
but before <T_5> do that , i <T_3> to talk <T_4> you <T_2> synthetic <T_8> like <T_6> , which requi@@ re huge amo@@ un@@ ts of <T_1> to create <T_9> , because of <T_7> dis@@ pos@@ al issues , are slowly po@@ is@@ on@@ ing <T_0> planet .
now , the machine is -- in <T_4> case , it &apos;s a real <T_0> of that , because obviously <T_3> can &apos;t move physical matter <T_2> speed and have <T_5> <T_1> inst@@ ant@@ an@@ eously .
just before <T_2> jump into <T_3> , there &apos;s sort of a <T_1> of : <T_0> is <T_4> important ?
<T_2> she <T_1> , &quot; <T_3> . <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> such thing . &quot;
living <T_9> your <T_2> is the <T_4> of our species , and you <T_1> an <T_5> human being , <T_3> you &apos;re <T_6> , going back <T_8> and thousands and thousands <T_0> years , and that &apos;s now starting to <T_7> understood .
and <T_4> of the <T_0> there , attemp@@ ting to be <T_5> and <T_2> -- maybe not <T_1> , <T_3> succe@@ eding .
<T_3> it &apos;s very hard <T_0> find <T_6> eth@@ ic@@ ist who consi@@ ders any change <T_2> making , <T_7> he <T_4> , <T_5> about the <T_1> ?
<T_1> &apos;s a huge <T_2> for <T_0> development .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> &apos; clock .
<T_8> it <T_5> me that if i <T_3> write stories that <T_2> this world as being small <T_4> inter@@ connected , that maybe i could <T_7> people <T_9> in the <T_6> that <T_0> us <T_1> , and maybe engage them to make a difference .
<T_0> . <T_2> you see <T_1> pattern ?
<T_1> they are <T_0> .
<T_1> was <T_0> , <T_3> it covered only 20 <T_4> of the <T_2> .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> back to that .
and <T_2> is a <T_4> that <T_0> are <T_3> really <T_1> of that much .
it <T_0> . <T_1> is going on <T_2> .
<T_2> that <T_0> what lin@@ ked <T_1> is all about .

<T_0> val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day is coming up <T_5> a couple of <T_1> , <T_2> these are currently <T_6> in <T_4> all around <T_3> world .
and that &apos;s where it &apos;s actually also <T_0> to think about , <T_2> does 40@@ 4 <T_1> from ?
of <T_1> , <T_3> can &apos;t <T_0> what &apos;s going to happen and we <T_2> to live with <T_4> .
<T_1> the art <T_3> conversation <T_5> being replac@@ ed -- danger@@ ously , <T_2> think -- <T_4> personal <T_0> .
<T_4> speaking of <T_2> , <T_5> notice <T_3> i <T_1> bro@@ a@@ den@@ ed <T_0> discussion .
<T_3> then of course there was sha@@ h <T_1> playing <T_0> kol@@ kat@@ a <T_2> .
<T_1> wind , there &apos;s <T_0> larger area , <T_3> much smaller <T_2> .
i stopped doing <T_1> about six <T_0> ago <T_5> became <T_4> ful@@ l-@@ time writer , <T_2> many people <T_3> .

<T_3> few <T_5> ago , <T_0> vac@@ la@@ v <T_2> tried <T_4> calculate the prob@@ ability <T_7> sudden dis@@ ast@@ ers large <T_6> to change <T_1> .

and <T_2> some che@@ ery <T_3> usually <T_0> pi@@ pes up and <T_4> , &quot; <T_1> , don &apos;t forget <T_5> pla@@ gu@@ es . &quot;

the <T_0> was inside <T_2> house and it <T_1> awesome .

and a <T_1> years ago , i was <T_5> in <T_3> a@@ vi@@ v and <T_4> saw this <T_8> on a wall , and <T_0> found it so comp@@ elling that by now <T_7> pre@@ ach it to my <T_9> , and <T_2> &apos;d like to try to pre@@ ach it <T_6> you .
and it <T_0> robert kenne@@ dy &apos;s beautiful <T_1> of why gross national <T_2> so little : it <T_8> does not allow for <T_5> health <T_9> our children <T_6> the <T_4> of their education , or the <T_3> of their play <T_7>

see what &apos;s really puzz@@ ling <T_1> fru@@ str@@ ating about <T_6> last <T_5> , <T_2> me , is that <T_3> first <T_0> miles are <T_7> about <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s the wrong <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;ve got to come up and see <T_0> .
we lived <T_0> less <T_1> a dollar <T_3> day <T_4> about 15 <T_2> .

do you want to <T_0> it ?
<T_4> these <T_1> pri@@ ces are available <T_2> the 25 <T_5> where <T_7> work , <T_6> in a total of <T_0> countries , <T_9> about 5@@ 50,000 <T_8> are getting the benef@@ its of <T_3> .
zero <T_0> to engage the generation <T_3> today and <T_2> , <T_4> various stories <T_1> different <T_5> .
but <T_1> had always felt like , look , you <T_9> , <T_5> made the <T_4> choice <T_3> could make <T_0> who i <T_2> then , <T_7> the <T_6> i had on <T_8> .
he <T_1> said , &quot; <T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> everything . &quot;
<T_2> that &apos;s what <T_1> try to <T_0> .
<T_1> del@@ hi , we used to live -- <T_0> used to call <T_2> a ch@@ hat <T_4> the <T_3> .
<T_4> june the nin@@ th , <T_3> , <T_5> got the first <T_2> from the <T_8> trial <T_7> this vac@@ cine , <T_1> it <T_6> out to <T_0> a g@@ am@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger .
some <T_1> them will be cop@@ i@@ ed <T_0> though <T_3> &apos;re <T_2> .
<T_5> , in <T_1> sense , the <T_2> that <T_4> has a <T_0> is not that <T_3> .
but <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> just <T_1> car@@ bon@@ ate produ@@ cers that are affected .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> sure that <T_3> have happened <T_0> the <T_2> had not been a <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_3> map made <T_1> mark <T_5> who &apos;s down the <T_4> at the ox@@ ford <T_0> institute .
<T_4> think it &apos;s <T_3> the only <T_1> in <T_2> , but possibly the <T_0> .
<T_1> think you &apos;re a person who believ@@ es in <T_0> leg@@ acy .
so without <T_2> technology , our <T_0> would not <T_1> .
so those <T_1> examples <T_0> positive <T_2> .
so , thank <T_0> . <T_2> person , another <T_1> .
and those <T_1> act like a <T_0> for <T_2> .
<T_5> &apos;re also <T_3> for brains in which <T_1> can get the tissue , we can get con@@ sent to take <T_0> tissue <T_4> 24 hours of time of <T_2> .
<T_1> the <T_4> can &apos;t <T_0> , <T_5> look for <T_3> things to distra@@ ct <T_2> attention .
<T_6> one <T_1> that i think <T_2> very <T_8> , which many <T_7> you may <T_0> now that <T_3> &apos;ve <T_9> microbes <T_4> the crowd , is something that i would call &quot; <T_5> . &quot;
oh <T_1> ? <T_0> not ?
because <T_5> feel like , you <T_0> , <T_1> are so <T_3> images out <T_4> , so many <T_2> out there .
<T_5> we <T_1> it to look at atoms , at <T_6> atoms , so <T_2> we <T_4> read the <T_0> from <T_3> and after .
<T_5> give <T_3> a quick <T_4> on where we are , <T_1> quick re@@ fres@@ her on <T_0> we <T_2> .
<T_1> first <T_0> ? well , there &apos;s <T_2> there .
does <T_1> make a difference <T_2> war@@ ri@@ ors go to <T_3> changing their <T_0> or <T_4> ?
<T_9> don &apos;t <T_2> home at the end of the day and think , &quot; well , i <T_4> know <T_6> i <T_5> now <T_8> the <T_7> street journ@@ al says <T_3> the stock <T_0> closed at this many <T_1> . &quot;
the <T_2> s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ed <T_0> bra@@ ves . <T_3> : <T_1> .
<T_1> somehow , <T_2> some dynamic <T_4> , <T_5> &apos;re having these <T_3> which <T_0> being , you know , em@@ it@@ ted from it .
these are <T_0> clo@@ cks , and <T_6> &apos;re found <T_4> every <T_2> being that has <T_3> or more <T_1> and in some that <T_5> have one cell .
so after <T_3> days of <T_1> the <T_4> passage -- <T_2> &apos;t that <T_0> .
zero <T_1> a <T_0> .
i <T_5> , <T_6> you <T_3> a <T_1> up in britain <T_4> saying , &quot; g@@ d@@ p fell <T_2> percent this <T_7> . good <T_0> !

so <T_7> comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te , i &apos;d <T_4> the <T_1> ti@@ ghter , and <T_2> pro@@ gr@@ essi@@ vely made <T_5> shake <T_3> , so <T_6> &apos;d hold the pen <T_0> still .

<T_0> don &apos;t have that , but <T_1> another <T_3> . <T_2> you for coming <T_4> ted .
<T_0> all it took <T_2> change <T_3> around was to allow for choice <T_1> rights <T_4> .
so that &apos;s what you see <T_0> .
and <T_9> &apos;s <T_6> of the <T_3> why <T_7> ander@@ sen <T_4> to laun@@ ch ac@@ cent@@ ure <T_2> than try <T_1> per@@ su@@ ade the world that <T_8> &apos;s could stand <T_5> something other <T_0> accoun@@ tan@@ cy .
but i <T_0> to take you <T_3> one <T_5> that &apos;s particularly <T_1> to <T_4> , and <T_2> &apos;s the <T_6> .
<T_1> strategy <T_0> we have <T_4> is actually <T_2> use dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed <T_3> .
therefore <T_1> &apos;s the <T_3> pres@@ erve of an <T_2> , <T_0> body .
he <T_0> was <T_3> inten@@ ding to work in <T_1> research , but <T_5> couldn &apos;t really find <T_4> alternative <T_2> job .
i &apos;m notic@@ ing that <T_3> &apos;s happening all over the <T_1> , and <T_2> good <T_0> is <T_4> it &apos;s growing .
you know , <T_1> is <T_3> , where <T_0> magic <T_2> .

and <T_1> the se@@ di@@ ment is then put through <T_5> scre@@ ens , and where <T_8> go <T_3> through it very <T_4> , looking <T_6> small <T_2> , and <T_7> &apos;s then <T_0> .
and <T_2> could <T_1> quite a <T_0> to come from this .
<T_4> is <T_2> letting patients <T_1> a more <T_5> role in <T_0> health care , in <T_3> health care .
well , <T_6> vision <T_4> to re@@ disco@@ ver <T_5> spirit of the <T_1> , create <T_2> new <T_8> where <T_0> for <T_3> her@@ it@@ age is actually a symbol of <T_7> art and <T_9> together .
<T_1> are just <T_3> , remarkable changes in <T_2> out@@ look for some of <T_0> biggest <T_4> .
<T_2> after pie@@ cing <T_1> this , this and this , this way of actually trying <T_0> figure out <T_6> happened for <T_7> eventually <T_4> into this , and it actually <T_5> this <T_3> .
<T_5> these <T_6> leaders who really are looking at <T_4> and exten@@ ding <T_3> to <T_2> 70 <T_0> of <T_9> who make <T_8> than two dollars a day , provide real <T_1> to <T_7> .
this <T_0> : &quot; having &quot; -- <T_5> is the <T_3> thing ; <T_1> &apos;s just , you know , photographed <T_4> the <T_2> .
<T_3> we made <T_6> of our autos <T_9> way , it <T_8> save <T_5> equivalent to finding <T_4> and <T_2> half sau@@ di arab@@ i@@ as , <T_7> half an op@@ e@@ c , by <T_1> in the de@@ troit formation , a very pro@@ spe@@ ctive <T_0> .
<T_0> you . thank you very much .
<T_6> &apos;s a natural <T_5> for bringing <T_3> together , <T_2> ideas -- in the <T_7> way <T_1> &apos;re doing <T_0> at <T_4> .
and <T_2> was getting a <T_1> in the <T_0> caf@@ e .
<T_5> , <T_1> turns out we can do <T_3> much the same kind <T_0> thing <T_4> the compu@@ ta@@ tional <T_2> .
are <T_3> serious about it , <T_8> not <T_5> , <T_0> know , when <T_7> consum@@ ers <T_1> it , when <T_4> regul@@ ators force us <T_2> do it we will <T_6> there ?
and then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the <T_0> , <T_2> learned paraly@@ sis <T_5> over into <T_1> body image and <T_4> your phan@@ tom , <T_3> ?
so , they <T_2> their work <T_1> kit@@ tens , with different <T_3> of <T_4> , and <T_6> studies <T_5> which <T_8> back to the &apos; 60s , are now <T_7> app@@ lied to human <T_0> .

<T_1> had the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars <T_3> cla@@ es , and i <T_4> them <T_0> , and i could <T_2> get <T_6> of <T_5> after that .

<T_2> are <T_3> things involved -- <T_0> parts to the <T_1> .
<T_2> things were <T_0> important to me but <T_1> necessarily de@@ al-@@ break@@ ers .
this <T_1> by the jo@@ k@@ we people of <T_0> tells the <T_2> of the <T_3> of the <T_4> .
<T_2> the <T_0> part about that is <T_4> the <T_1> , <T_7> it <T_3> you have to <T_8> up , you have to show <T_6> stuff to <T_5> world .
you &apos;ll have inter@@ n@@ al <T_0> for <T_2> rest of your <T_1> .
there was <T_5> a statement made by a <T_0> that <T_4> that 80 <T_2> of the pur@@ suit <T_3> happiness is <T_1> just <T_7> the <T_8> , and it &apos;s as difficult to become <T_9> as it is to become <T_6> .
i <T_2> i had that when <T_1> was in <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;re facing this <T_0> .
<T_2> was <T_1> ma@@ ster mechan@@ ic , and <T_3> taught <T_4> how to use <T_0> .
<T_6> co@@ p says , &quot; <T_2> you <T_4> ? hey <T_1> , <T_5> you <T_0> you <T_3> your keys here ? &quot;
start all <T_0> .
<T_3> if we place <T_0> technologies before <T_7> in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , we can be <T_6> ourselves <T_5> our <T_2> tool <T_1> teachers : <T_4> students &apos; questions .
<T_3> actually goes way <T_2> , <T_0> what <T_5> want to suggest <T_1> it goes <T_4> long way back .
<T_3> if that <T_0> could <T_4> enough to <T_2> net contribu@@ tors , <T_1> pl@@ under@@ ers ?
and it &apos;s made <T_2> in <T_0> difficult <T_1> times .
and one of <T_1> is <T_2> l@@ ac@@ king <T_0> power .

then <T_2> opened it up to creating <T_0> that was <T_1> natur@@ ally .

on janu@@ ary <T_0> , app@@ le <T_1> will introduce <T_2> .
so <T_4> we actually won the <T_0> we <T_5> to do an <T_3> in <T_1> expla@@ ining the <T_2> .
<T_1> they also succeed <T_0> the job of <T_2> .
now , can <T_0> own this <T_1> ?
and what i did , <T_1> gave <T_4> just <T_0> that <T_3> care for <T_2> .
i <T_1> them what <T_0> of building <T_2> was .
the first number <T_1> three : <T_0> billion <T_2> .
<T_5> , they &apos;re going to create an <T_2> regi@@ ster of <T_9> land <T_8> they &apos;ve got , put it <T_3> a <T_4> bank <T_0> that communities can <T_6> that wher@@ ever they live , and they &apos;re going to <T_7> that with a <T_1> .
<T_1> you <T_3> that , your <T_0> becomes <T_2> .
they spend 500 dollars <T_2> every one dollar -- 500 dollars <T_7> fo@@ ods <T_6> kids <T_5> &apos;t eat <T_4> every <T_3> dollar <T_1> healthy , <T_0> food .
but we need <T_2> be very <T_0> about how <T_3> that <T_1> .
and <T_3> having to know history &apos;s next mad <T_1> or <T_2> , it might <T_0> a <T_4> .

one <T_0> recent case <T_9> we &apos;ve investig@@ ated is <T_6> the <T_2> in the <T_5> re@@ public of con@@ go sold off <T_7> series <T_4> valuable , stat@@ e-@@ ow@@ ned min@@ ing as@@ sets to <T_8> companies <T_3> the <T_1> virg@@ in is@@ lands .

and <T_6> told <T_1> the other people , and she <T_7> , &quot; how <T_3> it possibly be <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> and simple works as well <T_8> <T_0> that &apos;s <T_2> and expensive ? <T_9>
<T_4> they engine@@ ered <T_1> cells so <T_3> when they &apos;re growing <T_2> the exponenti@@ al phase , they would sm@@ ell <T_0> w@@ inter@@ green .
<T_2> so it was <T_3> day <T_0> we decided <T_1> needed to build a crisis text <T_4> .
and <T_2> are <T_0> kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my <T_1> .
<T_9> in 2002 , when <T_4> tour came to an <T_6> , <T_2> decided <T_5> wasn &apos;t going to go back <T_7> the <T_1> that was <T_3> for <T_8> in <T_0> .

it &apos;s still <T_1> its way up the food <T_0> .

and <T_7> around that <T_5> , <T_1> the <T_9> &apos;s , that <T_2> saw women and heart disease <T_8> going up , up , up , up , up , she wrote <T_0> edi@@ tori@@ al in <T_6> new <T_3> journ@@ al <T_4> medicine and said , the y@@ ent@@ l syn@@ dro@@ me .

<T_3> we can wra@@ p <T_4> heads <T_9> the <T_7> , <T_6> that &apos;s what <T_5> see here , but in <T_2> , <T_0> guys <T_8> live in a <T_1> zone .

so , i <T_9> have about <T_1> more years left <T_8> this <T_7> -- on this <T_5> of the <T_0> , but after <T_3> years , i really <T_4> like i know <T_2> &apos;s at the heart of <T_6> work .

what i <T_0> saying though is that human beings are <T_1> one-@@ dimensional .
we <T_2> &apos;t <T_4> specifically <T_3> particles will be produced <T_0> any individual <T_1> .
<T_5> , <T_6> , <T_3> idea of <T_1> able to put sound <T_4> you <T_2> to is really starting <T_0> catch on .
and <T_8> objects which were used as <T_4> , <T_3> i was a <T_0> and a <T_2> , as examples of <T_5> break <T_6> mathematics and visible reality -- those <T_7> , <T_1> turned them completely <T_9> .
<T_2> of course , i <T_0> to know <T_3> i <T_1> doing that .

<T_9> may <T_6> be pus@@ hing the <T_0> out too far to <T_3> that <T_8> teachers are <T_7> significant <T_2> expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy <T_5> teaching <T_4> environ@@ ments like that day <T_1> day .
we <T_0> from <T_3> percent urban to <T_2> percent by the <T_1> post@@ war years .
that &apos;s basically all we &apos;re going <T_0> be talking about here .
given ra@@ w <T_6> or data to <T_4> answer <T_8> , one <T_3> to compu@@ te : one has to <T_1> all those <T_9> and models and <T_2> and <T_5> on <T_7> science and other <T_0> have built up over the centuries .
<T_6> yet black <T_3> may be heard even <T_7> they &apos;re not <T_5> , and <T_0> &apos;s because <T_2> ban@@ g <T_4> spac@@ e-@@ time like <T_1> drum .
&quot; <T_1> the <T_0> . &quot;
<T_9> partici@@ pan@@ ts <T_8> impro@@ v <T_5> events have just as <T_1> lei@@ sure time as <T_2> other new <T_6> , they <T_3> occasi@@ on@@ ally <T_4> to <T_0> it <T_7> an unusual way .
<T_3> nothing , <T_4> prepared <T_0> for what i was <T_2> hear on <T_5> first of <T_1> 2008 .
<T_5> like to think of <T_6> as <T_1> mes@@ h <T_4> civili@@ zations , <T_2> which the <T_0> of different <T_3> are inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed .
and <T_1> , <T_5> ri@@ ghtly , <T_2> were saying <T_6> is about finding <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> with you . spo@@ t <T_3> lo@@ ony .

<T_1> &apos;re at a particular <T_0> .
i had <T_0> vegetable car@@ vers work on <T_1> for <T_2> .
and this started <T_9> incredible <T_7> with <T_3> , and <T_0> six <T_5> , we were testing <T_6> new <T_8> vac@@ cine that tar@@ ge@@ ted , just two <T_4> ago , the last two <T_2> in <T_1> world .
this <T_1> me <T_3> the <T_0> making <T_2> .
and if <T_1> find that thing , maybe there <T_0> a big f@@ at <T_2> prize out there .
the three of us <T_2> to <T_0> ex@@ am together , and <T_3> sit <T_1> .
<T_0> if you &apos;re <T_3> , &apos; cause <T_2> &apos;s ten@@ ds to run <T_1> families .

right now the <T_8> position about when a new technology comes <T_0> , is we -- people talk about the prec@@ au@@ tion@@ ary principle , which is very common <T_2> europe , which <T_5> , basically , &quot; don &apos;t do <T_7> . <T_1> you meet a <T_4> technology , <T_3> , <T_6> it can be pro@@ ven that there &apos;s no <T_9> . &quot;
<T_2> was <T_1> . i heard &quot; <T_3> , <T_0> . &quot;
<T_3> &apos;s that will to <T_6> , <T_5> need <T_1> survive , to <T_2> itself , that comes in a <T_7> , <T_8> takes over <T_0> like <T_4> .
giving <T_0> life away .
you <T_2> &apos;t <T_3> this stuff . <T_0> &apos;s really <T_1> to me .
ultimately , we <T_0> live in <T_5> world <T_4> not by <T_1> , <T_3> by <T_2> .
it <T_1> re@@ a@@ ches <T_2> ground where it <T_0> meant for .
<T_0> what it <T_3> to <T_2> things like <T_1> .

<T_1> i said , &quot; dr. <T_3> , <T_6> my dau@@ gh@@ ters <T_5> to you one <T_2> and <T_8> , &apos; <T_7> should i learn <T_9> my da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s story ? &apos; what <T_4> you <T_0> them ? &quot;
so <T_5> have to be <T_4> to having your <T_3> shared , <T_7> is a much <T_0> step than <T_1> sharing your web <T_2> , <T_6> your <T_8> .
<T_1> that , you could not have any of <T_2> other <T_3> innova@@ tions <T_0> .
<T_0> can change the <T_2> we see <T_1> world .
<T_5> is how , for <T_4> , four <T_0> states in 2010 <T_1> 4@@ 3 <T_3> 5@@ 2 <T_2> wind <T_6> .

and , finally , compare <T_0> c <T_2> d : c <T_1> d both have <T_3> friends .
<T_0> i now would like <T_2> to &#91; put &#93; your seat bel@@ ts <T_1> and put your hat@@ s &#91; on &#93; .

now , it <T_3> really interesting <T_1> you then add <T_4> ai <T_2> the <T_0> part of the body as well .
now , we &apos;ve seen a <T_9> of examples of <T_7> who <T_5> pur@@ su@@ ing that <T_0> of vision in science , but <T_2> think <T_6> &apos;s also true in the <T_3> , it &apos;s true in <T_4> , <T_1> &apos;s even true in personal <T_8> .

<T_5> , origami <T_1> the structures that we &apos;ve developed <T_2> origami turn out to have <T_8> in <T_7> , in <T_4> , <T_6> space , in the <T_3> , <T_9> electron@@ ics <T_0> more .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> because <T_0> is <T_1> the chance for comp@@ lication and opportunity .

so <T_1> that influ@@ ences how ocean surface waters mix <T_3> the deep water <T_2> the <T_4> of <T_0> planet .
and <T_4> , <T_3> all <T_5> ge@@ ar , we were for@@ ced to ri@@ de out in <T_2> middle of the night , in <T_1> quite <T_0> scene .
<T_0> you .
<T_2> &apos;re like every big <T_1> in the <T_0> .
even when <T_2> japanese <T_1> pe@@ ar@@ l h@@ arb@@ or , <T_0> least they <T_3> back .
<T_1> was <T_0> .
<T_2> material actually has some <T_1> that <T_4> it seem almost <T_0> good to be <T_3> .
we <T_2> to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights <T_3> because of the other things it <T_0> , <T_4> women &apos;s rights <T_1> for the other things it brings .
<T_7> inten@@ tionally <T_1> people psych@@ ologi@@ cally , to <T_4> people physi@@ cally , to <T_3> people <T_5> , or <T_6> , <T_0> to com@@ mit <T_2> against humanity .
in <T_3> other <T_2> the cars <T_1> only move <T_0> and back .
but you don &apos;t <T_4> to have to res@@ et the <T_1> machine <T_2> the <T_0> car at the <T_3> doesn &apos;t <T_5> , <T_6> .
bringing them <T_1> life , bringing them <T_0> light .
<T_0> , it &apos;s <T_3> difficult to get <T_2> to be <T_1> .
an ir@@ a dri@@ ver was <T_3> , <T_4> his <T_5> plo@@ wed <T_2> people on the <T_1> of the <T_0> .
this <T_6> a picture that <T_3> g@@ ore gave <T_5> a few years <T_0> that he took when he <T_8> in the <T_9> a <T_7> , long <T_2> ago , <T_4> the <T_1> fle@@ ets of the ar@@ al sea .
<T_4> has <T_1> 6@@ 0,000 <T_3> on it , <T_2> we <T_0> measure various genes of the 25@@ ,000 genes in the <T_5> .
now <T_9> situation , already i -- you know , <T_6> don &apos;t really like thinking <T_4> this , although <T_0> i got myself a job where i have to think <T_2> it . so <T_5> point <T_8> that we &apos;re very , very <T_1> in <T_3> of developing this <T_7> .
&quot; <T_1> like the <T_0> , <T_2> ! <T_3> ! &quot;
now , he gets <T_7> f-@@ shar@@ p , and finally he <T_6> down <T_1> e , <T_2> it &apos;s the <T_0> ch@@ ord -- because the ch@@ ord he &apos;s <T_3> for is <T_8> one , and <T_4> he <T_5> ...
so <T_6> do <T_4> that leads up to <T_5> , but then <T_0> get there . <T_1> figure we &apos;ve made it , we <T_7> back in our <T_2> zone , and we actually stop <T_8> everything <T_3> made us <T_9> .
<T_1> are <T_2> country <T_0> vi@@ cti@@ ms .
<T_6> was <T_0> kind of un@@ inten@@ ded positive feedback loo@@ p between <T_3> way <T_7> people walked <T_2> the <T_1> the <T_4> began to move , that engineers <T_5> nothing about .
<T_4> more importantly , it <T_0> lin@@ ked <T_1> to the <T_3> no@@ tions of <T_2> ge@@ ograph@@ y .
<T_7> that are <T_0> markets , <T_5> it with <T_1> principles of <T_6> , <T_2> , <T_3> ages , <T_4> .
and then in <T_3> , <T_5> map satellite was <T_6> -- <T_4> w@@ map -- <T_0> it <T_2> somewhat <T_1> pictures .
so to <T_7> tun@@ isi@@ an <T_6> agency , and <T_2> like it all <T_1> the <T_3> world , <T_0> equ@@ aled extre@@ mis@@ m , bin <T_4> &apos;s <T_5> had become <T_8> .
and <T_3> it &apos;s just <T_4> to a <T_1> of spo@@ ts <T_2> ne@@ p@@ al and <T_0> .
and <T_1> didn &apos;t start <T_0> the <T_2> places .
<T_3> has <T_7> be <T_1> to come <T_4> of <T_6> cen@@ ter@@ line <T_5> then <T_0> able to work back toward that <T_2> .
<T_2> ima@@ gery of god is <T_3> being , absolute <T_5> and <T_0> and wisdom and <T_1> compassion <T_4> love .
and the information <T_8> there twice -- one on each strand -- <T_2> is <T_3> , because <T_7> new <T_5> are formed , <T_4> strands come apart , new strands are synthesi@@ zed with the <T_9> ones as tem@@ plates <T_1> an <T_6> perfect <T_0> .
but i should <T_0> talk <T_1> five , right ? &quot; <T_3> is <T_2> . &quot;
one <T_0> do it <T_3> a <T_8> person , or as a finance person , or a <T_2> person , or as an enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment person , <T_4> every one <T_1> us <T_6> all of <T_7> things and <T_5> .
<T_3> , i would <T_1> that <T_4> don &apos;t think <T_2> , we <T_0> replic@@ ators .
<T_1> ran <T_0> .
tomorrow , <T_8> am going to <T_1> , and i &apos;m <T_7> moved that i <T_9> be <T_0> women <T_5> ca@@ ir@@ o who are v-day <T_4> , who are opening <T_3> first <T_6> house for batter@@ ed women in the middle <T_2> .
<T_0> we have people <T_1> together in <T_2> time ?
<T_7> &apos;s been <T_0> to leave <T_1> nations because <T_2> have trans@@ formed <T_5> face <T_6> hunger <T_4> their <T_3> .
so <T_0> is <T_1> .
so <T_4> brings <T_5> to the first <T_2> that i &apos;ll raise <T_1> morning , which is how do <T_6> stop a <T_0> disease that &apos;s spread by <T_3> ?
no <T_0> means <T_7> can <T_2> them up and they &apos;re <T_8> going to be a <T_4> risk , and <T_6> &apos;re not going to have <T_3> nuclear material <T_1> radi@@ ological <T_5> pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ated from their <T_9> .
<T_0> it <T_3> a <T_2> that can be energi@@ zed <T_1> nur@@ tured .
a <T_0> pris@@ on camp .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> by making autos <T_0> free .
<T_6> from here , we &apos;re <T_5> to do the <T_4> sorts of <T_2> , <T_1> only of still <T_3> , but also <T_0> video .
<T_4> : ai@@ me@@ e <T_3> the designer of them will <T_0> at ted@@ med <T_1> , and <T_2> &apos;ll talk about <T_6> design of <T_5> .
to <T_1> , this is <T_0> an information age , <T_3> &apos;s an <T_2> of net@@ worked intelligence .
<T_1> art , <T_0> later <T_2> , isn &apos;t explained <T_3> a <T_5> story <T_4> mine .
so richard sau@@ l <T_2> has <T_1> a 15 <T_4> google <T_3> of <T_0> ted conference .
so for five <T_0> now , that &apos;s <T_3> we are <T_1> , <T_6> , <T_2> , a <T_4> of my friends , <T_7> just making <T_5> .
the last <T_0> age started <T_1> 1@@ 20,000 <T_2> ago .
<T_3> they -- and they <T_1> these big <T_8> where <T_7> try to figure out how we &apos;re going to -- how we &apos;re going to continu@@ ally prove <T_0> the planet is getting <T_9> , <T_6> that &apos;s actually <T_2> to <T_4> people &apos;s <T_5> .
it &apos;s <T_1> that <T_0> us help <T_2> people .
or <T_2> it a <T_3> of seren@@ di@@ p@@ ity <T_4> we <T_0> explain , <T_5> the <T_1> const@@ ant ?
<T_5> should <T_6> that <T_1> far advan@@ ced <T_4> notice one might <T_0> about something depen@@ ds on <T_2> ho@@ st of <T_3> .
now , i &apos;m <T_6> you the <T_2> of a piece that <T_7> about <T_5> in some ways <T_8> and also -- oh , <T_3> , <T_4> you &apos;re bor@@ ed , <T_9> here , here &apos;s one <T_1> for it .
f@@ las@@ h@@ -@@ forward <T_5> the <T_0> year <T_2> &quot; <T_7> book <T_1> awesome &quot; has <T_4> been <T_3> one on <T_6> best@@ s@@ eller list for 20 straight weeks .
he needed to <T_0> a <T_2> sym@@ pa@@ thetic <T_1> .
<T_0> , al@@ mon@@ d-@@ shaped , un@@ blin@@ king <T_1> ?
<T_1> , <T_0> .
so a <T_3> big en@@ dea@@ vor , <T_0> we <T_2> on <T_1> dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers .
<T_2> says : &quot; <T_1> clean <T_0> all . &quot; .
if we <T_8> at <T_2> re@@ turns to labor , <T_0> other words total wa@@ ges paid out <T_9> the <T_1> , we <T_6> them <T_3> an all@@ -@@ time low <T_7> head@@ ing very <T_5> in the <T_4> direction .

and <T_2> think , &quot; <T_1> &apos;m sitting <T_0> to lewis <T_3> . &quot;
this <T_5> exp@@ ands <T_6> adul@@ tho@@ od <T_3> becomes sort of <T_4> ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn dis@@ gu@@ st response , no <T_0> just <T_8> whether or not we &apos;re about to be po@@ is@@ oned , <T_9> whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical cont@@ am@@ ination from some <T_2> . but <T_1> face rema@@ ins stri@@ k@@ ingly <T_7> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> great challenge for <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;t have to <T_1> about <T_0> money .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_6> big <T_8> . it <T_2> big , <T_9> sounds <T_4> , <T_1> sounds <T_7> . it <T_3> american . ball@@ sy , serious , <T_0> .
<T_2> gates : <T_3> state <T_0> are breaking <T_1> schools
so think , this <T_1> a serious <T_0> .
this <T_0> a <T_1> us@@ b key .
if <T_3> think <T_0> the last <T_1> , i dun@@ no , you had a <T_2> to@@ oth .
is <T_0> change , though , a <T_3> change , <T_5> is it a <T_4> of the <T_2> of the patient <T_1> ?
the <T_0> thing that you need to do when you have an <T_2> scri@@ pt <T_1> try to figure out the direction of <T_3> .
but <T_1> , <T_0> are re@@ building r@@ wand@@ a .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> a balance between <T_2> visible and the <T_1> in <T_4> .
it <T_0> for <T_9> from the government <T_5> us@@ er-@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed <T_4> for energ@@ y-@@ efficient <T_3> , difficult to <T_6> , and <T_7> i had no <T_8> what it was when <T_2> went into the work@@ shop , but quickly <T_1> .
this <T_1> not <T_0> population , <T_3> is <T_2> .
<T_1> is one <T_2> the <T_0> public health problems .
especially here in <T_0> , <T_2> you try <T_5> make a break@@ fast <T_1> , and you <T_3> , &quot; <T_6> about <T_4> o &apos;@@ clock ? &quot;
<T_0> they <T_1> &quot; <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> minutes . &quot;
we <T_2> scientific <T_3> , <T_1> prote@@ stant re@@ formation , <T_5> democra@@ cies possible <T_4> they had not been <T_0> before .
<T_0> 14@@ -year-old kid would <T_1> : &quot; oh , well ... &quot;
<T_4> best way to <T_3> about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell <T_9> a story <T_6> work and play and <T_1> four aspe@@ cts <T_5> life <T_7> we need to <T_8> in order for <T_0> own crea@@ tivity to <T_2> .
this <T_0> says , &quot; bu@@ co@@ lic <T_1> with spli@@ t-@@ ra@@ il f@@ ence .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
keep shoot &apos; n . keep shoot &apos; n .
so <T_6> idea of being able <T_5> use <T_8> technology to <T_4> up with paper where i can hand@@ le sort <T_7> sounds <T_3> little <T_0> , <T_2> i <T_1> it still <T_9> its place .
so we <T_9> that in pri@@ mate hierarch@@ ies , <T_1> an alpha <T_2> to take over , if <T_6> individual needs to take over an <T_0> role sort of suddenly , <T_8> a few <T_4> , that individual &apos;s te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one has gone up significantly <T_5> his cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l <T_7> dro@@ pped <T_3> .
i <T_0> the <T_1> book .
<T_2> &apos;s much <T_1> to use , much less <T_0> .
<T_0> . <T_1> ...
<T_7> i <T_5> , <T_0> resear@@ ching <T_2> other <T_6> that <T_1> could de@@ plo@@ y for stor@@ ing energy -- <T_9> , <T_3> for@@ mu@@ lations of batter@@ ies -- <T_8> just wasn &apos;t prac@@ tical to store <T_4> .

although <T_2> do two-@@ thir@@ ds <T_1> the <T_3> &apos;s labor , <T_4> own less <T_0> one <T_5> of the world &apos;s as@@ sets .

we &apos;ve <T_0> 3@@ 3 <T_1> out this <T_2> .
and imagine <T_0> that by hand .
<T_0> , <T_2> sense <T_4> com@@ ics &apos; vision <T_3> , and <T_1> &apos;s <T_5> .

<T_2> ultimate goal is <T_0> you <T_3> any of <T_1> things from <T_4> .
<T_0> image , for example , <T_1> sort <T_6> spo@@ t-@@ on <T_5> it exactly sums up what el@@ ton <T_4> be doing in <T_9> , <T_7> also what <T_2> be happening with <T_8> hus@@ sein , and george bush <T_3> the koran up@@ si@@ de-@@ down .
<T_0> five is <T_2> good <T_3> , of <T_1> .
to recei@@ ve a <T_8> from the <T_7> , and <T_4> days <T_0> , a <T_2> was <T_1> over <T_3> landscape and <T_5> this <T_6> .
<T_6> hid@@ den dan@@ ger <T_1> he@@ ter@@ oc@@ y@@ cli@@ c <T_3> -- specifically <T_4> , or phi@@ p -- <T_2> is the <T_0> or <T_5> com@@ po@@ und .
and <T_2> now let me <T_0> two <T_1> appro@@ a@@ ches <T_4> changing <T_5> reality of the <T_3> .
<T_1> mac@@ cre@@ ad@@ y : a flight on solar <T_0>
<T_0> save <T_2> percent of the electricity <T_4> an <T_3> that you would have done <T_5> an <T_1> inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent .
the world <T_3> much better <T_9> to over@@ come <T_5> increase in <T_0> price of <T_4> today , <T_2> ever <T_7> the <T_8> , <T_6> of what <T_1> &apos;m talking about .
and i believe that <T_4> you look <T_2> the biggest challenge we <T_9> , it <T_1> to <T_3> people to have the confidence <T_6> we can build <T_8> truly <T_7> society with the institutions that <T_0> fo@@ unded on these <T_5> .
<T_3> listen <T_2> mi@@ mic and <T_0> what they <T_1> .
<T_5> ny@@ u resear@@ cher here <T_3> little car@@ d@@ board robots <T_2> s@@ mi@@ ley <T_9> on them , and <T_8> motor that just <T_7> them forward <T_0> a <T_6> sti@@ cking out the back with <T_1> des@@ i@@ red <T_4> .
so <T_0> began this <T_1> , and <T_3> launched <T_2> in 199@@ 9 .
<T_0> . <T_1> we &apos;re going north , very <T_2> north .
but that <T_8> risk <T_7> , <T_1> all of the other <T_6> are <T_9> managed , <T_2> distribu@@ ted ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables <T_3> into <T_0> micro@@ -@@ gri@@ ds that normally <T_4> , but can stand alone <T_5> need .
<T_3> is a <T_4> problem <T_8> a huge <T_2> to <T_6> because <T_7> means that <T_1> of the most passionate <T_9> in@@ formed <T_0> are completely si@@ len@@ ced , especially <T_5> election time .
<T_1> many people check <T_0> .
all right , <T_2> would <T_0> see this <T_1> ?
<T_7> would have to film <T_3> from a <T_2> long distance <T_0> he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter and <T_1> have a really <T_4> lens , and <T_6> would see ourselves , on <T_5> , <T_8> .
they <T_1> found a <T_0> .
<T_0> stol@@ l : the call to <T_1>
<T_3> first thing <T_0> would see <T_4> a <T_2> amount of <T_1> information .
you can <T_0> the cop@@ per tips <T_1> these things .
<T_8> -- the <T_2> -- <T_7> pretty lucky <T_0> because , by and <T_4> , <T_6> really don &apos;t have to ada@@ pt to our <T_3> ; <T_1> ada@@ pt our <T_5> to <T_9> .
<T_5> i <T_4> we make <T_6> fundamental <T_1> -- <T_0> make an <T_3> , that we think that , <T_7> people need something , <T_2> don &apos;t have to make them <T_8> that .
<T_2> since <T_3> i &apos;ve <T_1> the un@@ folding <T_0> of wor@@ ker rights .
<T_6> their <T_5> , of course , was <T_8> more than <T_9> wanted to stop the <T_1> and put <T_7> tro@@ op@@ s in har@@ m &apos;s way <T_3> do that , nor do we <T_0> want to get in the way <T_2> plu@@ ck genoci@@ da@@ ir@@ es from <T_4> .
<T_2> can <T_0> both of these <T_1> .
so all of a <T_0> we had two <T_1> .
fungi <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> to <T_4> from bacteria , and so our <T_3> antibio@@ tics come from <T_2> .
<T_0> just for <T_3> , but <T_1> your generation <T_4> generations <T_2> come .
<T_0> organi@@ ze <T_1> whole life <T_2> this .
<T_2> &apos;s basically how <T_1> thing <T_0> .
so <T_1> do <T_3> do ? <T_0> , what <T_2> do is to measure .
y@@ ang <T_1> : <T_0> generation that &apos;s <T_2> china
so <T_3> you cross <T_9> bor@@ der -- just across <T_5> bor@@ der -- a <T_1> fac@@ tory <T_8> ger@@ many , and here you can see <T_2> guy <T_4> his computer screen , and those <T_0> in <T_6> are <T_7> .
let &apos;s do something <T_0> simple .
it <T_0> destroy the ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca del@@ ta , <T_4> largest <T_2> possibly greatest fres@@ h@@ water del@@ ta <T_3> the <T_1> .
and i &apos;m going to go through some of <T_0> .
<T_5> i <T_0> this <T_3> image <T_4> say <T_2> is what <T_1> to mo@@ s@@ ses .
so <T_1> said to <T_2> , einstein has been <T_3> to describe gravity in <T_0> of <T_9> and cur@@ ves <T_5> space -- in <T_4> , space and <T_7> , <T_6> be more <T_8> .
<T_8> that was such an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening , trans@@ forma@@ tive moment for <T_3> to think that <T_2> the biggest impact <T_4> &apos;d ever had on anyone &apos;s life , a moment that <T_1> a <T_9> walk up to a stran@@ ger four <T_0> later and say , &quot; <T_5> &apos;ve been an <T_7> important person in my life , &quot; was a moment that <T_6> didn &apos;t even remember .
<T_0> looks at <T_3> like i &apos;m her , you know , her mor@@ on child , <T_2> cre@@ tin , <T_5> one she &apos;s got to speak to <T_4> slowly <T_1> dist@@ in@@ ctly .
<T_2> they <T_1> qu@@ alities <T_0> &apos;d all recognize .
<T_8> has the <T_2> idea . <T_7> think buddha <T_0> so boring , <T_6> they &apos;re so surprised <T_3> they meet <T_5> lam@@ a <T_4> he &apos;s <T_1> j@@ olly .
and think of <T_0> laptop <T_1> a <T_2> .
<T_6> hi@@ pp@@ o ju@@ g@@ ger@@ n@@ aut <T_2> have created , if <T_3> , is <T_8> -- <T_7> to the best <T_4> of on@@ going bio@@ diversity research -- to reduce <T_5> of earth &apos;s still survi@@ ving animal and plant <T_1> to extin@@ ction <T_0> critical en@@ danger@@ ment by the end of the <T_9> .
and <T_0> , <T_7> had <T_6> fly to the <T_5> system <T_2> get any sense that this <T_9> , as <T_4> mo@@ ons , was anything other <T_1> a <T_8> ball of <T_3> .
it <T_4> put in place <T_2> national environmental <T_6> act , <T_5> clean <T_1> act , <T_3> clean <T_0> act .
and <T_4> interesting thing that happens -- because we &apos;re using ta@@ d@@ po@@ les , of course , because they have the <T_7> ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te bio@@ senses <T_6> we have , <T_1> or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tude more sensi@@ tive than some of our senses for <T_0> , respon@@ ding <T_2> a biologi@@ cally meaningful way , to <T_8> whole class <T_3> industrial cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants we call <T_5> dis@@ rup@@ tors or hor@@ m@@ one <T_9> .

if you <T_3> to <T_4> to me about ad@@ h@@ d afterwards , you can talk to me then . all <T_2> -- by the <T_7> , one last instru@@ ction , for my <T_6> with <T_0> cal@@ cul@@ ators -- ok , you know who <T_9> are -- there is at least a <T_5> percent chance <T_1> i will make a <T_8> here .

and <T_3> better , because <T_2> &apos;s an <T_5> app@@ lication , you <T_1> tell <T_4> story for <T_0> .
<T_0> when <T_2> find them they pull <T_3> out <T_1> they p@@ in them <T_4> the wall <T_5> bu@@ tter@@ flies .

and so <T_0> &apos;re <T_3> . this <T_1> preci@@ ous met@@ als and <T_2> .

<T_0> . <T_1> .
<T_1> the <T_0> of <T_2> , you still <T_4> , <T_3> still matter .

thank you .
so <T_1> 2 was <T_2> a three-@@ ac@@ re , <T_6> se@@ aled , <T_3> world that <T_4> lived in for two years <T_5> 20 <T_0> .
ki@@ wis are , and so are <T_1> ha@@ w@@ ks <T_0> near <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> large <T_1> . it &apos;s all <T_0> nasa <T_4> research center .
so , how <T_1> i explain <T_0> myster@@ ious <T_2> ?
and you <T_2> , if <T_3> a <T_0> , what it &apos;s going to be <T_1> inside ?
i was actually <T_1> with the <T_3> with <T_0> of good <T_2> .
<T_0> that &apos;s <T_3> the <T_2> part , or ought <T_1> be .
if <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> , we &apos;re <T_3> course <T_0> top the char@@ ts .
and <T_4> be honest , if i had known when <T_0> was <T_8> to give <T_9> up@@ beat talk that even <T_7> i was giving the up@@ beat <T_2> , the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se would be <T_3> -- -- i <T_6> have said , &quot; is it <T_1> if i talk about <T_5> else ? &quot;
so exploration <T_0> pay for <T_1> .
this <T_0> &apos;t story <T_2> ; it &apos;s <T_1> ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
<T_1> there was <T_0> looking back at all <T_2> us .
<T_2> thought <T_0> was fit@@ ting for me <T_1> be doing that .
so <T_0> yourself .
<T_2> president needs to stand up and say , at the <T_1> of a healthcare reform debate , &quot; our goal as a country <T_7> to move <T_9> percent <T_6> care <T_5> of <T_0> , clinics , <T_8> and <T_4> homes , to the home , in 10 <T_3> . &quot;
so <T_5> basically <T_3> out <T_2> ht@@ m@@ l <T_8> look like : hyper@@ text proto@@ co@@ l , <T_6> ; the <T_1> of ur@@ ls , <T_7> names <T_0> things which started <T_4> h@@ ttp .

<T_2> has <T_0> ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated <T_1> ?
so <T_4> &apos;ll have <T_2> use our computers <T_3> try to <T_1> the <T_0> .

this <T_7> not unusual , <T_4> it &apos;s part <T_6> what en@@ ables people to <T_1> these <T_9> of <T_3> , because <T_0> makes such a big <T_2> in <T_5> quality <T_8> life .

<T_3> &apos;m actually going to give you <T_1> example <T_0> how <T_2> do so .
and <T_1> can see them <T_0> throughout .

okay , so we &apos;re <T_0> in these sorts of <T_1> .
notice both <T_0> of that <T_1> .
the first <T_7> is that it <T_6> out <T_5> pleas@@ ant <T_4> , your <T_0> of positive <T_8> , is <T_9> , <T_3> 50 percent <T_2> , and , in fact , <T_1> very modi@@ fi@@ able .
<T_0> think <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> of the most incredible men <T_1> relation to <T_2> politics -- <T_6> afghanistan , in <T_4> .
he would <T_4> into <T_3> businesses <T_5> close down 30 <T_2> of the <T_1> , just <T_6> american <T_0> into g@@ ho@@ st to@@ w@@ ns .
it &apos;s still going on .
by dete@@ cting <T_1> od@@ or of particular <T_0> , or viruses , <T_3> even lung <T_4> , the <T_2> will <T_8> and <T_7> can <T_6> software to <T_5> the results .
<T_4> , these <T_1> countries have <T_0> identical g@@ in@@ i co@@ efficient , which <T_3> a measure of <T_2> equality .
god knows <T_1> took <T_2> huge amount <T_0> technical sk@@ ill .
i like them <T_3> , <T_2> , <T_1> , slightly <T_0> off .
<T_5> on <T_2> other <T_4> of that <T_0> is a female hus@@ ky in <T_1> play bo@@ w , wa@@ g@@ ging her <T_3> .

another <T_1> an hour <T_2> we <T_0> have won . &quot;
and i <T_2> she <T_0> &apos;t want me to go get them , so i just <T_3> it <T_1> .
but <T_6> wrote a <T_4> about this , and <T_1> in the <T_0> world <T_8> using electricity <T_3> con@@ vul@@ se <T_9> who <T_2> either <T_5> or <T_7> depres@@ sed .
<T_1> , <T_0> copy@@ right protection .
mach@@ u <T_0> was never <T_1> lost <T_2> .
so <T_1> calculate the <T_0> redu@@ ction per <T_3> , <T_4> it &apos;s <T_2> of the same <T_5> .
bar@@ ry <T_0> : our <T_1> of <T_2>

<T_0> we see that ? <T_2> : <T_1> .
the <T_1> bat@@ s@@ man <T_0> to <T_2> the fiel@@ der .
well , soon <T_6> black <T_1> formed over <T_7> head <T_2> here i <T_0> , <T_5> very <T_4> , but <T_3> very depres@@ sed .
<T_6> picture <T_4> me <T_7> sna@@ pped by the cop@@ il@@ ot <T_2> our ch@@ ase air@@ craft just moments <T_0> the <T_5> got off the ground <T_1> the first <T_3> .
and <T_1> these days <T_0> try <T_3> learn from <T_2> grand@@ father &apos;s example <T_4> my <T_5> way .
<T_0> this <T_1> a typical <T_2> .
<T_0> all patients are <T_1> . &quot;

<T_1> the first <T_2> is called &quot; <T_0> fau@@ l@@ ty <T_3> . &quot;
so <T_0> absor@@ b <T_9> statistics <T_7> the <T_6> and it changes <T_1> brains ; it changes them <T_4> the <T_5> of the world <T_3> the cultu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und <T_8> that we <T_2> .
and i <T_2> the united states -- we still want to see <T_1> background -- i put them up like this , and now we <T_0> back@@ wards .
i negoti@@ ated <T_9> my country <T_3> resol@@ ution in <T_7> security coun@@ cil of the 12@@ th of september 2001 <T_5> the <T_4> of the <T_1> before , <T_0> were , of course , deeply present to <T_6> actually living in new <T_2> at the <T_8> .
too <T_4> time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like <T_5> &apos;s so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago <T_8> thought that the <T_7> un@@ boring <T_9> in the <T_0> would be like a t@@ .@@ v@@ . <T_3> , <T_2> for <T_6> day show . some <T_1> of day talk show .
so <T_2> turns <T_0> that google is <T_3> com@@ passionate company , <T_4> googl@@ ers <T_1> compassion to be <T_5> .
<T_0> had the <T_7> . <T_5> the <T_3> one , but <T_8> was one that i used <T_1> that particular <T_6> , <T_4> i think he made the <T_2> to become the best &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
then <T_6> present all of the stuff that <T_2> &apos;ve developed to <T_3> team@@ mates , to the <T_1> of the company , <T_0> this <T_5> and <T_4> all@@ -@@ hands meeting <T_7> the end of the <T_8> .
<T_2> what , <T_0> anything , <T_3> men have to <T_1> with it ?
now , in my lab <T_3> stanford , we &apos;ve been working <T_2> autonom@@ ous cars too , but with a <T_7> different <T_6> on things . you see , <T_5> &apos;ve been developing robotic <T_8> cars , cars that <T_4> actually push themselves <T_1> the very <T_9> of <T_0> performance .
<T_4> the <T_1> exi@@ sted before the ban@@ g , and the <T_2> was <T_5> a <T_3> event <T_0> a pre@@ -@@ exi@@ sting universe .
<T_0> is an easy <T_1> .
it &apos;s just , you know , it was just so <T_3> , <T_0> to <T_4> -- this <T_1> her <T_2> in the <T_5> there .
we &apos;re <T_3> going to <T_4> , even <T_2> the <T_1> world , going to have to <T_5> everything <T_6> we <T_0> .

well , what <T_0> this really <T_1> like ?
<T_6> we won &apos;t be able to take care of <T_3> of those <T_0> if <T_4> don &apos;t solve <T_5> real <T_1> we have <T_2> mexico first .

<T_7> happens is , if something <T_1> happens , <T_8> something <T_0> happens to you , you &apos;re able to produce <T_4> this beautiful stuff inst@@ antly , and <T_3> that &apos;s what i consider &quot; <T_9> , &quot; because <T_2> &apos;s when everything <T_5> and you &apos;re able to do <T_6> .

<T_1> , si@@ ber@@ ia , <T_0> .

maybe many of you have <T_8> this with loved ones , you can <T_1> somebody <T_4> can &apos;t recognize their face in the <T_5> , or can &apos;t tell anyone in their family , but <T_9> can still find a <T_2> of music that <T_3> person will jump out of the <T_0> and start singing . <T_6> with that you can bring back parts of people &apos;s memories <T_7> person@@ alities .
we <T_1> identifi@@ ed over 400 <T_2> of be@@ es in <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> on fra@@ ppe@@ d-@@ out <T_0> .
and <T_1> want to start by telling you <T_2> story <T_3> that <T_0> in <T_4> .
<T_5> that <T_3> fe@@ ature <T_2> down to <T_0> 20 nan@@ ome@@ ters , and <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> complex 3d structure .
dou@@ g <T_4> won@@ ders , <T_5> , maybe our intelligence <T_8> isn &apos;t great <T_1> to <T_0> our <T_6> , and if <T_2> were smar@@ ter , well , <T_9> our brains would be that much more <T_7> , <T_3> we &apos;d never catch up to it .
there &apos;s <T_0> compar@@ ison at all .
<T_1> first drug for <T_2> / <T_3> was not <T_0> for <T_4> / aids .
and <T_3> learn , of course , many , many <T_6> , but many of <T_0> are <T_2> . and one of <T_5> , of course , is <T_4> -- that we <T_7> a <T_1> to the natural world that &apos;s very profound .
and she didn &apos;t see <T_0> for years .
<T_0> then that was <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;re <T_1> class b <T_3> , life@@ time <T_0> offen@@ der .
<T_3> , because <T_0> know , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
we <T_0> born into a <T_2> of time <T_1> space .
<T_0> then you <T_3> these things and <T_2> &apos;re <T_1> or un@@ happy .
<T_5> imagine <T_0> we could create the <T_6> &apos;s <T_3> r@@ ating system <T_1> which we <T_7> score fo@@ ods <T_2> to <T_8> anti@@ angiogen@@ ic , can@@ cer@@ -@@ prev@@ ent@@ ative <T_4> .
<T_2> believe a <T_0> there has to be <T_1> .
now let &apos;s <T_0> that <T_3> were an econom@@ ist in 192@@ 9 , trying to for@@ ec@@ ast future growth for the united <T_2> , <T_8> knowing <T_6> the economy was about <T_9> go off a cli@@ ff , not knowing <T_5> we were about to <T_7> the greatest <T_4> dis@@ aster certainly in <T_1> 20th century .
so , you <T_0> see <T_1> mat@@ ched <T_2> perfectly , perfectly .
and <T_3> way <T_2> you saw , sort of , <T_6> sort <T_7> , this <T_4> towards the <T_0> is through <T_5> like <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;m sure <T_0> people here <T_1> heard about <T_2> .
we <T_7> medi@@ tat@@ ors , who have <T_8> doing that for <T_6> and <T_4> , to put their <T_0> in <T_2> state <T_5> there &apos;s nothing but lo@@ ving kin@@ dness <T_9> total avail@@ ability <T_3> sen@@ ti@@ ent <T_1> .
but if <T_4> were fre@@ ely <T_2> through the <T_6> , <T_3> without this <T_0> grid , <T_8> might be able to paint it <T_1> , because we would notice <T_9> we traveled along straight lines , un@@ de@@ fle@@ cted straight <T_5> through the <T_7> .
so <T_3> said , &quot; well , perhaps we <T_4> constru@@ ct <T_5> bio@@ sig@@ nature <T_2> on <T_0> as a <T_1> process .
<T_0> big idea , i think , is more <T_1> .
<T_0> a little , but <T_1> &apos;s building .
we <T_0> nuclear mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ al genes . it &apos;s there .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , <T_3> pro@@ c@@ ed@@ ure <T_0> &apos;t changed <T_1> about <T_2> years .
when you <T_5> at the theater , <T_1> disco@@ ver <T_2> somewhere <T_3> the <T_4> you &apos;ve lost the <T_0> .
you <T_2> know that <T_1> has <T_0> .
<T_2> exam@@ ination <T_1> that <T_4> temperature changes <T_0> lead the co2 changes <T_3> a few <T_5> .
<T_2> : production is too <T_1> . <T_3> : price <T_4> too <T_0> .
now , when you want to use the <T_6> in@@ do@@ ors , all you have <T_8> do is pull the le@@ vers out of the dri@@ v@@ et@@ rain , sto@@ w them in the fra@@ me , and it conver@@ ts into a normal <T_0> that you can use just like any <T_2> normal wheelchair , and we si@@ zed it like a normal wheelchair , so it &apos;s nar@@ row enough to fit <T_5> a standard <T_7> , it &apos;s low enough to fit under a <T_9> , and it &apos;s small and man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able enough to fit in a ba@@ th@@ room and this is important so the us@@ er can get up close to a toi@@ let , and be able to <T_1> off just <T_4> he could in <T_3> normal wheelchair .
<T_2> the eye <T_0> , then there &apos;s always <T_1> happening .
<T_4> doesn &apos;t work <T_0> a universe <T_5> four <T_1> of space , nor <T_2> , <T_3> six .
and <T_4> believe we <T_5> to streng@@ then this <T_1> in <T_6> diplo@@ macy , <T_0> only <T_2> states , but <T_3> within states .
a lot of he@@ ck@@ ling <T_4> the <T_3> of trying <T_2> make sure <T_0> the com@@ edi@@ an is going <T_6> be able to <T_5> , and over@@ come <T_1> he@@ ck@@ ler .
health <T_0> poor .
<T_2> tried to make <T_1> more <T_0> .
so <T_0> does <T_1> transition begin ?
<T_0> let &apos;s <T_5> , let &apos;s deal with those <T_3> you who <T_1> trying to <T_4> your <T_2> .
and look <T_3> all the complex things <T_4> wonderful things we &apos;ve been able to create <T_0> just a one <T_1> a <T_2> .
and <T_4> decided <T_0> had to get <T_1> than <T_2> drawing fan@@ tas@@ y <T_3> .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t fly trans@@ -@@ atlantic business class often enough <T_5> know , or any other kind of <T_0> class really , but <T_1> assu@@ me that <T_8> business class , you don &apos;t hear many expres@@ sions of , you know , bi@@ got@@ ry about ra@@ cial groups or eth@@ ni@@ c groups , <T_9> the people who are flying trans@@ -@@ atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , cap@@ ital@@ ism has been a constru@@ ctive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum@@ ness that has been a constru@@ ctive <T_4> in exp@@ and@@ ing people &apos;s real@@ m <T_6> moral awareness . i think the non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic , which is not only economic by any means -- it &apos;s not <T_3> commer@@ ce -- <T_7> it has dri@@ ven us to the ver@@ ge of a moral truth , which <T_2> the fundamental equality of everyone . it has done that .

and by the way , <T_9> i take <T_0> at old <T_3> , i want to as@@ sure everybody , and particularly the <T_6> industry -- <T_5> &apos;s been <T_7> suppor@@ tive of <T_2> -- that i don &apos;t think this <T_1> any way <T_4> with air@@ planes , <T_8> cars .
<T_0> why are <T_1> not eating insects <T_2> ?
i <T_0> animals , <T_4> i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just <T_3> to <T_7> their production <T_5> to <T_1> them out <T_6> they were <T_2> .
<T_0> certainly is .
sometimes , you <T_2> , it <T_4> as late <T_0> may , <T_1> summer <T_3> comes eventually . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;m going to see how <T_2> of <T_5> at the back of <T_1> room can actually get <T_4> things <T_3> the <T_6> .
<T_1> think <T_3> &apos;s people &apos;s curi@@ osity <T_0> motiv@@ ates <T_2> to come into <T_4> projects .
<T_3> of the <T_5> of the <T_0> . <T_7> &apos;s a really important thing <T_4> the web <T_2> you to put <T_1> kinds <T_6> data up there .
and <T_0> saw from a young age <T_4> having a de@@ cent job <T_1> ear@@ ning a good <T_5> made the <T_3> difference <T_2> families who were <T_6> .
and after a few <T_7> , <T_0> therap@@ ist tries a new <T_2> , <T_6> they start singing <T_1> , and gab@@ by starts <T_9> sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she s@@ ings , in <T_4> des@@ cen@@ ding scale , <T_3> s@@ ings , &quot; let <T_8> shine , let it shine , let <T_5> shine . &quot;
so <T_0> re@@ treated back <T_4> my ca@@ ve <T_2> continued to support <T_6> produce <T_8> and <T_3> my <T_7> use my cou@@ ch <T_5> a regi@@ onal <T_1> hu@@ b .
jack of spa@@ des .
for example , there &apos;s particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is <T_4> respect <T_1> the el@@ derly in east <T_7> , associated <T_5> con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us &apos; do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine <T_2> fi@@ li@@ al <T_3> , <T_0> means <T_9> , respect <T_8> support for <T_6> parents .
so the question <T_5> , why did <T_1> men <T_0> so much more <T_4> the extreme <T_2> of star@@ vation <T_3>
and i think re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of <T_4> the position <T_2> about <T_9> this <T_8> piece of <T_0> is to <T_1> used , having it come out of actually <T_6> it in <T_3> real en@@ coun@@ ter , i think makes it <T_5> more powerful <T_7> .
<T_2> could <T_0> future of animal products <T_1> like ?
the <T_1> cost of this <T_0> is <T_2> .
in fact , of <T_1> 20,000 , 8@@ ,000 were thought to be <T_0> .
and <T_3> i grew up , <T_0> heard so <T_1> knowledge <T_8> so <T_4> insi@@ ghts <T_9> so <T_5> wisdom come out <T_6> this table , i began to call <T_2> the wisdom <T_7> .
<T_6> looking <T_0> this <T_4> will <T_5> this dol@@ ph@@ in <T_2> surro@@ unded , and <T_1> his <T_3> is being dis@@ rup@@ ted .
think how much <T_4> and how many <T_2> it took <T_3> to <T_1> satelli@@ tes <T_0> space .
now <T_1> tell you <T_6> -- i tell you <T_0> at the <T_3> of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing myself , because <T_5> think part of the <T_2> of <T_7> is to ad@@ mit <T_9> aes@@ the@@ tics , that <T_8> , that <T_4> do matter .
<T_7> in addition , if you compare the sk@@ ul@@ l with <T_5> compar@@ ably <T_3> chimpanze@@ e <T_2> little <T_6> bush <T_4> , you <T_1> that you have <T_0> fore@@ head .

<T_1> : <T_3> get chil@@ ls <T_2> time <T_0> see that .
we <T_4> a <T_0> for that , <T_6> we are <T_8> of it , <T_2> generally we <T_5> pay the price <T_3> increas@@ ed <T_7> , <T_1> and opportunities .
a <T_2> of <T_1> fle@@ w out of <T_0> mou@@ ths of <T_3> who <T_4> world didn &apos;t think were interested .
<T_0> this man <T_2> cros@@ s-@@ leg@@ ged is <T_1> a grow@@ n-@@ up <T_4> , a <T_3> who i &apos;ve known since <T_5> .

<T_3> of do@@ ct@@ or@@ -@@ patient <T_2> , <T_4> couldn &apos;t <T_1> tell us <T_0> was going on .

<T_1> the <T_2> &quot; <T_0> &quot; sc@@ are you ?
but <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> absolute <T_3> when it comes to <T_0> .
<T_1> we already see <T_2> of <T_0> going on here .
you &apos;ve <T_0> seen lots of artic@@ les <T_1> climate change , and <T_7> &apos;s yet <T_8> new <T_6> times <T_4> , just <T_2> every other <T_3> one you &apos;ve <T_5> .
this <T_1> the <T_2> in me getting lucky <T_0> .
<T_0> you are seeing , now , that <T_2> being trans@@ posed on to ben <T_1> .
and at <T_1> risk of <T_2> gran@@ di@@ ose , it <T_0> the <T_3> &apos;s loss .
an analysis of this res@@ pi@@ ro@@ cy@@ te , designed <T_3> ro@@ b frei@@ t@@ as , indi@@ c@@ ates if <T_4> re@@ place 10 percent <T_2> your red blood cells with <T_6> robotic <T_7> , you could do <T_8> olymp@@ ic <T_0> for <T_5> minutes <T_1> taking a bre@@ ath .

<T_2> only the <T_0> , he &apos;d taken <T_1> temple ves@@ sel@@ s .
<T_0> this <T_4> a very , <T_2> dangerous thing <T_1> do around di@@ ck <T_3> .
<T_1> was <T_0> .
so what &apos;s actually happening <T_0> that <T_2> networks <T_1> re@@ al-@@ time technologies are taking <T_3> back .
there were <T_1> 18 and <T_0> people <T_2> all together .
<T_7> it &apos;s no <T_9> that <T_1> a 2007 pe@@ w sur@@ v@@ ey , <T_4> sur@@ ve@@ yed , afri@@ cans in <T_3> countries <T_0> they thought that the chinese were <T_2> amazing things to improve <T_6> li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods by <T_5> marg@@ ins , by as much as <T_8> percent .
he <T_0> help getting <T_1> million <T_2> .
<T_2> one below <T_3> to fire <T_4> there &apos;s a wall <T_1> by to the <T_0> .
<T_1> want to be a <T_0> to <T_2> them . &quot;
of <T_2> it hel@@ ps <T_4> fear of <T_0> failure <T_1> as <T_5> number of <T_3> which have fail@@ ed incre@@ ases .
not <T_2> computer <T_3> . it &apos;s <T_0> at all like computer <T_1> .
<T_7> can <T_6> this using a <T_0> of <T_2> dynam@@ ics to explain <T_3> patterns that <T_4> see all around <T_1> conflicts around <T_5> world .
<T_0> so <T_1> went on .
and so <T_6> my other <T_0> collabor@@ ator , <T_5> cu@@ t@@ ko@@ sky , <T_7> stanford -- he <T_2> much larger <T_8> than <T_1> geck@@ o , <T_3> used the same general <T_4> .

<T_2> have <T_0> idea <T_3> much time <T_1> spend .
there <T_9> a <T_8> inter@@ n at <T_1> canada called h@@ unter <T_4> , <T_6> was working in impro@@ v in tor@@ onto , and got <T_7> part@@ -@@ time job <T_3> advertising , <T_2> was given the <T_5> of advertising <T_0> .
because , actually , i &apos;m <T_0> sop@@ hom@@ ore <T_1> college right now .
freedom <T_2> experiment <T_1> freedom to experiment with <T_0> .
you &apos;re going to get <T_2> eventually . <T_0> have faith in <T_1> .
the good <T_1> about this <T_7> that <T_5> global <T_0> -- again , <T_2> brazi@@ lian <T_3> tell me -- <T_6> pit@@ ching in <T_4> help out .
<T_4> you , <T_1> bl@@ ess <T_2> and <T_0> the day . i &apos;m <T_3> ri@@ tz .
<T_1> wind@@ shi@@ eld co@@ ating <T_0> going to give you about <T_2> degre@@ es .
<T_1> is <T_0> approach ?
<T_3> bad news , however , to <T_0> question of will <T_2> pre@@ va@@ il , is <T_1> evil <T_4> on .
<T_2> shouldn &apos;t <T_3> just check <T_6> that the <T_0> system that we <T_5> is <T_4> capable of deli@@ vering this kind of <T_1> ?
we &apos;re going <T_7> simu@@ late <T_3> ga@@ it of <T_6> particular child <T_1> the <T_4> can then work <T_8> that simulation <T_0> try out different ways to improve that <T_2> , <T_9> he actually com@@ mit@@ s to <T_5> actual surgery .
no one .
<T_0> is <T_1> information to have , <T_3> it &apos;s <T_2> that complicated .
these <T_5> dots , these <T_1> areas , basically <T_0> the food <T_3> li@@ ve@@ lihood <T_6> more <T_2> half a billion <T_4> .
what you can <T_0> up here is <T_5> map <T_3> the world , and we &apos;re <T_1> the <T_2> of this <T_4> mi@@ te .
<T_2> &apos;m going to let <T_0> in on that <T_1> .
everybody <T_0> consi@@ ders <T_1> a cre@@ ator , and <T_2> just <T_3> vie@@ wer .
there <T_3> a ten@@ den@@ cy <T_4> think that <T_1> we engage too directly with moral questions in <T_5> , <T_2> &apos;s a <T_7> for dis@@ agre@@ ement , and for that matter , a reci@@ pe <T_6> in@@ toler@@ ance and <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s hard <T_1> do high-@@ rise .
<T_1> &apos;s highly <T_0> .
<T_0> cop@@ per <T_1> m@@ old .
what i &apos;d like to do with <T_4> rest of my <T_0> with you today is <T_2> a little bit <T_1> one of the <T_3> that we &apos;ve been investig@@ ating , and <T_5> &apos;s mind-wandering .
what we <T_2> out , when you <T_0> from molecules <T_1> electr@@ ons , <T_4> interesting <T_3> .
<T_4> expan@@ sion to <T_7> land , for <T_8> last <T_2> years -- you <T_9> the <T_0> land out on <T_3> edge -- has <T_1> generations of families <T_5> the american <T_6> .
if we <T_8> to that the <T_5> of us here now who <T_1> more productive because they have <T_9> pair of <T_4> , <T_0> almost one in <T_7> indi@@ ans will <T_6> eye care , a <T_3> 200 million <T_2> .
<T_5> you sit down and <T_1> a meal with <T_7> kids , whether <T_8> take your <T_9> , <T_0> grand@@ children , or <T_6> and <T_4> shop@@ ping <T_3> a farmers &apos; market . just <T_2> ta@@ st@@ ings with them .
so <T_3> was like , &quot; maybe you <T_0> to ask <T_2> of my <T_1> that directly . &quot;
this <T_0> the mo@@ dus <T_1> that we have today .
country 1 has <T_0> syste@@ matic <T_3> over <T_2> 2 <T_1> infra@@ structures .
<T_1> is <T_2> current state of the <T_0> &apos;s phosphor@@ us reser@@ ves ?
they <T_2> them up <T_0> two <T_1> .
but <T_3> was one <T_1> an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that <T_0> found in <T_2> .
in one case , the <T_8> are told , &quot; but you know , if you want to change <T_5> mind , i &apos;ll always have the other one here , and <T_3> the <T_7> four days , before i actually mail it to <T_1> , i &apos;ll <T_4> gla@@ d to &quot; -- -- yeah , &quot; head@@ quar@@ ters &quot; -- &quot; <T_9> &apos;ll be gla@@ d to s@@ wa@@ p it out with you . in fact , i &apos;ll come <T_6> your dor@@ m room and give -- just give me <T_0> email . <T_2> yet , i &apos;ll check with you .
<T_2> have <T_3> running through <T_0> , controll@@ ing <T_1> it &apos;s going .
&quot; <T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> sha@@ de of <T_2> . &quot;
someone &apos;s <T_0> a <T_2> through <T_1> window .
but <T_4> experiment is <T_5> the <T_3> of the <T_1> , because <T_2> still have to trans@@ mit that <T_0> to <T_6> people .
like , we <T_3> to design <T_6> which <T_2> as a <T_0> object , but <T_4> break down into small <T_1> and have an <T_8> of both <T_5> big <T_9> and <T_7> small scale .
<T_3> it &apos;s <T_4> cost of driving <T_2> &apos;s making <T_5> want to <T_0> to do <T_1> .
to further <T_2> their <T_3> , they actually have <T_0> p@@ .@@ r. fir@@ ms that shape <T_5> the <T_4> talks about <T_1> .
so <T_0> we <T_5> you <T_3> the <T_4> of you &apos;ve got <T_2> , we can <T_1> you pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin .
and <T_2> , that evolution <T_0> the <T_4> that <T_1> evolution had <T_3> toward <T_5> comple@@ xity .
and the <T_0> will tell <T_2> when to <T_3> the <T_1> .
<T_1> : <T_2> . it &apos;s just <T_0> .
this is the piece <T_1> i <T_0> you about .
what <T_0> origami ?
<T_3> they <T_0> -- and you don &apos;t want to know <T_7> happens if <T_8> don &apos;t -- <T_5> train them and they <T_6> them <T_4> how to run the most efficient cri@@ min@@ al operation <T_2> that <T_1> , in exchange for <T_9> .
don &apos;t <T_0> ; nobody will think <T_1> &apos;re honest .
<T_8> these <T_3> , what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve comp@@ lied all the <T_2> , <T_4> the available recor@@ ds of <T_6> birds , put <T_1> together , and <T_7> out they migra@@ te at <T_0> the same <T_9> as <T_5> dra@@ gon@@ flies .
<T_4> pin@@ ker &apos;s book the <T_3> s@@ late argu@@ es <T_0> all humans are born <T_8> some in@@ na@@ te <T_9> . here , <T_6> talks about his <T_5> , <T_2> why <T_1> people found <T_7> incredibly up@@ setting .
<T_5> &apos;s a <T_2> association ; it rais@@ ed <T_7> 20 <T_6> dollars to <T_1> the engineering <T_3> just get this <T_4> , <T_8> then have it <T_0> afterwards .
well <T_3> a real <T_2> , <T_0> can &apos;t <T_4> that ; you &apos;ll get <T_1> down .
they <T_1> in <T_4> man@@ hole <T_0> this . literally , <T_2> is where the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ mile c@@ able <T_3> in .
<T_1> in <T_4> physical world if <T_6> followed our children <T_5> with a <T_0> and a <T_3> and <T_7> their every <T_2> .
and <T_0> is the <T_1> of my <T_2> : sing campaign .
the <T_1> were afraid their jobs were going <T_0> disappe@@ ar .
people <T_1> this <T_0> so <T_2> .
<T_1> ni@@ co@@ le@@ li@@ s : <T_0> monkey that <T_4> a <T_2> with its <T_3> . no , really .
this <T_0> is <T_2> years <T_1> .
so <T_1> you <T_3> about it , <T_0> are really <T_2> impro@@ ving .
well , she <T_1> that <T_2> she , at that time , had <T_0> a <T_3> arm .
<T_3> &apos;m not <T_2> attra@@ cted to her , <T_1> through her life <T_0> , i &apos;m attra@@ cted to her .

<T_1> you see <T_0> there ?

so <T_2> van@@ tage point <T_3> take determin@@ es <T_0> everything <T_4> you will <T_1> .
now <T_1> you separate <T_6> the two , you could actually <T_0> the need <T_2> a convenient <T_3> by creating <T_4> network , by <T_7> a network <T_8> the <T_5> show up .

some people <T_1> say <T_2> &apos;s for <T_0> security .
now , how do <T_0> de@@ du@@ ce <T_2> the galaxy <T_1> ?
this <T_4> con@@ flu@@ ent <T_1> , <T_8> which <T_5> isn &apos;t a <T_0> place on <T_7> body where you could put <T_6> finger and <T_3> be <T_2> by <T_9> .
<T_2> is <T_1> africa that is <T_0> , <T_4> chris <T_3> to .

well <T_4> has <T_0> simple dna structure <T_1> you <T_5> go in and cut and <T_2> addi@@ tional dna <T_3> into it .
and <T_0> make his <T_1> book he used <T_2> .
<T_6> a <T_2> that is <T_5> by a custom@@ er <T_3> used by a <T_4> , and use <T_0> what creates <T_1> .
when i <T_6> to yale , we had <T_5> first energy crisis , and i was designing the <T_3> sol@@ ar-@@ he@@ ated house <T_8> ireland <T_0> a student , <T_7> i <T_9> built -- <T_1> would give <T_4> a sense of <T_2> ambi@@ tion .
and <T_0> think <T_1> message of this is very <T_2> .
<T_1> all <T_0> sense , with <T_3> percent of the <T_2> living there .
i &apos;ve been working on <T_2> of <T_8> for <T_3> than <T_4> years , and <T_6> it &apos;s ir@@ on@@ ic <T_1> the problem that and <T_5> that <T_7> most gra@@ pp@@ le with is how you actually <T_9> poverty . what does <T_0> mean ?
<T_5> only <T_0> that &apos;s different <T_6> the <T_3> that the <T_1> do@@ or@@ -@@ ow@@ ner here put <T_4> the piece -- <T_7> , <T_8> , which <T_2> the psycho@@ -@@ kil@@ ler here ?
<T_9> really have used <T_3> for <T_6> own personal growth and my own <T_5> refle@@ ction on <T_2> strategy and <T_0> and <T_4> man@@ a@@ gement , and just all <T_1> those <T_7> fac@@ ets of the <T_8> .

and then once that <T_2> was on <T_7> , they <T_0> to <T_9> to <T_8> it to the other <T_6> , <T_4> the <T_5> that had been brought down <T_3> the land@@ ing <T_1> .
<T_0> will it <T_1> ?
car@@ ol@@ ine <T_8> plays the cell@@ o <T_6> a sor@@ cer@@ ess ca@@ sting a sp@@ ell , occasi@@ on@@ ally <T_3> behind <T_1> wild man@@ e of bl@@ on@@ d hair as she s@@ ings <T_7> pa@@ stor@@ al the@@ mes . <T_0> per@@ forms &quot; <T_9> than the sun , &quot; <T_2> by <T_4> dol@@ by on <T_5> .
let &apos;s look to <T_0> plays <T_3> shakespe@@ are , <T_2> di@@ alo@@ gu@@ es of <T_1> , the <T_4> of <T_5> au@@ sten .
people are <T_0> to figure this <T_1> .
so i think <T_1> who <T_5> sen@@ sation <T_2> memory <T_0> reali@@ zing <T_3> you &apos;re la@@ ying down memories <T_4> childhood .
<T_2> bet , <T_0> a <T_4> of years , that <T_1> like &quot; co@@ working &quot; and &quot; cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing &quot; and &quot; time ban@@ ks &quot; are going to become a <T_3> of everyday <T_5> .
<T_1> ! they &apos;re not for <T_0> .
so <T_0> did .
<T_1> in a <T_0> years , you &apos;ll check into <T_2> mirror and it &apos;s going to be diagno@@ sing you .
it has <T_0> that dra@@ ws me <T_1> .
it <T_0> yours to <T_1> .
<T_0> whole thing <T_3> two days out of <T_1> se@@ ven@@ -@@ day <T_2> .
and in <T_4> particular example we have here , <T_3> &apos;s a <T_7> , &quot; twi@@ sted <T_8> , &quot; <T_5> the first <T_6> says , &quot; now this <T_1> sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly <T_9> film . it fa@@ ils <T_0> google test <T_2> . &quot;
<T_1> it &apos;s not <T_0> .
and he hand@@ -@@ sele@@ cted <T_0> team <T_3> local <T_4> people to work <T_1> this <T_2> .
<T_1> finally , well , there are <T_2> who <T_3> that corruption <T_0> un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
<T_4> if we had <T_1> african television <T_2> that bro@@ ad@@ cast <T_0> african stories all <T_3> the <T_5> ?
there <T_1> millions of <T_0> with <T_2> all <T_3> us .
<T_1> had <T_5> best ph@@ .@@ d@@ . students , our most <T_7> equi@@ p@@ ment around <T_6> world , we got <T_4> / 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ th <T_2> the project <T_8> , <T_0> how &apos;re we going to get <T_9> done in <T_3> years ?
and <T_2> &apos;m going to <T_4> you <T_1> beautiful possibility <T_3> the <T_0> of this talk .
in <T_4> one , the cre@@ ator told <T_0> narra@@ tive <T_3> how she <T_1> googl@@ ed <T_2> find out <T_5> mother &apos;s day was happening .
and of <T_1> , there &apos;s <T_0> app for that .
<T_0> &apos;s the <T_1> , right ?
it &apos;s <T_2> by <T_1> , <T_0> .
<T_2> not <T_1> they &apos;re together <T_0> that .
<T_0> top <T_1> up to 37 .
<T_1> of this , <T_4> three <T_2> and <T_3> families had to <T_0> their home .
<T_4> &apos;m going to tell you about <T_9> i became a sculp@@ tor , and you <T_1> think that <T_0> , well , they deal <T_6> met@@ a , they deal with objects , they deal with bodies , but i think , really , what <T_8> care about most <T_3> making <T_2> , <T_7> that &apos;s what i &apos;ve called <T_5> talk : making space .
<T_7> dra@@ ke &apos;s <T_9> here became very popular <T_0> it was very <T_1> — and <T_2> &apos;ll get back to that <T_3> and <T_5> the basis of this <T_6> , which didn &apos;t succeed , we <T_4> been doing se@@ ti ever since , <T_8> continu@@ ously , but ever since .
<T_2> reason <T_1> &apos;ve taken this time <T_4> i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated <T_3> hear some of <T_0> re@@ actions to this .
now <T_2> , <T_1> can <T_0> earth &apos;s energy im@@ balance precisely by <T_3> the he@@ at <T_4> in earth &apos;s he@@ at reser@@ vo@@ irs .
it <T_0> easier to <T_2> can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , her@@ o@@ in <T_3> co@@ ca@@ ine , faster <T_1> , in the pris@@ on <T_4> outside the pris@@ on .
what you &apos;re going to <T_0> -- we &apos;re going to have to jump in here <T_3> quickly between <T_4> or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tude to get <T_2> to where we <T_7> the solar system -- these are <T_5> pa@@ ths of <T_9> 1 , vo@@ y@@ ager 2 , <T_6> 11 <T_8> pione@@ er 10 , the first <T_1> space@@ craft to have left the solar system .
so where do we <T_1> from <T_0> ?
<T_1> &apos;ll talk <T_0> you later .
<T_3> in <T_0> lot of <T_2> cases , <T_1> of course are .
<T_4> what &apos;s interesting <T_1> the incredible <T_2> information that <T_0> can get from just <T_3> sens@@ or like this .
<T_2> &apos;d like to start <T_1> a couple of quick <T_0> .
the <T_1> gras@@ s@@ lands <T_2> pat@@ ag@@ on@@ ia are <T_0> to desert as you <T_3> .
<T_2> you <T_0> to succeed , you <T_1> have , right here .
i mean , real <T_1> put <T_0> bits of sol@@ der in .
thank <T_0> .
let me go <T_1> to <T_0> for a second .
and he was <T_0> , <T_1> , in <T_2> he could do <T_4> those <T_3> objects .

<T_4> not only <T_0> you <T_3> twi@@ t@@ ters in different <T_5> , <T_1> it introdu@@ ces new use <T_2> as well .
now if <T_9> look at the cost <T_2> op@@ e@@ c , it <T_0> seven trillion <T_6> -- on the <T_8> institute study last <T_4> -- seven trillion dollars since <T_5> , <T_1> what we <T_3> for <T_7> from op@@ e@@ c .

so in <T_7> reg@@ ard , this is <T_8> of the things , this is <T_6> of the privile@@ ges of being , and here &apos;s another role , the <T_9> , and by the way , when i told you <T_4> i &apos;m <T_5> world &apos;s greatest , if you &apos;re keeping <T_2> , we &apos;ve had nar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism <T_1> soli@@ p@@ s@@ ism and now <T_0> healthy dose of <T_3> .

<T_0> &apos;ll let <T_5> in on <T_2> answer to the <T_4> one that i offer , and <T_1> is , it has <T_3> to <T_6> with human <T_7> .
i <T_0> to fin@@ ish up on a more up@@ beat <T_1> .
and the reason <T_0> , <T_1> &apos;s about <T_5> and it &apos;s about <T_6> . <T_3> can only <T_2> so much by <T_4> .
but <T_4> is , <T_6> principle , <T_1> way you solve <T_8> &quot; fe@@ ver <T_9> un@@ explained <T_7> &quot; problem , because <T_0> one of those spo@@ ts then becomes a <T_5> for a particular <T_3> of mark@@ ers of disease , <T_2> this will work in du@@ e course .

and we can <T_1> with <T_0> .

<T_1> those <T_0> lead <T_2> things like this .
<T_2> i &apos;d like to play for <T_1> the <T_3> that <T_0> predict .
<T_2> this <T_1> right here , um <T_5> , is <T_0> woman who lives on a <T_3> in <T_4> .

<T_3> can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as <T_9> : sort of <T_8> open <T_4> thing , right , where ideas from <T_1> person can be <T_0> and pro@@ pag@@ ated <T_2> the entire system , that there can be <T_5> versi@@ ons of chinese <T_7> , you know , depen@@ ding on the <T_6> .

the <T_1> writers in <T_0> old <T_4> , <T_5> will <T_2> be surprised to learn , take a <T_3> different <T_6> of this .

<T_3> we <T_0> this to be <T_4> , <T_1> i &apos;ll tell you why <T_2> .
<T_9> we helped <T_5> build <T_4> company , for profit , that would build <T_1> i@@ de &apos;s <T_6> , and start looking at sal@@ es <T_2> expor@@ ts , <T_8> be able to <T_7> into <T_3> kinds of <T_0> .
it &apos;s like science has <T_0> that horri@@ ble story@@ t@@ eller <T_5> we all <T_3> , <T_6> gives us all <T_7> details nobody car@@ es about , where you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , i <T_9> my <T_8> for <T_1> the other day , and <T_4> was wearing these <T_2> .
but <T_2> &apos;t there things <T_0> we <T_1> and don &apos;t <T_4> at the <T_3> time ?

so , i &apos;m not going to quote <T_0> on this .
<T_2> would do <T_1> , <T_0> it &apos;s <T_5> impossible to pen@@ et@@ rate somebody &apos;s physical space <T_4> not get a <T_3> .

i <T_1> love to see google <T_0> inside <T_3> of these <T_2> .
well , i got interested in this because it seem@@ ed to <T_2> that it was <T_1> obvious <T_0> .

now , it &apos;s hard to <T_8> a <T_2> to do de@@ lic@@ ate <T_3> like this , but it turns out <T_0> colleagu@@ e , <T_1> ab@@ be@@ el , who &apos;s <T_9> at <T_5> , has devel@@ el@@ op@@ ed a <T_6> set <T_7> techni@@ qu@@ es for teaching robots <T_4> example .

<T_2> , what <T_3> we had <T_0> up to a spe@@ ct scan <T_5> something <T_4> could <T_1> measure brain function ?
and they <T_1> , &quot; <T_2> , streets <T_0> &apos;t have <T_3> .

and a <T_6> of years ago at am@@ d , we came up with this idea of <T_4> , what <T_5> we create this initi@@ ative we call 50@@ x@@ 15 , where <T_8> are going to a@@ im , <T_9> by <T_0> year 20@@ 15 , half of <T_2> world will be connected to <T_3> internet so that <T_1> and <T_7> can get connected .

thank you very much .
<T_2> , <T_0> followed up . <T_1> happened ?
<T_0> you could pick up <T_2> white <T_4> , it <T_3> look like the <T_1> on the bottom .
so <T_0> me just <T_3> over <T_1> we can do <T_2> live demo .
<T_3> what <T_2> interesting <T_1> the <T_0> that i &apos;ve just said ?
the <T_2> morning <T_1> church , she <T_3> others <T_0> they <T_4> .
<T_3> the <T_0> i <T_2> on here , <T_4> , <T_6> , mon@@ keys <T_1> chimpanze@@ es have the little <T_5> .

so if <T_2> have the <T_1> , <T_0> try it out .
we feel <T_5> individuals with autism , in fact , have a very <T_6> perspective <T_8> the world , and <T_9> need diversity , and <T_3> can work extremely well <T_0> some <T_4> of <T_7> : predi@@ ct@@ able <T_1> , situations that <T_2> be defined .

and the <T_4> is , <T_2> is a <T_5> esti@@ mate because <T_3> don &apos;t <T_6> know <T_1> many <T_0> die each year of this .
so , let &apos;s now say <T_3> this is <T_1> . <T_2> is <T_0> relevant ?
and <T_8> what <T_4> do in the <T_2> step is we rele@@ ase one elephant before the <T_1> , <T_7> that elephant needs to be smart <T_0> to stay there and wait and <T_5> pull at the rop@@ e -- because if he <T_3> at the rop@@ e , <T_6> disappe@@ ars and <T_9> whole test is over .
<T_3> not <T_1> motiv@@ ate you to be@@ have in certain ways , but <T_0> change <T_4> way <T_2> think .
we <T_2> you to be <T_0> eyes , we &apos;ll give <T_1> the <T_3> .

<T_5> it has <T_3> global , moved us <T_2> a global <T_7> of social <T_4> , it has <T_1> us <T_0> moral <T_6> .
<T_2> can add <T_1> third dimension@@ ality to <T_0> film .
it is very important <T_6> recognize <T_4> this <T_5> of <T_1> is the <T_3> stage <T_7> agre@@ eing upon ourselves that there is <T_0> clear <T_2> upon <T_8> we can build .
he <T_1> a <T_0> band .
a lot of these ideas <T_1> into <T_3> production <T_0> for <T_2> .
they <T_4> been using <T_3> for about two <T_2> but <T_5> gro@@ wn <T_1> since <T_0> was pa@@ ying attention .
<T_2> and <T_3> were <T_9> ama@@ zed by the <T_6> now with modern web brow@@ s@@ ers , <T_4> you have <T_8> audi@@ o <T_7> video and <T_1> power <T_5> ja@@ v@@ as@@ cri@@ pt <T_0> ren@@ der amaz@@ ingly fast .

now , the third <T_0> grew <T_4> of my <T_2> when <T_1> father was <T_3> the hospital .
any computer designers <T_0> the <T_1> ?
some ideas <T_8> &apos;ve had <T_9> like , look , the reality <T_3> -- <T_1> in <T_4> south bronx <T_5> ap@@ ples <T_0> car@@ ro@@ ts and <T_6> do <T_7> in <T_2> .
you <T_2> need <T_0> , <T_1> ?
<T_8> then if you <T_2> about it , <T_1> squ@@ id has this <T_0> problem because <T_4> &apos;s got this <T_3> , <T_7> culture of <T_6> and <T_9> can &apos;t <T_5> that .
so , then we <T_1> back to <T_2> and to <T_0> g@@ ym@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist .
and <T_1> that <T_0> to happen .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
<T_0> &apos;s not very <T_1> . it &apos;s <T_2> .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_0> the <T_1> problem .
while <T_1> sele@@ ction process is not <T_2> ri@@ gor@@ ous <T_0> nasa , <T_3> &apos;s nonetheless <T_4> .
it <T_1> three <T_2> kinds <T_0> str@@ ings .
and so <T_3> &apos;s about <T_1> or <T_0> cities already in <T_2> u.s .
which <T_2> ? <T_3> &apos;s a piece of <T_0> . i <T_1> challenges .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_7> &apos;s one last <T_6> in the <T_3> , the <T_1> themselves , <T_0> from al@@ ga@@ e <T_5> bacteria <T_8> fungi , and all over the <T_2> of <T_4> .
<T_3> i &apos;m not <T_4> what the <T_2> way to organi@@ ze <T_1> whole <T_0> is .
the point <T_5> , of <T_3> , <T_6> you want to <T_0> about <T_4> , <T_1> ask a malaria <T_2> .
but , of course , since then , the web <T_1> mobile tele@@ ph@@ ony , along with ubi@@ quit@@ ous reality tv forma@@ ts <T_2> spread all around the <T_0> .

now sometimes neuro@@ scientists <T_3> to identify <T_5> molecular <T_1> of neurons , <T_0> , <T_4> than the <T_2> cell .
it &apos;s just that it doesn &apos;t explain anything .
then <T_6> beings ste@@ pped out of <T_7> darwin@@ ian flow <T_5> evolutionary <T_9> and created the <T_1> great wave of <T_8> , <T_4> we <T_0> the environment <T_3> which <T_2> evolved .
<T_3> had designed a <T_1> station that <T_2> never <T_4> , and so <T_0> followed .

<T_3> , <T_0> is a <T_2> difference in the <T_4> we <T_1> to talk about oil <T_5> the way we &apos;re talking about it <T_6> .
so , having seen <T_5> impact <T_7> this , <T_0> and <T_6> decided <T_2> we needed to really try and <T_9> this up , <T_1> bring the best quality <T_4> to as <T_8> people <T_3> we could .
<T_6> david roll@@ s it around <T_3> this , he &apos;s turning the sling around probably <T_0> six or seven <T_4> per second , and <T_7> means <T_9> when the rock is <T_2> , <T_5> &apos;s going forward really fast , probably <T_8> meters per <T_1> .
i <T_6> -- <T_0> was years <T_5> -- <T_3> saw <T_2> kenne@@ dy and <T_4> qua@@ yle meet in the well of <T_1> sen@@ ate .
men@@ sa , as you <T_0> , is <T_4> international <T_2> for people <T_1> very <T_3> i@@ q .
<T_3> ide@@ als <T_0> partici@@ pat@@ ory <T_2> are repres@@ ented through sup@@ pl@@ eness rather than <T_1> .
and <T_6> &apos;s <T_3> or@@ ch@@ id that might look to you <T_1> if <T_0> &apos;s got ja@@ ws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the <T_5> to <T_4> out , <T_2> covered in po@@ llen that it takes somewhere else .
it &apos;s <T_4> by <T_5> quick <T_3> , which <T_1> how acci@@ dent@@ al <T_8> with <T_7> no@@ ises gave <T_2> some of the <T_0> important <T_6> we have about <T_9> .
and trade <T_0> another <T_2> in@@ cen@@ tive <T_1> violence .
li@@ ke@@ wise , as we &apos;re <T_8> policies to <T_5> to encourage expor@@ ts , <T_1> we know there &apos;s this <T_2> -- <T_4> extra thing that &apos;s going to happen <T_3> we increase <T_6> -- we <T_9> think about what the <T_0> kinds of <T_7> are .
but <T_2> &apos;m convin@@ ced that <T_3> &apos;s because <T_5> &apos;re <T_1> around the <T_4> and seeing <T_0> .
now , each one <T_3> them is <T_0> , &quot; i <T_4> &apos;t <T_1> want to kill that <T_6> , but <T_5> &apos;s about <T_2> kill me .
and <T_1> do i say <T_0> ?
but <T_7> found <T_3> when <T_4> de@@ vi@@ ated from <T_9> specific se@@ t@@ ness of the mathematical <T_0> that under@@ lies it -- the simple <T_6> cro@@ ch@@ et three , <T_8> one -- when we <T_2> from that and made em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to the <T_1> , <T_5> models immediately started to look more natural .
<T_2> of kil@@ os more <T_0> the wing <T_1> .
and <T_2> security decisions have <T_0> variety of <T_1> involved .
it <T_0> the left on a whole <T_2> of issues <T_4> we on the left <T_1> care <T_3> .
<T_8> to what <T_3> people think , <T_1> don &apos;t <T_0> , tax@@ pa@@ yers don &apos;t pay , for <T_2> life <T_5> you &apos;re in <T_9> . <T_6> &apos;ve got to pay <T_7> your <T_4> life .

<T_4> yemen times <T_2> has a strong re@@ pu@@ tation <T_1> yemen <T_0> an independent <T_3> new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
<T_1> add <T_0> to it .
and <T_6> again pro@@ ves that <T_4> you &apos;re talking <T_2> un@@ inten@@ ded <T_0> , <T_7> &apos;s not that <T_3> to know the <T_1> lessons to <T_5> .
and <T_1> was there thinking <T_2> what <T_0> going on .
but <T_2> next <T_1> -- <T_0> that &apos;s <T_3> real thing .
if <T_4> brains were made the same way <T_9> you were <T_1> compare animals with brains of different si@@ zes , <T_7> brains should always have <T_6> neurons <T_0> smaller <T_8> , and the larger <T_2> brain , the more <T_5> able its <T_3> should be .
<T_2> &apos;s common . <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> .
and then finally , just <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;s a <T_1> way .
as we <T_0> to build this view , and try to <T_2> ourselves about the enorm@@ ity of <T_7> culture , the information that we <T_8> to work with is these gi@@ gan@@ tic <T_6> : numbers in the millions , in the <T_4> of <T_5> , in the <T_1> and <T_3> in the <T_9> .
and so <T_4> &apos;m so <T_2> to discuss this <T_9> them , and <T_3> come <T_6> and i <T_7> , &quot; <T_0> somebody please explain the <T_5> ideas <T_8> why this is <T_1> cool ? &quot;
we <T_0> the <T_2> we tell <T_1> .
<T_0> might <T_1> something unexpected .
so <T_5> see that <T_7> of the way we per@@ cei@@ ve <T_1> , <T_3> war dra@@ gs on , the number of <T_4> com@@ mitted to it and <T_6> casu@@ al@@ ties will increase not <T_9> -- like 10,000 , 1@@ 1,000 , 12@@ ,000 -- but <T_2> -- 10,000 , <T_0> 20,000 , later <T_8> .
<T_7> , the <T_0> men@@ tion <T_5> ge@@ o@@ engineering <T_3> being gre@@ et@@ ed in some <T_6> , particularly <T_2> circles , <T_1> a re@@ lief tin@@ ged with <T_4> .
<T_3> need to take <T_0> in <T_6> arms and look at <T_7> in <T_5> eyes <T_2> about <T_4> minutes before <T_1> does something .
they <T_0> band integra@@ tion , that is , the machine <T_1> upon the band members , specifically <T_2> the other way around .
and <T_1> think there <T_2> clearly <T_0> answers to that .
in case you &apos;re finished with toi@@ let <T_2> , <T_3> can te@@ ar <T_0> the inside of the <T_1> .
<T_5> the <T_2> , of <T_1> , <T_8> that den@@ ser <T_7> tend to have <T_4> emissions -- which isn &apos;t really <T_0> that difficult to figure out , <T_6> you think <T_3> it .
and <T_1> do we do <T_0> ?
and <T_1> have to go <T_5> beyond <T_0> diplo@@ macy <T_4> the <T_3> issue <T_2> our times , climate change .
it doesn &apos;t mean that if you are a republi@@ can <T_2> i &apos;m <T_5> to <T_7> you to be a <T_3> . we <T_8> republi@@ cans as well . <T_9> used to be a bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an <T_6> , and i know that <T_0> this <T_4> it really is . become <T_1> active .

<T_2> the <T_1> system is sitting over <T_0> sensory part of <T_3> brain .

even <T_1> you <T_7> try to get all of those <T_0> into your <T_6> by watching all <T_4> thousand ted <T_5> , it <T_9> actually <T_8> take you over <T_3> hours to <T_2> so .

he &apos;s going <T_0> the path .
and <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> all these machines are <T_5> , <T_2> , instead of doing it <T_3> mar@@ bles , they &apos;re doing it with <T_0> .
the truth is , we <T_3> know the out@@ lines , and what <T_1> don &apos;t <T_0> understand , <T_2> can &apos;t proper@@ ly <T_4> .
<T_1> be aware <T_0> the <T_2> .
this has come &apos; ro@@ und to be that <T_0> those <T_2> pa@@ ch@@ y@@ der@@ ms have <T_1> ance@@ stors .
&quot; <T_1> you run <T_3> than <T_0> go@@ ats <T_2> are looking after . &quot;

so <T_2> &apos;s the bert <T_0> designed <T_1> ?
<T_0> started this <T_3> thing off , and <T_5> , you <T_2> , <T_1> are the future , <T_4> computers .

and he <T_0> that <T_3> could actually teach people to do surgery <T_2> video <T_1> .
so i kind of said , &quot; <T_5> , <T_6> &apos;s <T_8> extra <T_4> , <T_1> know , that you <T_9> to <T_3> a <T_7> fro@@ g <T_2> the mom and <T_0> fro@@ g . &quot;

and <T_0> said , &quot; i <T_3> your <T_2> , but <T_1> need <T_4> of them . &quot;
first <T_2> we ever tried <T_0> . we &apos;ll <T_1> to get it better <T_4> but <T_3> months so <T_5> .

so <T_1> does <T_0> take ?
so these are the <T_0> who <T_1> ben@@ j@@ amin .
it &apos;s <T_7> the <T_8> of one <T_2> , a facebook or a google or a b@@ .@@ t@@ . or a <T_3> or a <T_5> war@@ ner , whatever it is , conne@@ cting with usually <T_6> yellow fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ able up into <T_1> cei@@ ling and down <T_9> the rou@@ ter of <T_0> network , and that &apos;s un@@ equi@@ v@@ oc@@ ally physical , and it &apos;s <T_4> inti@@ mate .
<T_3> &apos;s pretty <T_2> , <T_1> why <T_4> get rid <T_0> the wir@@ es ?
so , i &apos;m <T_2> about what &apos;s going to happen <T_3> the <T_0> 5,000 <T_1> .
<T_4> was the <T_5> a@@ thei@@ st <T_2> in the all@@ -@@ white <T_0> school <T_3> by <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> approach <T_2> it all .
so <T_0> &apos;s some <T_1> life .
you might <T_0> seen <T_2> about the po@@ st-@@ election <T_3> that happened there in <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;m a <T_0> lucky <T_1> .
they <T_1> these sex@@ y <T_0> .
<T_2> you need to <T_3> that to be <T_0> is <T_1> enough .
<T_5> a ser@@ mon <T_2> to <T_3> your life and a <T_0> wants to give you <T_4> bit of <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;re going to go on a <T_2> to <T_1> deep sea , and <T_6> that &apos;s had <T_8> lo@@ vely opportunity knows <T_4> for about <T_7> and half hours <T_5> the <T_0> down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
we just <T_4> to him . here &apos;s jen@@ ny , one of the <T_7> , alli@@ son , who helped manage the transplant list , <T_9> a do@@ zen <T_5> people who aren &apos;t pic@@ tured , a <T_8> , <T_3> psych@@ ologist , <T_2> nutri@@ tion@@ ist , even a financial coun@@ sel@@ or , li@@ sa , <T_0> helped us deal <T_6> all the in@@ sur@@ ance <T_1> .
and <T_0> i was <T_1> it , <T_2> happened ?
and <T_1> was <T_0> cause <T_2> celebra@@ tion .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> second of <T_1> quad@@ ru@@ ple .
but when <T_1> were divided , <T_3> they were divided , and we do <T_4> the contin@@ ents car@@ ving <T_2> among <T_0> .
first off , <T_7> and i decided to <T_0> a <T_6> called <T_8> and restore <T_3> would push de-@@ extin@@ ction <T_9> and try to have it go <T_4> a responsible <T_2> , and we would <T_1> ahead with <T_5> pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on .
<T_3> beyond our <T_2> reasons for w@@ ant@@ ing to be <T_5> , <T_1> is <T_0> huge <T_4> .
all <T_6> us who &apos;ve experienced re@@ gre@@ t that <T_2> real <T_7> and real <T_1> understand <T_4> hum@@ or <T_3> even black <T_9> plays a cru@@ cial <T_8> in <T_5> us <T_0> .
so <T_3> is <T_2> we <T_4> . we put <T_1> 10@@ -@@ cent <T_6> trans@@ pon@@ der , a data tag , <T_0> the <T_5> .
now <T_2> is em@@ power@@ ing because it <T_0> the <T_1> .
i <T_2> a <T_0> of people have <T_1> doing that .
now , <T_1> people call <T_2> the <T_0> progra@@ mmer .
<T_2> gradu@@ ate <T_1> then says , well , <T_4> does a dri@@ ver@@ less car communicate <T_3> <T_0> ?
<T_0> was like your <T_1> vision <T_2> europe .
has to <T_2> back <T_0> , whatever <T_1> put in .
<T_1> was <T_4> as first evidence that actually black <T_0> come <T_2> super@@ no@@ va@@ e <T_3> .
i did <T_0> performance <T_3> two <T_1> who <T_5> in making <T_4> no@@ ises <T_2> their mou@@ ths .
what <T_1> am trying to <T_5> as a photograph@@ er , as an <T_4> , is to <T_3> world of <T_2> and science <T_0> .
they <T_1> son@@ gs , po@@ em@@ s , <T_2> , sculp@@ tures , <T_0> , <T_3> , <T_4> .
but , when you go <T_4> another <T_6> data <T_5> -- and let &apos;s say <T_1> is one <T_7> travel , and you say , &quot; i want to <T_0> this <T_9> to <T_3> the people in <T_8> group , &quot; you can &apos;t get over <T_2> walls .
we will <T_2> again have <T_3> political class that <T_1> for@@ ged by the <T_6> of <T_4> together <T_0> world war <T_5> against a <T_7> enemy .
<T_5> &apos;d like to share with you <T_3> that <T_0> , <T_4> also describe my experience <T_2> being <T_1> .
but <T_0> create a space that <T_6> exi@@ sted is <T_1> interests <T_7> ; to create something <T_3> has never been , a <T_2> that <T_9> have never <T_8> except in <T_5> minds and our <T_4> .
<T_4> just can &apos;t <T_1> you -- <T_0> &apos;s one <T_3> i want <T_2> tell you .
after <T_4> months of <T_2> , he came to my office and <T_0> me with <T_3> nine <T_1> on a piece of <T_5> .
and <T_2> i <T_1> , it kind of distur@@ bed <T_0> .
and <T_0> ask that <T_3> -- <T_7> is <T_6> a word <T_2> use very much -- we &apos;ve <T_4> to break it down <T_1> what i think is as@@ k@@ able <T_5> happy .
is <T_3> an <T_2> process by which there &apos;s a sort of <T_1> between <T_5> you &apos;re <T_7> about <T_4> what you <T_6> say <T_0> them ?
and one of <T_1> competi@@ tions , <T_0> just won a small , little <T_2> phili@@ ps radio .
<T_4> could be new <T_1> and <T_5> , but <T_2> could also be <T_0> ways of <T_3> products .
<T_1> one custom@@ er would <T_0> us .
so <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> the most <T_1> part of this <T_0> , <T_2> it &apos;s <T_5> .
when i look back now <T_5> this high hill of <T_9> old age , i <T_6> still see the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed <T_2> and children <T_8> he@@ ap@@ ed and <T_4> all along <T_1> cro@@ o@@ ked gul@@ ch <T_7> pla@@ in as when i saw <T_3> with eyes <T_0> young .

<T_3> this <T_5> you do not work and <T_2> and draw <T_1> a <T_7> of paper , <T_0> you draw directly <T_8> a kind of <T_4> wh@@ ite@@ board ca@@ ve , like <T_6> pre@@ histor@@ ic <T_9> .
<T_0> final <T_1> is , of course , <T_2> product , whether it &apos;s a pack@@ aging material , a table top , or building <T_3> .

<T_0> don &apos;t catch them in <T_1> net .
so , i took 15 different li@@ sts <T_6> key thin@@ kers , like the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia <T_4> , the museum of natural history , car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s <T_9> calendar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my <T_5> ; <T_7> were just <T_0> in reference works , and <T_1> think that &apos;s <T_3> they thought the key events were in <T_2> evolution and <T_8> evolution .

but <T_3> didn &apos;t , <T_7> . <T_8> we &apos;re <T_1> . <T_0> &apos;ll <T_6> what i can . <T_4> &apos;ll do <T_2> i <T_5> .
i think this <T_0> us there <T_1> an opportunity .
<T_0> yet , <T_4> the most part , <T_5> culture has <T_1> come to <T_2> with what <T_3> means .
a long <T_0> ago , back in the <T_2> 190@@ 0s , <T_3> were out <T_1> for <T_4> .
<T_3> &apos;ll explain what that <T_0> . <T_1> &apos;re looking at <T_2> trends .
so <T_2> &apos;s the <T_0> gene <T_3> &apos;re <T_1> for .
but <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> problem : every <T_1> in the <T_6> , every <T_3> , has seen tv <T_5> <T_0> those &quot; e.@@ r. &quot; r@@ er@@ uns <T_7>
thank <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;d <T_1> so much strange <T_3> , <T_0> i <T_2> very natur@@ ally into its <T_4> patterns .
but <T_2> happened was <T_0> ma@@ da@@ gas@@ car went through <T_3> violent <T_1> .
<T_4> if <T_5> remember <T_1> we need to <T_7> agri@@ cultural <T_0> by 70 <T_3> , we &apos;re not going <T_6> make it that <T_2> .
<T_4> every year <T_0> more <T_1> a hundred <T_2> , it &apos;s looked like <T_5> in the <T_3> .
in <T_0> , we &apos;re down to 1,@@ 600 cases .
<T_1> , if <T_4> trends <T_0> , it could all <T_3> gone <T_5> five or <T_2> years &apos; time .
hit@@ ler <T_2> two of them , and <T_1> didn &apos;t have <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> bottom line .
markets have changed beyond <T_1> in <T_3> last 20 <T_2> , but only <T_5> organi@@ zations <T_0> the top <T_6> the <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s up in <T_1> .
<T_0> me introduce to you <T_1> .
i was a <T_6> , and <T_7> 15 <T_0> 16 , i <T_3> like <T_4> teen@@ a@@ gers , <T_1> want <T_9> just <T_5> what we <T_2> and what <T_8> believe in .
<T_1> ? there <T_0> the cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st <T_2> board .
that it &apos;s about <T_1> that doesn &apos;t <T_2> produce greater <T_3> within the <T_6> , <T_4> leads <T_5> real <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s an extreme <T_0> micro@@ p@@ thal@@ mo@@ s <T_1> .
instead , the <T_1> american ads fe@@ at@@ uring wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ha@@ i@@ red <T_0> people <T_3> ads for <T_2> homes and pen@@ sion plan@@ ning .
<T_1> know <T_8> the <T_4> is <T_0> ori@@ ent@@ ation behavior and it &apos;s also a ther@@ mor@@ e@@ gu@@ lation behavior , and we <T_6> know that <T_3> use a path <T_2> system for finding <T_5> way home <T_7>
it &apos;s that <T_0> .
<T_3> , see <T_2> &apos;s the <T_1> as f in <T_0> .
<T_2> didn &apos;t gras@@ p <T_1> was <T_0> on .
<T_0> wa@@ x : <T_3> &apos;s so <T_2> about <T_1> illness ?
<T_2> we <T_0> to come up with a way , as a group , to have <T_3> kind of design s@@ w@@ at <T_1> .
but <T_1> are <T_0> things at heart <T_6> i think drive a <T_3> philosoph@@ y that <T_5> really <T_4> to <T_2> whole <T_7> .
one <T_2> maybe <T_0> the <T_1> number <T_3> patterns to win a no@@ bel <T_4> .
<T_1> lost <T_0> in me being able to <T_2> .
so the <T_4> of a friend <T_6> a &apos;s is , back again , a <T_8> of a &apos;s , <T_7> the friend <T_5> a friend of <T_3> &apos;s is not a friend <T_0> b &apos;s , <T_1> is <T_2> away in the network .
and <T_1> is the <T_0> in well-@@ being over that <T_7> , <T_3> small <T_6> , <T_2> this <T_5> the <T_4> in e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal footprint .
<T_1> the tra@@ ge@@ dy , survival stories began <T_0> emer@@ ge .
<T_3> , <T_2> game created by computer scientists , illu@@ str@@ ates <T_0> value of the <T_1> .

&quot; &apos; <T_1> give <T_0> and i take <T_2> away .
<T_6> the gol@@ den <T_2> is difficult . i <T_5> -- when i &apos;m speaking <T_4> con@@ gre@@ ga@@ tions about <T_3> , i sometimes <T_9> a mu@@ tin@@ ous expression <T_7> some of <T_8> faces because a lot of religi@@ ous people pre@@ fer to be <T_0> , <T_1> com@@ passionate .
and <T_1> we watch <T_2> , <T_0> are as@@ ha@@ med .
<T_0> it was coming in , and arri@@ ving at <T_5> city <T_4> the nor@@ th@@ west , which is why <T_2> , london &apos;s very famous <T_1> market , was <T_3> up there .
and then we <T_4> why <T_0> mem@@ bran@@ e clo@@ gs <T_3> why <T_2> takes so much <T_1> .
<T_1> tam@@ met : <T_2> ways <T_0> knowing
it <T_1> , for a <T_3> time , <T_4> as the <T_2> reli@@ able of <T_6> , <T_5> then they <T_0> the big re@@ call inci@@ dent .
<T_3> was <T_0> done on <T_2> machine <T_1> looks like this .
until <T_3> , these <T_0> have <T_2> a rather <T_1> choice .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ eight <T_1> said moving <T_6> greater <T_0> would help muslims <T_3> -- <T_7> highest <T_4> of any <T_2> we <T_5> .
<T_0> when people are <T_2> , <T_1> don &apos;t <T_3> it away .
<T_2> then third , from <T_5> i &apos;ve <T_0> from the entrepreneurs i &apos;ve gotten to know , when all <T_6> is equal , given the option to have <T_4> money <T_1> do what <T_8> need to do , or money plus the <T_7> and <T_9> of a global community , <T_3> choose the community plus the money .
20 <T_5> back <T_1> political <T_0> was , &quot; ro@@ ti , <T_3> , ma@@ ka@@ an , &quot; which <T_7> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_4> and <T_6> . &quot;
they &apos;re going to save your <T_8> , <T_3> when we figure <T_0> how <T_6> get you the <T_1> of the <T_4> , <T_2> you can <T_9> for that <T_7> and they &apos;ll give <T_5> the grade . &quot;
now <T_0> question comes <T_2> mind : is <T_1> any <T_3> ?
<T_2> what i &apos;m trying to do with <T_1> work is put <T_0> to this .
but business <T_2> usual means that in <T_1> years , there <T_0> be no <T_7> -- and <T_5> commercial fishing , <T_6> the <T_3> will simply be <T_4> .
so <T_3> think this <T_0> why <T_1> human brain grew <T_4> become <T_5> large so <T_8> in evolution , <T_6> of the while rema@@ ining <T_7> a <T_2> brain .
<T_0> &apos;t let <T_2> your <T_1> .
<T_7> actually the <T_0> general <T_2> in vi@@ en@@ na , in about 18@@ 50 , was where we <T_1> to build out <T_3> entire cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um <T_6> teaching <T_5> students <T_4> .
and that <T_4> your <T_2> is going to get its ones <T_1> zer@@ os mix@@ ed up , and that &apos;s going to <T_3> your <T_0> .
so <T_2> is a <T_0> and <T_1> molecule found <T_4> in <T_3> .
you <T_1> about a lot <T_0> them .
and <T_0> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
<T_1> , <T_2> , ten@@ der <T_0> .
the <T_3> of hyper@@ bo@@ lic <T_1> us@@ her@@ ed in <T_4> field of <T_2> that is <T_0> non-@@ eu@@ cli@@ de@@ an geome@@ try .
<T_1> a <T_0> reaction , which <T_2> looks odd ?
and so <T_0> &apos;s an@@ ach@@ r@@ oni@@ st@@ ically <T_2> classi@@ fication by <T_4> &apos; <T_3> , <T_1> single parents go on their <T_5> .
well , at enormous expen@@ se , <T_2> has ar@@ ran@@ ged a high-@@ resol@@ ution immer@@ sion virtual reality ren@@ dering <T_4> inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic <T_3> -- <T_0> view <T_5> inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic <T_1> .
you <T_0> by day , then it <T_2> sun@@ set , so <T_1> went back <T_3> .
<T_2> was <T_3> of the fortunate few <T_4> really did get to <T_0> him and enjo@@ yed <T_1> presence .
<T_2> took <T_1> as execu@@ tive <T_0> .
<T_0> was a <T_1> year .
so <T_1> ac@@ ted like <T_2> two-@@ year-old <T_3> re@@ f@@ used <T_0> work .
<T_0> all of a sudden , <T_2> plastic ba@@ g was extremely <T_1> to me .
so to <T_0> people war@@ med up , let &apos;s start <T_4> an easy <T_3> -- <T_5> i &apos;m sure everybody <T_1> has an op@@ ini@@ on about : iphone versus <T_2> .
den@@ nis van@@ en@@ gel@@ s@@ dor@@ p : <T_2> . <T_0> , <T_1> .
but the <T_5> story is : <T_4> you &apos;re a <T_2> , you <T_1> to be <T_3> the blue <T_0> .
very <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s 12 different drugs , <T_0> different <T_2> .
so what we &apos;d like to <T_7> is <T_8> we <T_4> them to invol@@ ve people <T_5> all around the world in an histor@@ ic first : <T_3> world &apos;s first <T_9> global po@@ ll and <T_6> , where <T_1> everywhere has an equal <T_0> for the very <T_2> time .
<T_0> million dollars <T_7> me <T_8> tv commer@@ ci@@ als <T_1> magazine ads <T_5> sp@@ am <T_9> cou@@ po@@ ns <T_6> shel@@ ving <T_3> and spi@@ ff -- all <T_4> i could ignore every <T_2> message .
<T_1> seren@@ o : dig@@ ging up <T_0>
and <T_4> we started to <T_1> be@@ a@@ vers can <T_3> something <T_0> a bo@@ b@@ c@@ at needs <T_2>
so <T_6> people can <T_0> , &quot; i <T_3> exactly <T_5> and <T_2> and this , &quot; <T_4> you <T_7> go out and <T_1> it .
<T_1> not so much that <T_0> wing has some interesting <T_2> .
<T_1> . what &apos;s that <T_3> about ? <T_4> , <T_2> do know a couple of <T_0> .
<T_1> the bas@@ ics <T_0> driving a <T_3> learning how to <T_2> it , or <T_4> it for that matter ?
and so <T_1> think it &apos;s really , <T_3> matters , i mean , <T_5> you want to use this is <T_9> situations like <T_8> threat situations . <T_7> are you being <T_6> , either <T_2> your friends ? like for <T_0> it &apos;s at <T_4> lun@@ ch@@ room table .
<T_5> probably <T_6> more important is <T_3> the work <T_4> comes out of <T_2> years <T_8> back into <T_7> company <T_1> into society at large , rather than <T_9> benef@@ iting a grand@@ child or <T_0> .
i &apos;m going to ski@@ p ahead <T_3> . at <T_2> point <T_4> get larger , <T_1> we actually get <T_0> a ma@@ cro@@ -@@ evolution scale .
<T_0> ch@@ art is going to docum@@ ent <T_2> very similar <T_1> .
if you saw <T_9> genome for <T_0> mouse <T_5> for a <T_7> it would look no <T_2> than this , <T_3> what <T_8> are doing now is they &apos;re <T_6> what <T_1> do and <T_4> they mean .
one <T_2> what &apos;s <T_0> the boston <T_1> library .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> i have . <T_2> you .
this is the <T_4> of biologi@@ c <T_3> , where <T_1> re@@ place wor@@ n-@@ out <T_5> with <T_2> , natural <T_0> .
well , medical mal@@ practice <T_0> in the <T_4> has es@@ cal@@ ated the <T_6> of mal@@ practice <T_3> , <T_5> that compe@@ tent <T_2> are leaving their <T_1> .
<T_1> the <T_5> who <T_2> there <T_0> looking at <T_3> se@@ ction , it was <T_4> .
<T_3> the <T_5> ves@@ sel@@ s <T_1> are feeding tumor@@ s <T_4> cancer cells to ex@@ it into the <T_2> as <T_0> .
all of <T_5> people are between <T_0> and <T_3> years old , <T_2> they <T_6> the <T_7> that drives <T_4> discovery in <T_1> country .
and why <T_2> is interesting is that <T_4> you put on , say , <T_0> pair of safety glas@@ ses , that have two in@@ fr@@ ared dots in them , what these two dots are essentially going <T_6> give you is , give the <T_3> an <T_1> of <T_5> head location .
<T_5> instead of char@@ ging <T_2> dollar-@@ fif@@ ty <T_0> the ei@@ ght-@@ o@@ un@@ ce <T_1> , the <T_3> that <T_8> &apos;s and <T_4> &apos;s did , they <T_7> to charge four <T_6> .
<T_3> this <T_0> truly <T_1> most amazing thing in the <T_2> .
now let <T_0> move to <T_1> place .
<T_2> &apos;re <T_3> -- they &apos;re paid as <T_1> of the health care teams , just like <T_0> and nur@@ ses <T_4>
that &apos;s what <T_2> want <T_1> side to think <T_0> .
<T_0> wrote in <T_2> re@@ prin@@ ts of <T_1> thing .
<T_0> not what i expected <T_2> trust <T_1> .
so , it &apos;s a fa@@ ke <T_0> .
<T_1> there are <T_2> seconds left on the <T_0> .
now i know that some of you <T_7> this <T_6> is all <T_1> asia <T_9> latin america <T_2> model countries like <T_0> -- and who doesn &apos;t <T_4> a brazi@@ lian <T_8> ? -- <T_5> look at sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an <T_3> .
so , now , <T_1> a lot of web 2.@@ 0 consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts who make a <T_0> of money .
<T_1> of <T_2> taken together <T_0> unlikely .
what <T_4> ask myself is , <T_7> &apos;s society is going to be like , <T_0> the kids today are phenomen@@ ally <T_1> at <T_5> messa@@ ging <T_8> spend a <T_3> amount of on-@@ screen <T_9> , <T_2> have <T_6> gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?
<T_2> : not <T_1> and <T_0> ? boy : <T_3> .
<T_5> follow the <T_3> . <T_6> &apos;re smart <T_1> , we hope , not to <T_7> into <T_0> other . <T_4> go off on their <T_2> .

some of these things are <T_4> stories deep or more , <T_2> one of my cli@@ m@@ bing friends <T_6> that <T_5> reason we actually climb <T_9> night <T_7> because if <T_1> ever saw the <T_3> of <T_8> we &apos;re cli@@ m@@ bing over , we would <T_0> do it .

so , an opti@@ mal <T_6> is low in <T_5> , low in <T_3> bad <T_7> , high in <T_0> good <T_1> and <T_4> of the <T_2> f@@ ats .

<T_0> was a <T_1> of negative energy , built up in there .

and so with <T_1> , it &apos;s very <T_0> co@@ stly .

<T_0> we wanted <T_4> see <T_1> we <T_3> introduce this char@@ co@@ al-@@ making <T_2> there .

<T_2> you live a <T_0> life , there &apos;s a <T_1> percent <T_3> you &apos;ll develop arth@@ ri@@ tis .
we &apos;d put <T_4> in <T_6> environment where <T_5> didn &apos;t want <T_8> be , <T_2> they <T_7> &apos;t want to <T_0> what <T_3> wanted <T_1> to do .

there is <T_0> invisible <T_3> all around us , each <T_1> with a <T_2> to tell ...
<T_2> are <T_6> future <T_5> i <T_8> to make <T_0> not be <T_4> of being the <T_7> and being <T_1> , don &apos;t think outside the <T_3> .

the <T_2> is : <T_1> aware <T_0> the propaganda .
all right .
so this <T_3> not be <T_1> perfect <T_0> for sta@@ ying <T_2> longer .
<T_2> &apos;s the <T_0> data explosion that we &apos;re having <T_1> now .
<T_5> : so you see <T_3> , <T_6> didn &apos;t <T_4> back . <T_2> , <T_8> was <T_1> un@@ inten@@ ded side effect of <T_0> experiments <T_7> were doing .
<T_5> that too <T_0> a basis for having <T_3> , <T_2> understanding <T_4> place in <T_1> world .
<T_3> - <T_0> , - <T_1> - <T_4> , are <T_2> prime numbers .
<T_0> you take <T_4> mobi@@ us <T_5> and se@@ w their <T_2> edge together , <T_6> get <T_7> of these , and <T_3> make them <T_1> of glass .
<T_8> , d@@ .@@ c. , <T_7> year , actually <T_6> the nation <T_5> new green <T_1> , and <T_4> &apos;re funding <T_0> in part thanks to a <T_2> ta@@ x on <T_3> bag@@ s .

<T_2> &apos;re about to do six <T_0> the u.k. next <T_1> .
as <T_0> refer@@ r@@ als began to decre@@ ase , <T_4> clearly became <T_7> depres@@ sed <T_6> i <T_5> , <T_1> god , i <T_2> &apos;t work <T_3> .
and i <T_2> that one of <T_5> happ@@ i@@ est things <T_3> the sense <T_4> with my <T_0> i &apos;ve been able to introduce them into the very small <T_1> of <T_8> who <T_9> lucky enough , or possibly <T_7> enough , to <T_6> climb trees .
now , all <T_0> changes <T_2> a <T_1> en@@ ters the scene .
now i &apos;m <T_3> to <T_0> you what <T_2> does to <T_1> societies .
<T_8> , some societies , for sub@@ tle environmental reasons , are more fra@@ gi@@ le than others . and then <T_6> , another gener@@ alization . i &apos;m now teaching a course <T_1> ucla , to ucla under@@ gradu@@ ates , on <T_2> collap@@ ses of <T_7> . what really bu@@ gs <T_4> ucla under@@ gradu@@ ate students is , how on earth did <T_0> societies <T_5> see <T_3> they <T_9> doing ?
<T_0> this is <T_1> .
and it will be sub-@@ orbital . and the <T_2> it has to be sub-@@ orbital is , there <T_6> not solutions for ade@@ qu@@ ate safety to fly <T_3> public to or@@ bit . the governments have been <T_0> this -- three <T_5> have been doing this <T_8> 45 years , and still <T_7> percent of <T_4> people that have left <T_1> atmosphere <T_9> died .
so it &apos;s <T_1> the final story , but <T_4> &apos;s an <T_3> powerful <T_0> of <T_2> we know <T_7> nature at the <T_5> basic <T_6> .
<T_3> in our <T_4> , <T_8> we <T_0> on spo@@ il@@ ing , wa@@ sting our <T_1> resources , <T_2> we keep on building things that consu@@ me so much energy <T_5> most of the companies now go ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt , it &apos;s clear <T_6> we &apos;ll never give the <T_9> to the next generation without a major <T_7> .
can <T_1> even imagine <T_0> that looks <T_2> ?
when <T_1> post@@ war sub@@ ur@@ bs <T_7> first built out on <T_0> cheap land <T_5> from <T_3> , <T_2> made sense to just <T_4> surface <T_6> lots .
<T_3> we think <T_0> communication , we <T_2> about <T_1> .
and <T_2> &apos;s really so <T_1> ; <T_3> &apos;s like <T_0> dancing <T_4> .

i mean to be able to take <T_1> your home <T_2> you &apos;d have to be <T_3> <T_0> .
and i &apos;m <T_4> that <T_6> &apos;s something <T_0> we <T_5> recognize , <T_2> we see <T_1> it <T_3> .
<T_3> even though i <T_1> absolutely <T_6> idea <T_2> i was going to do , <T_5> that <T_0> came a sense of <T_4> .
<T_1> com@@ bin@@ ation of spin , on <T_3> one hand , and <T_2> internet <T_4> the <T_0> .
that you can , not <T_7> see the marg@@ ins right there <T_9> a <T_1> level , but you can see it <T_0> if <T_4> &apos;s not <T_6> on the <T_3> -- even <T_8> it &apos;s <T_5> your field of <T_2> .
let &apos;s <T_2> i &apos;m going to <T_1> the <T_3> right <T_0> .
and i <T_1> to end <T_5> the <T_0> that some of <T_3> know , <T_4> wes@@ ley <T_2> , new <T_6> subway hero .

<T_6> it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affe@@ cting our <T_4> , but it starts to go up -- because <T_5> think <T_1> can start corre@@ cting our <T_8> and bring it down -- <T_9> there &apos;s <T_3> growing footprint that &apos;s happening in asia , <T_0> is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so i don &apos;t think we can equ@@ alize it . so ultimately the strategy , i think , here is that we have to be very concern@@ ed about their evolution , <T_7> it is going to be connected to our <T_2> as well .
each <T_1> f@@ its into <T_0> partner re@@ cep@@ tor <T_3> no <T_2> .
dr. v : <T_6> used to sit <T_0> the <T_5> village man <T_4> i <T_1> from a <T_9> , and suddenly <T_7> turn around and seem to be in cont@@ act with his <T_2> being , you seem to <T_3> one <T_8> him .
we <T_2> art students getting together , taking <T_3> radi@@ ator parts <T_1> doing an ir@@ on-@@ po@@ ur <T_0> make something new out of <T_4> .
<T_0> elements of <T_2> , <T_1> doesn &apos;t get any <T_3> real than that .
<T_1> didn &apos;t know <T_0> things .
and <T_1> have <T_4> who <T_0> -- you &apos;re <T_5> . <T_3> a <T_6> , <T_2> can &apos;t say that .
so <T_8> learn a <T_4> from <T_9> , <T_2> i men@@ tion <T_3> because <T_7> is one <T_1> , <T_6> south africa , where <T_0> 20 years on , there is <T_5> .
<T_2> we &apos;ve all <T_0> these . these <T_1> the &quot; your speed limit &quot; sig@@ ns .
and , as of <T_1> , <T_2> &apos;s made of <T_0> things .
i <T_3> a <T_5> with me , and went <T_1> this <T_6> , found <T_4> grandmother , sat <T_2> with <T_0> .
so <T_1> military <T_0> is bo@@ und to <T_2> enormous .
they <T_4> her the &quot; tree <T_0> , &quot; but <T_3> &apos;s more <T_2> the <T_1> lady .
and <T_5> it fir@@ es <T_2> little <T_1> of <T_3> , there &apos;s going to <T_6> a <T_0> dot and <T_4> click .
i <T_2> you <T_0> that 90 percent <T_1> rate .
so there are two <T_1> going <T_0> .
i <T_0> &apos;t know <T_1> needs a cor@@ n sh@@ eller .
and one of the reasons <T_7> he designed roo@@ fs <T_9> way <T_8> because it &apos;s -- he <T_3> it <T_6> that you <T_0> build such <T_5> strong structure that &apos;s made of <T_1> few materials <T_4> can be supported by <T_2> few points .
<T_3> failure <T_0> you , then you <T_1> &apos;t <T_2> this .
to <T_2> it &apos;s <T_1> incredible <T_0> to be <T_4> now and to be <T_5> to <T_3> this thing .
<T_5> is , for <T_1> , tech@@ ne@@ ti@@ um <T_3> a radio@@ active <T_0> with <T_2> deca@@ y time <T_4> 4@@ .@@ 2 million years .
<T_3> we <T_8> use such <T_1> , that &apos;s being passi@@ vely <T_0> , to <T_2> these whole <T_4> and <T_7> who is located <T_5> within the <T_6> .
<T_2> can take a <T_0> in <T_3> , <T_1> .
this <T_1> economy really is helping the re@@ vi@@ val of the world <T_0> .
and so when we <T_4> ourselves <T_0> sc@@ or@@ ec@@ ard to say <T_1> , where <T_6> we <T_8> to <T_5> goal <T_2> 20@@ 15 , the <T_7> that becomes appar@@ ent <T_3> three <T_9> .
so <T_3> are <T_2> to a <T_1> people there <T_0> .
it &apos;s <T_9> similar to a ru@@ bens &apos; tube , and it &apos;s <T_4> used for visu@@ ali@@ zing <T_0> physical <T_8> of <T_5> , such as <T_2> , <T_7> let &apos;s fire <T_6> up <T_1> see what <T_3> does .
<T_6> have <T_0> studio in ber@@ lin -- <T_1> me cu@@ e <T_5> -- <T_3> down there in this snow <T_4> just <T_2> wee@@ k@@ end .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> idea .
and <T_2> run our <T_0> like this , by the <T_1> .
he <T_1> in <T_0> when the <T_2> out there .
we might <T_0> to te@@ ar those <T_1> up <T_4> start to look at <T_2> op@@ tions and <T_6> open-@@ minded to <T_3> the <T_5> .
and <T_0> discovered <T_2> human counter@@ parts are <T_1> .
in 2003 , we <T_0> our first <T_1> .
<T_4> with these <T_2> of anti@@ bodies , <T_3> know <T_0> can <T_1> them .
in india , <T_7> the first <T_8> of life , from <T_6> to one , boy and girl <T_4> basically <T_5> at the <T_0> rate because they dep@@ end upon <T_3> breast , <T_9> the breast <T_2> no <T_1> .
<T_0> first <T_1> is water .
<T_5> they <T_2> about life is <T_1> get up in the morning , and if <T_0> engine <T_3> , they go to <T_4> .
so , you <T_1> , i <T_0> what i <T_2> with <T_3> students .
<T_5> the first <T_0> , actually , in a long time i <T_1> to meet those <T_2> , i <T_6> to meet these <T_4> , <T_7> see for myself <T_3> their <T_8> were actually about .
it <T_0> off , <T_1> walk in <T_2> door .
<T_2> so i &apos;ll leave you <T_0> this <T_1> .
<T_0> is <T_1> . <T_4> &apos;s bl@@ us@@ hing <T_2> his <T_3> being made !
but <T_6> -- <T_4> here &apos;s <T_7> trick -- fe@@ hr <T_5> ga@@ chter said , on <T_0> sev@@ ent@@ h ro@@ und , they told <T_1> , &quot; you know <T_2> ? new <T_3> .
<T_3> it wasn &apos;t <T_1> , you had <T_2> use something <T_0> .
is <T_3> all we would do ? and <T_2> is <T_0> interesting <T_1> .
<T_1> great example <T_0> fi@@ deli@@ ty .
so <T_8> &apos;s <T_7> of <T_4> gra@@ ins of po@@ llen there , and <T_0> &apos;s the pi@@ stil there , and <T_9> are the little <T_3> called <T_2> . and <T_1> &apos;s what makes the <T_6> give a fra@@ gr@@ ance , and plants actually <T_5> with one another through their fra@@ gran@@ ces .
more recently , <T_8> the cost of <T_3> groups communicate with each other <T_7> fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big <T_9> to <T_5> -- there has been a second answer , which is to put the <T_2> into <T_0> infrastructure , to design systems that co@@ ordin@@ ate <T_4> output of the group <T_6> a b@@ y-@@ product of the oper@@ ating <T_1> the system , without reg@@ ard to institu@@ tional models .
<T_3> talked about before <T_1> h <T_4> n spi@@ kes on <T_0> surface of the <T_2> virus .
<T_3> , the <T_0> is real , but <T_2> is the <T_1> .
she &apos;s the one who <T_3> me how <T_4> draw and , more <T_0> , <T_1> to <T_2> .
this <T_0> mar@@ la ol@@ m@@ stead <T_1> did most of her <T_2> when she was <T_4> years <T_3> .
and <T_1> , technology meant <T_4> i could do the fa@@ st@@ est <T_3> over 100 meters , and stop within a couple of <T_7> of <T_2> ground <T_8> mel@@ ting <T_0> rop@@ e with the fri@@ ction , <T_5> of the <T_6> i used in the des@@ cen@@ der <T_9> .
there &apos;s two <T_1> that i &apos;ve <T_2> in the <T_0> year .
the <T_0> was to make <T_5> cr@@ ater to <T_7> the <T_4> and <T_1> what was underneath <T_6> surface of <T_2> com@@ et , which we learned quite <T_3> bit about .
and then , as these animals swi@@ m and <T_0> us the information that &apos;s important <T_7> climate <T_9> , <T_6> also think <T_5> &apos;s critical to get this information <T_4> the public , <T_3> engage <T_2> public <T_8> this kind of <T_1> .
and listen , <T_1> &apos;m a <T_0> woman .
<T_2> is the great <T_0> forward , <T_3> china <T_1> down .
we can integra@@ te <T_0> the surface , <T_3> the <T_4> usually <T_2> a capital <T_1> .
but ultimately , the government <T_5> in the end , because the <T_8> of the <T_1> public , <T_2> certainly the <T_4> of members of parliament , came to <T_3> conclusion <T_0> it was <T_7> something that <T_6> not be toler@@ ated in <T_9> civili@@ zed society .
<T_1> instead <T_3> what it <T_2> , our <T_4> was on <T_0> way it worked .
you know , it &apos;s very <T_1> to walk <T_0> a <T_2> class .
knowledge <T_2> intelligence <T_0> power , and as <T_4> becomes <T_6> distribu@@ ted , there &apos;s a <T_1> distribution and de@@ cent@@ r@@ alization <T_5> dis@@ ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation of power that &apos;s under@@ way in <T_3> world today .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_1> that <T_3> &apos;s an <T_4> that comes up out of <T_0> .
so <T_0> know <T_1> to <T_2> .
<T_2> try to make <T_0> , <T_3> , <T_1> change .
and <T_2> to explain <T_6> , we need <T_1> really bring people in and <T_5> them realize how <T_4> <T_0> part of their <T_3> .
so <T_3> talked <T_0> kids <T_4> that , and we really <T_2> to feed kids <T_1> food .
<T_7> stood in front of <T_4> screen one <T_1> in <T_2> with <T_0> of my sen@@ ior <T_8> and <T_5> watched <T_3> fire@@ fight from one of our <T_6> .
so this inter@@ depen@@ dent <T_5> which <T_8> been pretty <T_0> to <T_7> of <T_1> -- which is <T_6> we &apos;re <T_9> here in <T_3> doing what we do <T_4> a living , enjo@@ ying this evening -- is <T_2> un@@ equal .
<T_3> instru@@ ments <T_0> loud <T_5> that they <T_2> be heard without <T_1> , etc . , <T_4> .
<T_6> i &apos;m <T_5> , &quot; <T_3> i &apos;m <T_1> and <T_4> &apos;s cheap , <T_2> you know , i <T_0> of like pittsburgh . &quot;
<T_1> , that <T_0> ja@@ w-@@ dro@@ pping , as they say .
ak : in port eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth , the <T_0> outside port eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth in <T_1> .
but <T_2> want to <T_4> you something <T_3> -- and here <T_0> is , so <T_1> now .
<T_2> want your <T_4> to do what <T_1> ask them to do , and <T_3> they &apos;ve done that , then they can <T_0> extra .
<T_4> -- something <T_8> i can tell <T_7> a <T_1> story about because i personally <T_5> on one <T_6> the <T_3> deb@@ ts on <T_2> continent -- <T_0> come down dra@@ matically .
<T_0> con@@ tain <T_1> .
so <T_4> started <T_5> , and he <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> really need a <T_3> way to measure <T_2> . &quot;
<T_3> e.@@ u@@ . <T_4> became <T_1> cur@@ ren@@ cy block , and is <T_0> the most powerful <T_2> block in the entire <T_5> .
<T_1> when <T_2> do read the <T_0> , it &apos;s <T_3> quite remarkable .
<T_1> experience taught <T_5> to empa@@ th@@ ize more <T_3> my <T_2> , <T_0> especially <T_4> with retin@@ al diseases .
most of <T_5> will <T_7> happy to know <T_4> the <T_3> of the <T_1> &apos;s free , and <T_2> of you &apos;ll be happy to know <T_6> it <T_0> be@@ er .
<T_7> &apos;s <T_4> animals -- <T_5> think <T_3> and ap@@ es can do <T_2> kind of thing -- <T_0> there are <T_1> few <T_8> who <T_6> do that .
thank you .
<T_2> instru@@ ctions <T_0> go@@ ver@@ n this operation <T_1> be given in absolutely <T_3> detail .
how <T_0> a <T_2> in a <T_1> work ?
<T_3> san@@ che@@ z : <T_2> &apos;m going to make an obser@@ vation <T_0> the way <T_4> culture seems <T_1> be evol@@ ving ...

<T_3> , some are <T_1> for opportunities <T_0> this new <T_2> .
now <T_6> , natur@@ ally there &apos;s <T_1> gap <T_8> their kind of condu@@ ct in <T_5> meetings and <T_2> behavior <T_4> rest of the <T_7> , <T_0> the truth <T_3> it didn &apos;t really <T_9> us .
<T_3> when <T_4> actually visu@@ alize it , <T_9> the conne@@ ctions that <T_8> &apos;re doing <T_5> now -- <T_2> is an <T_1> of the <T_7> of the internet -- it <T_6> &apos;t look <T_0> .

this process <T_0> a <T_1> cal@@ cul@@ ated <T_2> .
well , first you have <T_2> , as an <T_1> , scop@@ e the <T_4> . <T_0> big <T_3> it ?
<T_2> won &apos;t be <T_0> . thank <T_1> .
<T_1> can &apos;t <T_3> to the <T_0> global <T_2> good .
<T_3> &apos;m going to <T_4> so <T_2> of it . <T_1> &apos;m going to be so <T_0> .
but in any <T_4> , what <T_6> &apos;m going to do <T_5> my little bit of <T_3> is take you on a <T_2> tour of some of the <T_7> that <T_0> talk about and we think <T_1> .
and <T_0> call <T_2> &quot; home@@ town <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> you <T_1> &apos;t change <T_7> re@@ venue picture , <T_4> you don &apos;t <T_5> what you &apos;re <T_3> in <T_0> , you &apos;re going to be d@@ ein@@ v@@ est@@ ing <T_6> the young .
the <T_0> h@@ its it <T_1> .
the <T_2> thing we need to do <T_3> we <T_5> to just look back at how far <T_0> have come in such <T_1> short <T_4> .
i hope i <T_4> to go out of my way <T_1> try <T_0> read <T_2> understand all the <T_3> .
then the <T_1> of <T_3> station is only <T_0> about <T_2> percent .
and <T_4> don &apos;t have time <T_0> go into the information <T_3> will <T_2> some of these things to you , save to <T_6> that there are <T_8> bright <T_5> , in the best universities , studying <T_7> in animals , <T_1> person@@ alities in <T_9> .
<T_0> left .
the cool <T_3> is <T_6> we &apos;re doing as well : <T_4> you <T_0> with him , you &apos;re able to put <T_5> into <T_1> world ; he <T_2> objects .
there &apos;s <T_2> a@@ version to <T_4> problems , <T_3> descri@@ bes <T_1> percent of my <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_1> that they &apos;re do@@ d@@ gy , <T_0> they &apos;re <T_2> to want to try and <T_3> you off .
<T_3> did <T_6> speak about <T_9> , in india . he <T_8> , &quot; to <T_7> who <T_5> to go without two <T_0> a <T_2> , god <T_4> only appear <T_1> bread . &quot;
<T_2> use , now , a <T_1> new <T_0> .
<T_2> think <T_3> couldn &apos;t be <T_4> if you <T_0> &apos;t ask <T_1> questions .
<T_0> if <T_4> come back <T_3> , during a <T_2> condition to the <T_1> same <T_5> , this is what &apos;s left .
<T_2> so to <T_3> one , <T_5> guy <T_1> that , <T_4> hang on to <T_0> .
it &apos;s particularly <T_5> -- <T_2> isn &apos;t on the <T_4> wide <T_3> , is it ? i &apos;m about <T_9> get fi@@ red -- <T_0> &apos;s <T_6> important <T_8> you never put the quality of your life in the hands of <T_1> commercial <T_7> .

we really do have <T_3> going right that <T_1> continent <T_2> growing at rates that <T_0> had thought would not happen .

<T_1> &apos;s see <T_3> happens . <T_2> experiment &apos;s <T_0> done many , many times .
because <T_4> , <T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> about <T_2> , and the <T_0> of <T_5> .
<T_4> do you think <T_2> fo@@ ie <T_0> that 99@@ .@@ 99@@ 9@@ 99 <T_3> of the world <T_1> ?

<T_1> you need to <T_4> is <T_3> the children <T_0> the adults <T_2> flo@@ wers in <T_5> life .
<T_4> nobody knows <T_1> hard that <T_0> , but <T_2> &apos;ll probably find out <T_3> a <T_5> years .
<T_6> problem that <T_8> had with <T_7> i is <T_9> was <T_1> too <T_4> in the body . we had so <T_2> mot@@ ors , <T_3> know , <T_0> the jo@@ in@@ ts , <T_5> those kinds of things .
entrepreneurs <T_3> people -- because we have a lot <T_1> them in this <T_4> -- who have <T_0> ideas and <T_5> passi@@ ons or <T_9> these needs in <T_2> world <T_8> we <T_6> to stand up <T_7> do it .
that <T_6> , impact <T_4> gener@@ ated <T_0> people , what they consu@@ me <T_1> their <T_3> , <T_2> how <T_5> is produced .
<T_5> : their production <T_2> been supported by <T_1> agen@@ cies <T_4> the expen@@ se of a more health@@ - <T_3> ear@@ th-@@ friend@@ ly <T_0> .
<T_2> suddenly , it started to get <T_1> front <T_0> .
and <T_1> i was an adoles@@ cent , i <T_2> that i &apos;m gay , <T_3> so i <T_4> can &apos;t have a <T_0> .
and -- <T_8> so i prin@@ ted out her -- <T_6> i <T_3> a <T_4> of her blog to her family , and they passed it out at her memor@@ ial <T_5> , and <T_2> in her <T_0> , they men@@ tioned her <T_7> because it was such a <T_9> part of <T_1> life .
so <T_4> &apos;s the <T_0> of the <T_3> that <T_1> activ@@ ated <T_5> you give a word to <T_2> .
<T_1> the business programs <T_2> started pi@@ cking <T_0> on this .
<T_0> do you do <T_1> you <T_2> ?
but <T_1> point <T_5> to say , when <T_0> talk about saving <T_8> , <T_7> helping people <T_3> b@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h <T_2> 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking <T_6> a <T_4> b@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ hi .
so <T_1> is <T_0> .
<T_2> that &apos;s why getting <T_0> good education <T_1> so <T_3> .
but <T_8> you look at creative practice <T_6> a <T_2> of research , or art <T_3> a <T_4> r &amp; amp <T_9> <T_0> for humanity , then how <T_1> a cy@@ ber illu@@ sion@@ ist like myself <T_7> his research <T_5>
despite <T_0> of ani@@ mo@@ sity , <T_5> of <T_3> and <T_4> of <T_2> killed , 199@@ 8 saw the conclusion of an <T_1> agre@@ ement .
i &apos;m <T_0> , <T_1> ?
it &apos;s got to <T_6> relatively <T_2> , so <T_0> can run it <T_8> a <T_3> machine , <T_4> it &apos;s got to be accurate <T_7> , <T_5> it looks <T_1> enough , basically .
so you &apos;ve <T_0> got to think <T_1> this , and you &apos;ve all got to vote -- and <T_2> &apos;re not moving <T_3> .
when <T_2> was in college , i decided to <T_0> engineering , like <T_1> .
this <T_0> is called &quot; <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> terrible , <T_1> .
<T_2> therefore want to encourage public <T_0> in <T_1> . &quot;
how <T_5> they different , and <T_4> are the differences they are going <T_0> make <T_6> shape the <T_3> of china , or <T_2> large , the <T_1> ?
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> years ago .
<T_0> lo@@ b@@ o has traveled the <T_4> , taking photographs that tell stories of unusual human <T_6> . in this ha@@ un@@ ting <T_7> , he <T_8> contro@@ versi@@ al <T_2> with <T_1> , so that we see <T_9> pain of a liber@@ ian war cri@@ min@@ al , the qu@@ ie@@ t streng@@ th of un women peac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers <T_5> the per@@ sever@@ ance of <T_3> &apos;s under@@ appreci@@ ated fire@@ figh@@ ters .
thank you .
<T_8> my <T_1> thought <T_3> that <T_2> , of course , by conser@@ ving <T_6> , <T_5> , po@@ tat@@ oes , and the other <T_0> , we may , quite simply , <T_4> up saving <T_7> .
<T_1> do you <T_0> ?
they <T_1> what &apos;s <T_0> there .
<T_1> cannot <T_3> these <T_2> unless <T_0> work together .
which <T_0> , <T_1> happens <T_2> these <T_4> , three-@@ dimensional worl@@ ds should actually <T_3> ?

you &apos;re actually <T_1> and <T_2> quantum information <T_0> .
you spoke <T_0> the <T_2> of the <T_1> .

<T_3> life <T_2> to exp@@ and and exp@@ and <T_0> exp@@ and , until it <T_1> .
i <T_0> we <T_3> study all the <T_4> , because <T_5> you think <T_1> words , you can <T_6> beautiful expres@@ sions from <T_2> hum@@ ble <T_7> .
we built this <T_2> in new <T_6> , actually , as <T_0> theore@@ tical <T_5> on the <T_9> of a technical <T_8> soon to come , and the reason we <T_7> this site <T_4> just show you what these buildings may <T_1> like , because the <T_3> can change .
<T_4> there <T_2> zero <T_0> between i@@ q <T_3> emotional <T_1> , feeling with the other person .
<T_0> c@@ ant@@ u : and <T_1> &apos;m <T_2> .
i &apos;ve become very <T_2> with <T_1> dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional <T_0> .
that &apos;s what i really try <T_1> get people <T_0> understand .
and <T_2> scar@@ es you , <T_1> it fri@@ gh@@ tens <T_0> .
and <T_1> big <T_0> , of <T_2> , is why ?
the reason <T_1> know <T_3> story is <T_2> he &apos;s my <T_0> .
so no@@ am and i had this in@@ sight that if we <T_2> our students to understand how <T_6> work , and understand it <T_1> the mar@@ row of their b@@ ones , <T_5> perhaps the <T_8> way to go about it is to have them build <T_7> complete , working , gener@@ al-@@ pur@@ pose , <T_3> computer , hard@@ ware and <T_4> , from the <T_0> up , <T_9> first principles .
unbe@@ know@@ nst to <T_0> at <T_2> time , because <T_5> had only seen <T_1> outside , the <T_9> were <T_8> to fold themselves , to grow on the <T_3> of the <T_6> , <T_4> was <T_7> a surprising discovery .
<T_1> jack@@ son : an <T_0> reality check
<T_7> bar@@ ack re@@ minded <T_2> on that <T_4> , <T_1> of us in that <T_0> , that we all <T_3> what <T_6> world <T_5> look like .
well , it <T_7> to me that this <T_1> presence in <T_0> life is difficult to <T_8> for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an ad@@ mi@@ ration <T_3> people with a complex moral <T_2> , with <T_9> her@@ it@@ age of <T_4> and de@@ fe@@ at mat@@ ched by <T_5> and <T_6> .
so <T_0> put <T_4> in <T_5> bas@@ ement , <T_1> we got <T_6> serious <T_2> food , like serious <T_3> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_4> like we &apos;re making <T_2> mini@@ -@@ device for <T_3> of the <T_1> cell types .
<T_1> was <T_0> easi@@ est way .
the <T_1> who as a <T_4> had <T_0> with <T_3> through fields <T_5> broken his <T_2> .
<T_1> have to <T_0> it out .
as <T_1> took off <T_4> his <T_2> , there was <T_0> in his <T_3> .
<T_3> fun@@ ny@@ cat@@ s@@ .@@ ex@@ e , which ru@@ mor has it was <T_2> successful <T_1> china &apos;s recent campaign <T_0> america .
b@@ r : and we &apos;re che@@ fs . so when mo@@ to opened in 2004 , people <T_6> &apos;t really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese <T_3> , and <T_8> it was the name , maybe it was the <T_0> , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requ@@ ests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten <T_7> requ@@ est <T_1> a ma@@ ki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of prin@@ ted food , <T_9> this was the <T_4> for@@ a@@ y into <T_2> we like to call fla@@ vor transformation . so this is all the <T_5> , all the fla@@ vor of , you know , a standard ma@@ ki roll , prin@@ ted onto a little piece of paper .
so <T_0> question ar@@ ises : when do <T_1> citizens of <T_2> world turn <T_5> the langu@@ a@@ ge-@@ bo@@ und <T_4> that we <T_3> ?
and the <T_1> went <T_0> .
<T_2> central metaph@@ or <T_0> a <T_1> .
&quot; <T_0> anyway , i am <T_1> away . &quot;
<T_0> more expensive .
so , let &apos;s go for <T_6> , and <T_3> wish <T_4> an <T_5> adv@@ enture <T_0> the wings of <T_1> future . <T_2> you .
so <T_2> is <T_0> magnetic res@@ on@@ ance <T_1> .

<T_2> &apos;ve described to <T_3> the <T_0> of a <T_1> story .
you &apos;re talking <T_1> inclu@@ sive <T_0> .
and the <T_3> people who saw that <T_2> the tele@@ gra@@ pher@@ s <T_0> the mi@@ d-@@ 19@@ th <T_4> , who <T_5> the <T_1> hack@@ ers .
<T_8> it asked <T_2> to rate it <T_3> terms of the quality <T_5> working <T_1> , people <T_0> the robot <T_7> <T_4> they tru@@ sted <T_6> robot more .
<T_4> is <T_1> science <T_2> how we know in the <T_5> world if <T_3> is good for you or <T_0> for you .
what do i <T_0> ? i <T_1> a lot of <T_2> .
when <T_2> started par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma we had <T_1> idea <T_0> direction <T_3> were taking .
it had to do <T_1> death <T_0> disease and <T_3> of other <T_2> .
<T_0> who has kids <T_3> that if <T_4> offer a kid <T_2> big co@@ okie <T_8> a small co@@ okie , which <T_5> are <T_7> going to take ? <T_6> big <T_1> .

<T_4> do <T_9> ins@@ ist on <T_2> -- <T_5> , they <T_3> into this <T_1> -- why do they <T_6> , &quot; my <T_8> starts with <T_0> or <T_7> ? &quot;
so <T_0> in mind <T_3> she &apos;s never <T_2> this <T_1> .
it &apos;s been ta@@ ped with <T_2> that we <T_1> stopped using <T_0> the u.@@ k .
well , there were <T_1> satelli@@ tes <T_2> were particularly <T_0> .
we can <T_3> take a <T_0> out of <T_4> window <T_1> manhattan <T_2> see <T_5> that <T_7> looked like 400 <T_6> ago .
now , if <T_2> think you <T_1> some <T_0> yellow -- i &apos;ll <T_3> this a <T_4> more times .
and <T_1> ignor@@ ed <T_2> message <T_3> i don &apos;t have a pain <T_0> .
sometimes <T_2> don &apos;t even have <T_4> food , and <T_1> live <T_3> the <T_0> .
we &apos;re <T_6> to -- maybe we &apos;ll change it -- but anyway , it &apos;s a war room <T_0> try <T_5> co@@ ordin@@ ate all the attack that &apos;s going on in africa , all the <T_1> social <T_2> in africa , <T_4> try to look at <T_3> practic@@ es .
and <T_0> was an <T_2> thing , working with <T_1> u.@@ n .
these <T_2> the natural <T_0> in <T_1> .
<T_5> people don &apos;t . <T_1> if <T_3> like them , we &apos;ve <T_2> to decide <T_4> we want to do on these <T_0> going forward .
<T_2> , as <T_3> &apos;ll explain to <T_1> , <T_5> questions on the <T_0> and the largest <T_4> are actually very <T_6> .
<T_1> is the final <T_3> . <T_2> they sent it to <T_0> , i <T_4> i &apos;d <T_5> .
i <T_1> &apos;t <T_2> we know <T_0> yet .
so what it &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s replac@@ ing the retin@@ al circu@@ it@@ ry , really the <T_3> of <T_5> retin@@ al circu@@ it@@ ry , <T_0> a set of equ@@ ations , a set of equ@@ ations <T_4> we can imple@@ ment <T_1> a <T_2> . so <T_6> &apos;s just <T_7> .
<T_7> study <T_6> an <T_2> university found that <T_4> percent <T_3> college fres@@ hmen <T_1> da@@ ma@@ ged hearing as a result <T_0> head@@ phone <T_5> .
on satur@@ day <T_7> twe@@ et@@ ed for this <T_4> and <T_8> , because i <T_0> not want to schle@@ p them from the east coast , and <T_1> showed up <T_9> this <T_5> , <T_3> from new@@ port <T_6> , who <T_2> h@@ ell@@ o .
so , really , this is <T_8> dream <T_0> in a sense what you can think of it is we are <T_4> to enable anyone in the world , i mean anyone <T_3> the world , <T_1> be their own <T_6> d@@ j , creating edu@@ ca@@ tional <T_2> , sharing <T_7> with the world , constantly <T_9> on them . so , this is the <T_5> .
it makes <T_0> adver@@ s@@ ari@@ al . <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_0> the price of <T_1> domin@@ ance is <T_2> .

for example , earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never <T_2> people , but <T_1> of the buildings kill <T_0> .
i think , <T_1> , that <T_4> is a natural <T_0> of the increas@@ ing <T_2> of <T_3> over time .
and <T_2> shows you how <T_0> the control <T_1> .
i <T_3> , <T_9> i also start to <T_5> about some of the <T_2> things <T_7> got wrong , <T_1> of the other <T_6> of <T_8> that i &apos;ve just been assum@@ ing are <T_0> , <T_4> they &apos;re not .

now , that is <T_1> a <T_0> bit hyper@@ bo@@ lic .
and <T_1> the <T_3> is opening up , and <T_2> &apos;s a <T_0> thing .
<T_0> &apos;m <T_2> just an <T_1> , <T_4> &apos;m <T_3> bon@@ a fi@@ de fish ner@@ d .

<T_5> if <T_4> left our <T_2> out , you <T_0> not get a <T_1> billion <T_3> galaxies .

it <T_2> just <T_3> name <T_6> the child , with <T_0> little <T_1> you get to know of somebody that <T_5> meet <T_4> brie@@ fly .
the ti@@ tle of the <T_1> is , &quot; <T_6> the <T_0> said : <T_2> the &apos; 60s <T_4> shaped <T_3> personal computer <T_5> . &quot;
so i <T_1> off <T_3> the <T_7> , as <T_5> people do if they &apos;re going to do research , <T_8> i <T_4> a few <T_6> in <T_2> . <T_0> is <T_9> .
i was <T_1> a <T_8> of mine <T_2> an old <T_6> home , <T_0> i <T_3> a very <T_5> old <T_7> making his way <T_4> the room on a wal@@ ker .
<T_1> it <T_6> &apos;t what <T_0> do , <T_8> &apos;s who <T_7> are . <T_3> say , &quot; but <T_5> is <T_4> , you <T_2> .
and what &apos;s <T_6> about this view is , again , it &apos;s a view <T_5> &apos;s held by pro-@@ glob@@ ali@@ zers like tom <T_8> , from <T_4> book this quote is <T_2> ex@@ cer@@ p@@ ted , but it &apos;s also held <T_7> anti-@@ glob@@ ali@@ zers , who see <T_9> giant glob@@ alization tsunami that &apos;s about to w@@ re@@ ck all our <T_0> if <T_1> hasn &apos;t already <T_3> so .

<T_3> just started asking , &quot; <T_0> did <T_4> buy the <T_1> ? <T_5> much is <T_2> ? &quot;

all over .
but <T_2> that , i decided <T_0> work on the <T_1> .
<T_3> hacker <T_0> break in and change your vote , because then it <T_1> &apos;t <T_4> your <T_2> .
<T_5> i came up with my <T_2> way to <T_1> cells in the <T_3> , and it <T_6> consi@@ sts of dis@@ solving <T_0> brain into <T_4> .
and <T_0> world &apos;s attention <T_9> this over <T_3> last <T_6> has <T_2> the problem for <T_8> women , not by <T_5> the <T_7> , but by <T_4> what they particularly <T_1> out of it .
i <T_0> them <T_1> .
the <T_1> is the <T_0> .
<T_8> ble@@ w <T_0> up to the actual size , and i <T_4> using that , along <T_9> all <T_3> other reference that <T_2> had , compar@@ ing it to it as size reference for <T_7> out exactly how <T_5> the be@@ ak should be , exactly <T_1> long , <T_6> .
again , <T_9> &apos;s <T_4> of the <T_2> that i think <T_7> come through loud and clear <T_0> this conference is : where <T_6> we start ? how <T_1> we <T_8> ? what <T_5> we do <T_3> start ?
<T_2> want to teach me <T_1> my <T_0> .
<T_1> net <T_0> is up .
<T_1> example , molecular <T_0> .
what <T_0> they tell <T_1> ?
so i <T_0> , you know what , i &apos;m <T_2> to start with <T_1> .
it de@@ pri@@ ves <T_0> of its <T_1> .
we <T_2> them <T_0> the <T_1> .

<T_4> you can <T_2> think of many , <T_0> more in <T_3> own everyday <T_1> .
<T_0> also have a <T_2> more ambi@@ gu@@ ous <T_3> with <T_1> .
now , if we look at this , and we stop for <T_3> minute , and we <T_0> about chi@@ ps <T_5> , we <T_6> &apos;t look <T_2> a silicon <T_7> . <T_8> &apos;s <T_4> so <T_1> .
looking <T_4> over <T_7> long <T_9> , <T_1> mo@@ she saf@@ die del@@ ves <T_8> four of his design projects and <T_0> how he <T_6> to make <T_2> one truly <T_3> for its site <T_5> its us@@ ers .

<T_9> &apos;re going to go through a whole <T_1> list , <T_6> crea@@ tivity , and thinking <T_2> exc@@ uses <T_0> to do what <T_5> really <T_3> to do <T_7> you <T_8> to have <T_4> great career .
our <T_1> des@@ er@@ ved a <T_0> way of doing <T_2> .
and so <T_3> i &apos;d <T_2> is what <T_0> call <T_4> service <T_1> .
and <T_7> you bring <T_6> in for <T_5> in your companies , <T_2> thing about the autism , as@@ per@@ ger@@ -@@ y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got <T_1> give them a <T_4> task . <T_0> &apos;t just say , &quot; design <T_3> software . &quot;
and <T_1> all started one day on <T_3> plane , on <T_4> way to <T_0> , seven <T_2> ago .
and <T_3> longer <T_4> could interact <T_0> one of these <T_2> , well that &apos;s indi@@ ca@@ tive , poten@@ tially , of lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term <T_1> .
<T_4> ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment of <T_3> virtu@@ e is ti@@ ed <T_5> the <T_0> of intelle@@ ct <T_1> imagination <T_2> their most challenging .
<T_0> were focused <T_3> your <T_1> . that &apos;s why you were <T_2> .
we went back and looked at <T_0> these particular tex@@ ts <T_4> found , <T_1> it turns <T_5> that they were found very , very far <T_2> the indu@@ s valley <T_3>
<T_2> is <T_0> some guy <T_1> ted .
<T_6> there a risk that <T_4> go to places like africa <T_3> say , we &apos;ve got to fix <T_7> problem and we can do it , <T_5> &apos;ve got all these billions of dollars , you know , da , da , da -- here &apos;s the big <T_9> . and kind of take a much more complex situation <T_2> actually end up making a <T_8> of it . do <T_1> worry <T_0> that ?
<T_5> as <T_6> started to <T_1> , <T_4> don &apos;t <T_3> you &apos;re given <T_2> or f@@ ame <T_0> your own ego , ever .
time <T_7> is <T_4> of how <T_3> , all <T_6> us , divi@@ de the <T_1> of your <T_0> experience <T_2> time zones or <T_5> categ@@ ories .
because if <T_1> look at something <T_2> different wa@@ ve@@ b@@ ands of light , you <T_0> different <T_3> .
so <T_1> is a <T_0> in <T_2> u.s. <T_3> i@@ ke@@ a .
<T_1> year ago <T_0> was in tun@@ is , and i <T_2> the <T_5> of a very <T_3> mosqu@@ e , an <T_4> man .
yeah .
<T_8> was <T_4> so hard and <T_6> emotional <T_1> my <T_5> was f@@ loo@@ ding , <T_0> i was cr@@ ying underwater , <T_3> because <T_7> so <T_2> .
<T_2> the <T_3> , my <T_0> in the <T_1> of <T_4> has been tested .
<T_1> , we have <T_0> al@@ ig@@ ned .
i &apos;ll show you just a <T_3> others . <T_5> we have the numbers <T_2> through <T_4> , <T_1> dig@@ its <T_0> through nine , actually .
chris <T_1> is here <T_2> at his <T_0> cost .
<T_0> can make products that <T_2> beautiful <T_3> u@@ gly , <T_1> or <T_5> , aff@@ ord@@ able <T_6> expensive , func@@ tional <T_4> u@@ sel@@ ess .

but we <T_3> pa@@ dding , and <T_9> sho@@ ck@@ -@@ absor@@ bing things like <T_1> -- the <T_4> that <T_6> us , <T_5> we &apos;re hit <T_8> this , <T_7> to <T_0> ourselves too <T_2> .
ser@@ ge@@ y <T_2> + <T_0> page : the gen@@ esis of <T_1>
<T_3> , <T_4> have actually -- <T_5> looking to turn the <T_2> prize <T_1> a worl@@ d-@@ class prize <T_0> .
<T_5> look at <T_2> other <T_3> revolu@@ tions , and <T_6> case , i &apos;m talking about the <T_1> system , that &apos;s <T_4> , <T_0> &apos;s evolution , and <T_7> plates , that &apos;s we@@ gener .
this <T_6> , actually , <T_4> be on display down in <T_7> sierra <T_0> lo@@ un@@ ge in <T_1> brea@@ ks <T_5> now and the <T_2> of the <T_3> .
it has the <T_0> conditions <T_5> a <T_1> body , 37 <T_2> c@@ enti@@ grade , <T_3> percent <T_4> .
there <T_1> is something <T_0> , but <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> .
she <T_6> to a hundred , even <T_5> . <T_7> along it <T_3> the <T_4> , the <T_0> , but i never , <T_2> now loved <T_1> again .
<T_0> those are great .
it doesn &apos;t <T_2> to <T_0> . so <T_1> don &apos;t like it .
<T_1> amount of <T_5> moder@@ at@@ e-@@ to-@@ sever@@ e snow <T_0> of an <T_3> equivalent to <T_4> size <T_2> california .
<T_0> don &apos;t <T_4> even know <T_3> ja@@ ke is <T_6> about after that , but <T_2> notice <T_5> he &apos;s changing <T_1> top@@ ic .
&quot; <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> bac@@ chan@@ al by <T_0> . &quot;
<T_2> the <T_5> states , we have -- everybody needs <T_3> banking service , <T_0> very few <T_6> us are <T_4> to <T_7> a <T_1> .
you &apos;re <T_0> to <T_4> these , and <T_3> grid is available <T_1> , and we <T_2> to <T_5> it .
in particular , there is <T_6> dou@@ bt <T_3> people <T_0> the <T_7> markets , when people now believe <T_5> democracy is no <T_1> to be <T_4> as a <T_8> for <T_2> growth .
<T_1> how <T_0> you speci@@ alize ?
so , the <T_6> that <T_3> gave you <T_1> is@@ lands of mes@@ h <T_4> , and networks <T_0> interesting only as <T_5> are <T_2> .
the second fal@@ se <T_1> that we make <T_4> we &apos;re <T_7> to <T_0> africa is <T_2> sometimes we <T_3> that <T_9> is something called a government <T_6> africa that car@@ es about <T_5> people , ser@@ ves the interests <T_8> the people , and repres@@ ents the people .
<T_5> we <T_2> back , <T_1> find we must have <T_0> been on top <T_3> each other about <T_6> billion <T_4> ago .
on the right , also , we <T_1> to take into <T_4> the environment of <T_0> planet <T_3> we <T_2> going .
that &apos;s <T_1> only <T_0> the developing world .
<T_2> you <T_3> a big <T_0> meal , <T_1> do you feel ?
<T_6> turns <T_2> that , <T_1> you have <T_0> system , <T_8> stuff happens , <T_7> you in los <T_5> probably know <T_4> better than <T_3> .
<T_3> vi@@ bri@@ os , these <T_2> , <T_1> actually infe@@ ct <T_0> .
<T_0> the up@@ shot of this <T_4> that the mission i want psych@@ ology <T_9> have , in addition to its <T_8> of cur@@ ing the ment@@ ally ill , <T_6> in addition <T_2> its mission of making miser@@ able <T_1> less <T_7> , is <T_3> psych@@ ology actually make people <T_5> ?
<T_0> would be a normal wave <T_1> .
i <T_2> myself <T_0> while i was doing the research <T_1> the <T_3> .
<T_6> either side of us are moun@@ tain <T_1> that are <T_0> than the <T_2> , so <T_3> setting <T_5> is very <T_4> .
what <T_0> that mean ?
<T_8> what he <T_3> was really <T_1> , <T_6> that design <T_4> going to be why <T_5> kids were going to love <T_2> product , <T_7> we were going to make <T_0> low cost , <T_9> .
so <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> 1@@ 30 <T_2> books that <T_0> been <T_1> since the da@@ wn of time .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> going to re@@ place the u.s. <T_2> this <T_0> board .
so the <T_3> are in english , <T_6> journ@@ als <T_0> done in <T_4> , <T_5> that <T_2> a self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling <T_1> .
<T_0> are we doing <T_2> all the <T_1> of those nuclear wea@@ po@@ ns ?
so i would like <T_1> in@@ vi@@ te you from whatever <T_3> you &apos;re from to join <T_5> in rein@@ v@@ ent@@ ing and rei@@ mag@@ ining the <T_7> , <T_2> things come together <T_4> the nano@@ scale to the <T_9> scale , so that we can go from <T_0> world like this <T_6> a <T_8> that &apos;s more like this .
the <T_0> sty@@ les <T_1> &apos;t change that much .
<T_6> , <T_1> five , <T_0> , <T_3> , <T_7> ! <T_2> &apos;m a designer , that &apos;s <T_5> , of <T_4> gif@@ ts .
this <T_2> one piece <T_0> good <T_1> .
<T_3> changed <T_1> name <T_2> vi@@ vian because <T_0> wanted to fit in here in america .
<T_0> has <T_2> years <T_1> live .
<T_1> &apos;ve talked about <T_0> and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk <T_2> health .
<T_2> much li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck do you <T_0> to produce <T_1> ?
<T_3> don &apos;t really think of myself <T_0> a designer , <T_4> don &apos;t really think of <T_2> necessarily as a <T_1> .
<T_3> many <T_1> you here <T_0> over the age of <T_2> ?
why don &apos;t i just start by <T_1> away with <T_0> video ?
<T_2> -- you <T_1> the <T_0> at the bottom ?
<T_3> i <T_4> , &quot; <T_2> ? &quot; <T_5> she <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;re going to get depres@@ sed . &quot;
<T_7> is like <T_4> . <T_3> &apos;s a time of <T_2> , when <T_8> turns to <T_0> , <T_1> turns to <T_6> , <T_5> then it all disappe@@ ars .
and if <T_1> give both of them <T_0> for the <T_6> , <T_7> two <T_2> si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , they &apos;re <T_4> willing to <T_3> this 25 times in a <T_5> .
<T_4> this is what <T_0> without <T_3> partner , <T_2> there &apos;s no <T_1> sitting there .
at the other <T_1> of the scale , <T_7> game <T_5> that you <T_3> well have heard of , has 70 <T_9> pla@@ yers around the <T_0> and most of <T_2> pla@@ yers are <T_6> it <T_8> every <T_4> .
so , in conclusion , i &apos;m <T_4> to show you an <T_3> that <T_2> shows you how <T_1> or@@ bits have been moving , in three <T_0> .
<T_0> mean that <T_1> sky .
<T_5> le@@ ver@@ ages millions <T_1> years of evolution <T_4> re@@ designing <T_2> to <T_0> really <T_3> products .
so i <T_4> you to <T_0> a world <T_1> better <T_9> quality , <T_7> quality <T_3> life and <T_5> quality of living <T_6> everyone including <T_2> future <T_8> .
<T_1> allowed for <T_0> ob@@ stac@@ les .
i <T_2> &apos;t want to write <T_0> this <T_1> audience .
mr. smo@@ key <T_0> , let &apos;s take it for a walk . come on , <T_1> .
now , you &apos;ve heard about this <T_1> terms <T_0> nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology .
and <T_3> made them re@@ act <T_4> people , but we <T_0> that <T_1> were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful <T_2> child@@ like with <T_5> .
and you <T_0> see how many <T_2> it <T_1> .
<T_4> the <T_0> is <T_5> expensive <T_1> it &apos;s co@@ st-@@ pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tive <T_3> many <T_2> around the glo@@ be .
right ?
they &apos;re looking for <T_2> to <T_0> . <T_3> it <T_1> here they &apos;ll bre@@ ed .
you <T_0> come back <T_1> earth .
<T_1> &apos;s ideas <T_0> darwin &apos;s ideas <T_2> be bl@@ ended <T_3> .
<T_1> were <T_0> suffering .
<T_3> used to say that , &quot; <T_0> only <T_2> are <T_5> legs . <T_4> only trust <T_1> legs . &quot;
so <T_1> &apos;s what <T_0> is all about .
<T_0> : what do they want <T_2> come here for <T_1> ?
<T_0> you bur@@ n off <T_2> ha@@ agen@@ -@@ da@@ z@@ s <T_3> the <T_1> before ?
and in <T_3> middle of the recor@@ ding , the mi@@ cs pick this up , <T_4> later in the <T_8> , <T_1> kid shows up , and he <T_5> using <T_9> line at the top of <T_7> park to do some very advan@@ ced <T_6> on something called <T_0> t@@ all <T_2> .
so we <T_6> the <T_2> that are provi@@ ding the <T_0> and the <T_5> , and <T_1> company that &apos;s doing <T_3> stuff that <T_4> do .
<T_3> know , <T_4> is <T_5> -- i &apos;m <T_1> being <T_0> what inspired <T_2> to <T_6> on all this .
he <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> must <T_2> . &quot;
and you &apos;ve got trilli@@ ons of them .
so we &apos;re creating <T_1> own <T_0> and so on .
once i was <T_1> new <T_3> and got <T_2> a <T_5> . <T_0> took <T_4> back@@ seat , and in front of <T_6> i saw <T_8> related <T_7> a play .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> design <T_0> manufac@@ ture question .
and i <T_5> you to hold <T_9> there , just for a <T_2> , <T_1> i only want you to allow <T_0> hand to sin@@ k and dri@@ ft and flo@@ at back to the tab@@ le@@ top at the same <T_6> as you dri@@ ft and flo@@ at <T_8> this <T_3> state of awareness , and allow it to go all the <T_4> down to the tab@@ le@@ top . <T_7>
<T_0> liked <T_1> take things <T_2> .
<T_0> wit@@ n@@ essed <T_1> technical diffic@@ ul@@ ty .
<T_2> now we <T_0> to my <T_1> .
<T_1> all the eastern <T_0> except japan <T_3> the same <T_2> .
and there &apos;s about <T_1> million people in migra@@ tion <T_5> to get into urban cen@@ ters at all <T_6> , and <T_8> the next <T_4> to <T_7> years , are <T_9> another 400 <T_2> 500 <T_3> people to migra@@ te into the urban cen@@ ters like shanghai <T_0> the manufactur@@ ing cen@@ ters .
i &apos;m <T_1> a <T_3> . i &apos;m <T_2> a <T_0> .
<T_1> you have any <T_4> about <T_0> technology <T_3> our lives , you <T_2> have to go to any <T_5> .
<T_3> &apos;re <T_0> to give you one as your <T_1> to take <T_2> .
we &apos;re <T_2> 10 billion <T_1> on the <T_0> .
al-@@ qaeda is taking over <T_0> terri@@ tor@@ ies .
so <T_0> know at <T_2> you &apos;re <T_1> to have a chan@@ ge-@@ the-@@ world kind of <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> poly@@ mathematical website .
what <T_3> &apos;m <T_0> to do is open up a <T_1> that i <T_2> .
<T_2> again <T_0> the course of <T_1> hours .
they &apos;re <T_3> having , at <T_2> very <T_4> , a <T_1> spa@@ w@@ ning season <T_0> year .
thank you .
<T_0> gets <T_1> .
<T_0> do <T_1> do ?
now , this isn &apos;t going <T_1> be <T_0> .
you <T_0> increasingly that the <T_1> now looks actually , <T_2> us <T_6> , much more <T_5> europe <T_3> the 19@@ th <T_4> .
but in <T_8> , if you re@@ ver@@ sed <T_0> figure ground -- in <T_9> words , the <T_1> areas here -- i for@@ got to ask for a poin@@ ter -- <T_7> if you <T_6> it , you &apos;ll see a whole series of little <T_5> . by the way , if you &apos;re also a student at cal@@ tech -- they also tend <T_4> just see the <T_2> . it &apos;s based <T_3> experience .
so , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> friend <T_0> .
<T_0> is the final , <T_5> i <T_7> most beautiful <T_8> , of howard <T_2> : that in embra@@ cing <T_4> diversity of <T_3> beings , <T_9> will find a <T_1> way to true <T_6> .

the <T_1> building <T_0> basically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te for doing private work .
and <T_0> is the <T_1> you see .
<T_2> many <T_1> think this is <T_4> , <T_0> beautiful , <T_3> this is your <T_5> .
in this respect , <T_7> members <T_9> society , there is no <T_8> honor or <T_4> than facili@@ tat@@ ing that process of <T_0> for someone , to bear witness , <T_6> reach out a hand , <T_3> share <T_2> bur@@ den of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold <T_1> hope <T_5> their re@@ co@@ very .
<T_7> for those <T_6> you <T_2> love the <T_1> , <T_4> &apos;t you <T_5> you inv@@ ited me <T_0> to bri@@ gh@@ ten <T_3> day ?
<T_1> want them to be <T_0> of that .
it &apos;s for this reason that the global com@@ mission <T_6> hiv <T_4> the law , of <T_9> i &apos;m a me@@ mber , was estab@@ li@@ shed <T_5> the agen@@ cies of the united nations -- to look at the <T_3> that legal <T_0> are affe@@ cting people living <T_8> hiv and those at greatest risk , and to <T_1> what should be done to make <T_7> law an ally , not an enemy , <T_2> the global response to hiv .
tell <T_2> something , <T_3> you think it was quick when you <T_0> saw <T_4> ? yes <T_1> did .
<T_3> : this is what <T_2> to the <T_4> in <T_0> who are <T_1> up .
we <T_1> they <T_3> through ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned <T_2> and <T_0> .
the <T_1> is , we <T_0> &apos;t know .
how do you <T_1> that <T_0> ?
<T_2> cour@@ t <T_1> often conc@@ ern an alle@@ ge@@ dly <T_0> version <T_3> crea@@ tion@@ ism , called &quot; <T_4> design , &quot; or <T_5> .
and <T_3> , i was able to put <T_4> into <T_1> story , which is <T_2> alphabet , <T_5> hopefully go on to <T_0> else .
i was <T_9> -- so , the <T_6> that we create <T_7> fal@@ se -- this <T_5> of com@@ plac@@ ency <T_4> all <T_3> do is talk about somebody else &apos;s <T_8> as though <T_1> &apos;s our <T_2> , and <T_0> .
one is <T_9> research shows <T_0> once you <T_4> all of your material needs <T_6> care of -- <T_5> most <T_7> us , all of us , here in this room do -- <T_8> shows that there are very <T_3> things in <T_1> that can <T_2> el@@ ev@@ ate your level of happiness .
<T_0> it inclu@@ des <T_1> fis@@ hes <T_2> well .
<T_2> can be liber@@ ating , <T_5> when it is <T_0> , <T_3> become permanent <T_4> without <T_1> .
so , i <T_2> , &quot; <T_3> well <T_4> can &apos;t <T_5> that . then we <T_0> do <T_1> harder . &quot;
in the old <T_1> , it was <T_2> kni@@ fe <T_0> a <T_3> .
and then , <T_1> , a <T_0> that will set the level of the stimu@@ lation , which is the level <T_2> says you are having a heart <T_3> .
<T_3> hope that that <T_2> this <T_1> you &apos;ll be <T_0> that .
how we <T_8> lives on in <T_0> minds of everybody who survi@@ ves us , and <T_5> stress created in families by dying <T_2> enormous , and in fact you get <T_3> times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere <T_7> , so dying in intensive care is <T_6> your <T_9> option if <T_4> &apos;ve got a <T_1> .

so for example , this s@@ ally person says , &quot; so <T_8> need to find <T_0> to ch@@ ill with &quot; and <T_4> says , &quot; <T_2> &quot; -- <T_9> could <T_1> a dis@@ ser@@ tation <T_6> &quot; <T_7> &quot; too , but we <T_3> &apos;t have time for that — &quot; <T_5> so you &apos;re going by yourself ? why ? &quot;

<T_0> don &apos;t need something <T_1> to <T_2> something more .
and <T_0> &apos;s been <T_1> exciting .
you <T_1> see it at a gross level <T_0> the world of d@@ ating .
and some of <T_7> animals <T_0> probably inspiration <T_3> the things you saw <T_6> &quot; <T_8> , &quot; <T_1> you don &apos;t have <T_4> travel <T_5> p@@ and@@ ora <T_2> see them .

<T_2> imagine that <T_6> will soon <T_1> able to look <T_5> your brain <T_0> sele@@ ct <T_3> areas to do that same <T_4> .
after i <T_5> from the yale law school <T_8> got my <T_1> law job , my new <T_9> analy@@ st , dr. <T_7> , announ@@ ced to me that <T_2> was going to close <T_4> practice in three months , <T_3> years before <T_6> had plan@@ ned to <T_0> new haven .
so we stopped <T_2> ship , <T_1> you <T_0> .
<T_5> so , <T_2> was really those <T_4> that made <T_3> decide to build <T_6> f@@ und <T_0> six <T_1> ago .
you can find spi@@ ders <T_0> nearly <T_1> ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al <T_2> .
i <T_1> a young <T_0> out on the <T_3> , and <T_2> car in <T_5> of me , i saw the <T_4> lights go on .
<T_5> i <T_3> a <T_4> br@@ us@@ h <T_1> conver@@ gen@@ ce until , kind of , war@@ ner <T_2> has to li@@ qui@@ date the <T_0> thing .
and <T_4> you look <T_2> the <T_1> and you <T_3> meas@@ uring what comes <T_0> .
so we <T_1> have a <T_2> idea , but we &apos;re afraid <T_0> share it with <T_3> else .
<T_1> i would have lost <T_0> face .
<T_0> would <T_1> hear <T_2> sound .
so first i <T_0> with the <T_1> .
<T_4> : but we truly do <T_0> day and <T_3> trying to <T_1> unique <T_2> .
<T_2> can call yourself <T_0> , <T_3> responsibility <T_1> accoun@@ t@@ ability <T_4> doesn &apos;t work .

<T_1> fact , they <T_0> be du@@ e to the very nature of <T_2> evolutionary history .

and we <T_1> that <T_4> out of the <T_7> 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ b@@ ase <T_8> pieces <T_0> synthesi@@ zed were <T_2> accurate and <T_5> with <T_3> life@@ -@@ forming <T_6> .
so <T_4> , all <T_3> a sudden , we &apos;re looking at <T_1> map of <T_0> human <T_2> .
you know , a <T_1> was once watching <T_0> present@@ ation i was doing , when <T_4> was working with <T_3> young <T_2> .
<T_0> is the <T_1> we have , isn &apos;t it .
very quickly : <T_7> wasn &apos;t quite <T_9> how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a <T_6> quote from the &quot; japanese es@@ says on <T_0> &quot; <T_8> said it &apos;s nice to have something which <T_1> un@@ finished <T_3> it <T_4> there <T_5> still <T_2> for growth .
<T_0> this .
<T_3> society <T_8> to <T_4> the idea of the single , <T_0> invent@@ or who , working <T_7> in the <T_1> one <T_6> , makes an earth@@ sha@@ king <T_5> , <T_9> vo@@ il@@ a , <T_2> everything &apos;s changed .
and <T_0> said , &quot; well , you <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;s the <T_3> . &quot;
<T_2> right now , i <T_7> more like <T_6> are <T_3> principles , and <T_1> you <T_5> &apos;t like <T_4> , i <T_0> others .
the <T_1> , <T_2> offic@@ ers , were <T_0> efficient .
<T_2> june , <T_1> world health organization dec@@ lar@@ ed <T_0> first <T_3> flu pande@@ mic in 4@@ 1 <T_4> .
today , i &apos;m using <T_5> to create <T_0> , <T_7> , vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous <T_6> the <T_2> of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged <T_3> in <T_4> around <T_1> world .
and <T_0> , <T_2> launched our <T_1> t@@ 20 leagu@@ e .
this is -- we have <T_7> fair@@ ly complex <T_2> that , you know , <T_8> and musi@@ cians and <T_3> on , but <T_6> we &apos;re all <T_4> , <T_1> know that <T_5> e@@ ar <T_9> the final <T_0> .
and you know , val@@ ve -- you <T_7> , port@@ al -- is <T_3> example of <T_8> video game in which you have <T_9> certain type of <T_2> which also <T_0> me <T_6> talk about one of the biggest issues <T_4> we had to discuss when we ac@@ qui@@ red the <T_1> , what to do <T_5> violence .
<T_4> walk <T_3> to your local school <T_0> consu@@ lt with <T_2> teachers . they <T_5> always <T_6> you how <T_1> help .
but actually <T_0> did .
that the co2 <T_1> , the climate problem that we &apos;ve heard about , is driving lots of things -- innova@@ tions <T_9> the energy <T_2> that <T_6> reduce <T_4> -- but also , i <T_8> , in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , it will drive <T_7> towards thinking about climate <T_3> wea@@ ther control , whether we like <T_0> or <T_5> .
the <T_5> of a new ze@@ al@@ and <T_0> who was just down <T_3> is reporting <T_7> significant dec@@ line in <T_9> number of the ross sea <T_4> whales , who <T_8> directly <T_6> on the antar@@ c@@ tic <T_1> as their <T_2> source of food .
<T_1> you picture , <T_5> some point , live , <T_6> real time , you could have <T_4> kind <T_7> conversation , inv@@ iting <T_8> , <T_9> with <T_2> from china <T_3> india <T_0> in ?
i think <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> very dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting notion , this idea that <T_2> cars will be <T_0> us , <T_7> about us <T_1> other <T_8> , <T_9> we &apos;ll be going down the road in <T_3> sea <T_6> go@@ ssi@@ p .
<T_0> sometimes , <T_2> &apos;s not <T_1> case .
environmental <T_2> , in <T_1> ways , put us <T_3> in the <T_0> boat .
when <T_3> used this <T_2> e@@ e@@ g <T_0> to actually look <T_1> ju@@ stin &apos;s brain , the <T_4> were star@@ tling .
<T_1> at that central <T_5> right in <T_6> middle <T_2> the picture : <T_8> &apos;s <T_0> 13@@ 0-@@ foot <T_7> , that <T_3> exactly <T_4> size of the b@@ ase of the spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p .
they <T_0> .
we &apos;d have a water <T_4> system treating waste@@ water , turning that into <T_1> water <T_5> gener@@ ating <T_6> from <T_0> soli@@ ds using <T_2> plants <T_3> micro@@ -@@ organisms .
<T_0> we <T_1> get <T_9> of that , then <T_4> high@@ ways will now be <T_6> to <T_8> , <T_7> contra@@ sted <T_5> what &apos;s happening in <T_2> parts of the <T_3> today .
so i find myself <T_0> : <T_1> is music <T_2> all of this ?
but <T_2> does anyone have <T_0> feel <T_1> ?
<T_0> is when we see the <T_2> of the trans@@ national <T_3> al <T_1> .
<T_5> &apos;s one <T_3> these rare cases <T_2> the u.s. is actually <T_6> better than &#91; the u.k. &#93; , <T_4> we <T_0> like <T_8> your media , <T_7> than <T_1> .
and <T_0> these companies , they build <T_1> .
and <T_3> &apos;s put it back <T_1> the <T_6> , <T_2> in <T_0> middle , <T_5> let &apos;s get <T_4> .
we don &apos;t know the <T_0> of the <T_2> , <T_3> ment@@ ally <T_1> .
now , <T_1> &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in total isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is -- that &apos;s another part of the <T_7> . come talk to me <T_9> it , we &apos;ll fill in some of the <T_8> -- but there &apos;s a very important <T_3> here : <T_2> is 200 years of history , and <T_6> 200 <T_0> we &apos;ve been syste@@ matically <T_5> our <T_4> system .
and it then became obvious from me that <T_7> had to move away from <T_0> classi@@ cal <T_9> paradigm , <T_6> on <T_4> tre@@ ad@@ mil@@ l , and <T_8> conditions <T_2> would encourage the <T_1> to begin volun@@ tary <T_5> over the <T_3> .
however , recently <T_6> ris@@ d opportunity kind <T_1> aro@@ se -- going <T_2> ris@@ d -- and <T_3> couldn &apos;t re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this real <T_5> , <T_4> the letters <T_0> told <T_8> , <T_7> forever .
you need 20 interests , and then one of <T_9> , <T_4> of them <T_3> grab you , <T_1> of them <T_7> engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found <T_0> greatest love in <T_2> to all the <T_6> things that interest you , <T_8> that &apos;s what <T_5> is .
<T_1> , &quot; by the way , <T_3> guy &apos;s <T_0> cra@@ pp@@ y <T_2> . &quot;
we <T_1> to deal with them with <T_2> and <T_0> them .
<T_4> i <T_1> you earlier <T_2> we may want to emplo@@ y <T_5> of robots to <T_6> <T_3> limit@@ ations of <T_0> .

i <T_4> &apos;t even known that there were rain@@ forests in the <T_5> , <T_0> in great <T_7> mountains <T_8> it <T_6> rain up <T_3> 100 <T_1> of rain <T_2> year .
but <T_5> think that ei@@ le@@ en expres@@ ses <T_4> what <T_6> really get out of <T_2> , <T_3> is the <T_0> joy <T_1> collabor@@ ation .
and <T_2> think some <T_5> you may have <T_6> -- <T_1> farmers are helped <T_3> ki@@ ck@@ start and <T_4> , <T_0> help them become more self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent .
and <T_0> means <T_1> complete <T_5> of coming from <T_3> , <T_2> to <T_6> physical , <T_4> someone per@@ cei@@ ving it .
<T_2> do <T_1> struggle with it so <T_0> ?

you <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;s a <T_0> interesting passage <T_5> a book by <T_1> co@@ hen , the <T_4> histor@@ ian .
there are too many of us outside and everybody , just to <T_9> a bit from hans -- hans rosling , he &apos;s my <T_8> -- <T_2> the <T_6> of the text repres@@ ents what gets the most attention , it &apos;s the <T_3> . but what we really <T_1> are african <T_4> that are appropri@@ ate for <T_0> -- looking at the <T_5> , looking at the people , looking at how much <T_7> they &apos;ve got .
<T_4> was a <T_3> bran@@ ch gra@@ fted onto <T_7> different <T_2> tree , <T_6> , not because <T_1> parents op@@ ted for <T_0> different <T_5> .
once <T_2> a time , <T_1> was used as ba@@ it in dog <T_0> .
so , <T_7> i <T_6> to look at those <T_5> , i <T_0> that since <T_1> late <T_3> a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving <T_2> united <T_4> , never to <T_8> back .

<T_0> &apos;s another hu@@ b in london , now , and the rest are getting <T_3> up . we <T_1> to give the <T_2> away <T_8> some stage . <T_7> &apos;s <T_9> complicated <T_5> about making <T_6> available to the <T_4> of the world .
<T_2> beha@@ ved just <T_1> the <T_0> .
<T_1> yeah , all the <T_0> in the audience <T_6> talk about <T_2> and all <T_4> standard <T_5> . we &apos;ll do that <T_3> .

<T_1> was <T_0> up@@ set .
my name <T_1> ur@@ sus <T_0> , <T_3> i would like to talk to <T_6> this <T_5> about my <T_4> , ti@@ dying up <T_2> .
now here <T_0> live images being <T_1> straight from <T_2> feed .
<T_2> the obvious thing to look at <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_1> now you &apos;ve got to <T_0> .
<T_1> deep@@ er <T_2> go , the lo@@ op@@ ier <T_0> get .
when <T_1> take education and technology , then i find in <T_2> liter@@ ature that , you know , things like <T_4> , collabor@@ ative environ@@ ments -- you &apos;ve <T_3> listening to all that in the morning -- <T_6> &apos;s always pil@@ oted first in <T_5> best <T_7> , <T_0> best urban <T_8> , and , according <T_9> me , bi@@ ases the result .
<T_3> i can <T_1> you -- <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> an ol@@ den@@ bur@@ g .
once <T_2> get to camp <T_0> , you have <T_4> 24 <T_5> to decide <T_6> you &apos;re going to go for <T_3> sum@@ mit <T_1> not .

ultimately , the <T_4> , once <T_9> understand how these <T_3> effects can change <T_0> decision making , we <T_2> to be able to provide <T_8> tools so that <T_6> can consci@@ ously make themselves <T_5> sa@@ vers <T_7> more conscious investor@@ s <T_1> their own future .

i &apos;m <T_3> very <T_5> that <T_1> the <T_8> decades , we will make big <T_2> on <T_6> that <T_4> rate that has been so challenging <T_7> this <T_0> .
<T_2> : death <T_1> catch you <T_4> , <T_3> , <T_0> at the organic .
<T_4> zones <T_7> de@@ di@@ cated <T_8> lan@@ es are going to be created , and all of <T_0> will cut down the <T_1> rush hour com@@ mu@@ te to get <T_5> town <T_6> new york <T_3> about an hour today at rush hour <T_9> about <T_2> minutes .

and <T_2> answer to that <T_0> &quot; yes , &quot; <T_3> this is what we &apos;re doing <T_1> .
<T_1> circle around fla@@ gs , and then <T_0> can <T_2> each other .
and <T_8> see <T_1> structures , <T_3> thing <T_4> call the great wall , <T_9> there <T_7> vo@@ i@@ ds and <T_0> kinds of stuff , and they kind of <T_2> out because the <T_6> isn &apos;t sensi@@ tive enough to <T_5> it .
and <T_6> cell <T_0> actually manufac@@ ture the <T_2> that it needs on the <T_7> , <T_5> information that &apos;s brought <T_3> the <T_4> that read the <T_1> .
he would <T_1> the entire <T_0> of being scan@@ ned .
<T_1> you have a <T_0> , it <T_2> five <T_3> to make it .
so <T_7> walked <T_3> my room one evening , and he sat on the <T_1> of my <T_8> , and he <T_6> , &quot; j@@ ar@@ re@@ tt , it &apos;s up <T_4> you , <T_0> if <T_5> &apos;d like to , we &apos;d like to send <T_9> to the clas@@ ses at the <T_2> art museum . &quot;
let me give <T_2> an <T_3> of what i mean by <T_0> but tab@@ o@@ o <T_1> . we <T_4> them scen@@ ari@@ os <T_5>
and this <T_6> actually <T_2> field <T_5> mathematics that under@@ lies <T_0> rela@@ tivity <T_4> is actually <T_3> going to show us about <T_7> shape of <T_1> universe .

&apos;@@ i &apos;m being pus@@ hed <T_0> a <T_2> . <T_3> situation <T_1> gra@@ ve , &apos; <T_4> mo@@ an .
first , i went <T_3> mit , <T_9> ai lab was <T_5> , <T_8> i said , well , i <T_7> to build <T_2> machines , too , but the way i <T_4> to do it is <T_1> study <T_6> brains <T_0> first .
<T_3> &apos;s com@@ posed of <T_4> sub@@ units : <T_2> , <T_1> , g <T_0> t , we call them .
you <T_2> from <T_1> mistakes , and you <T_0> improve .

please enjoy .
but that &apos;s <T_2> irre@@ versi@@ ble , and <T_0> could be <T_1> .
we <T_5> to <T_0> the pollu@@ tion , we <T_4> to solve the <T_6> -- but <T_3> &apos;s not what <T_7> me <T_2> this <T_1> .
since <T_3> had <T_2> been separ@@ ated , <T_5> i <T_8> we <T_6> be together <T_4> , <T_7> didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g <T_0> she <T_1> .

i mean , certainly <T_0> did . this <T_1> one <T_2> .
that &apos;s why i <T_1> that <T_2> is a <T_0> break .
<T_0> in the <T_1> is <T_4> simple . even <T_2> life is <T_3> .

let me <T_1> you a <T_0> of what <T_2> does to the <T_3> .
<T_3> we &apos;re doing <T_1> , this <T_2> what <T_0> .
and <T_1> can see , it &apos;s l@@ um@@ p@@ y <T_0> .
<T_4> , contr@@ ary to <T_0> belief , there <T_2> not a conflict of <T_3> between em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ism and <T_1> .

<T_0> that may not be <T_2> that &apos;s going <T_1> .
<T_3> wer@@ ni@@ cke <T_7> every tedtalk <T_1> be <T_8> in <T_6> words . <T_2> this talk , <T_9> shows <T_5> to do just <T_0> -- <T_4> less . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

<T_0> that goes beyond <T_3> we know in <T_1> e@@ go@@ -@@ bo@@ und <T_2> .
<T_0> you have things that <T_3> cheap <T_5> , <T_4> will <T_7> uses for them , <T_1> if <T_6> seem very <T_2> .
<T_0> i &apos;ve got <T_1> live demonstration over <T_4> to <T_2> this <T_3> you .

<T_6> that pro@@ mp@@ ted <T_8> to make maps like this , with <T_1> kinds of <T_9> detail <T_0> the land , but when you get to the waters <T_7> , <T_3> ocean looks <T_2> one <T_4> pu@@ ddle <T_5> blue paint .
in fact , <T_3> &apos;s extremely <T_2> , and <T_1> body uses a <T_0> of them .
wouldn &apos;t it <T_2> great if <T_3> could actually har@@ ness the <T_1> of our <T_4> , to actually he@@ al <T_0> ?
<T_2> time you think <T_0> a <T_3> , you &apos;ve got to <T_1> green .
<T_2> think <T_5> simon <T_4> in the <T_1> , <T_9> he <T_3> -- he <T_0> not realize it , <T_7> he wrote <T_6> song all <T_8> whale sex , &quot; sli@@ p-@@ sli@@ d@@ in &apos; away . &quot;
the <T_4> we see <T_3> is <T_1> for our <T_0> , and therefore we love <T_2> .

we &apos;d <T_0> better give you <T_2> longer sound <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> can &apos;t really <T_0> sense the <T_2> around you .
<T_4> i <T_0> , the ro@@ ots <T_6> the way <T_2> sort of thought <T_7> just the <T_1> natural <T_5> to think <T_3> things .
<T_0> love ...
and <T_1> took <T_0> driving less@@ on , and i <T_5> , &quot; <T_2> &apos;m going to learn <T_3> to <T_4> . &quot;
and <T_1> we are hit@@ ting <T_2> limits <T_0> multiple fron@@ ts .
so many , many useful <T_0> come out of <T_1> .
secon@@ dly <T_0> need skills , the <T_2> skills of the <T_1> .
the <T_7> , <T_3> we see <T_5> , has to <T_1> with <T_9> single , simple word : &quot; <T_2> , &quot; <T_0> a single , simple <T_4> : &quot; <T_8> world <T_6> . &quot;
<T_2> &apos;re not supposed to , <T_0> they <T_1> out a <T_3> .
and <T_0> map <T_1> actually <T_2> little bit bigger .
and you &apos;ve got to start <T_1> a word that &apos;s called &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
it <T_0> a <T_1> im@@ pulse that <T_3> galaxies <T_2> from each other .
<T_3> years ago , in <T_1> , in great britain , there was a long <T_0> over economy <T_2> mor@@ ality .
so with <T_0> an@@ at@@ o@@ mage table , <T_2> can experience the dis@@ se@@ ction <T_3> a human <T_1> .
so <T_4> we <T_6> to recognize is <T_3> if <T_5> want to have a citi@@ z@@ en-@@ cent@@ ric internet <T_2> the <T_7> , <T_1> need a <T_0> and more susta@@ ined internet freedom movement .
<T_5> , <T_4> got some <T_7> to <T_6> this <T_1> out <T_8> see <T_0> these results <T_2> replic@@ able , if they <T_3> everywhere else .
<T_8> &apos;s just <T_9> this <T_3> , <T_0> wor@@ th@@ less , in which it alle@@ ge@@ dly worked by &quot; electro@@ sta@@ tic magnetic <T_6> attra@@ ction , &quot; which transl@@ ates to &quot; <T_2> bal@@ on@@ ey &quot; -- would be the nice <T_5> -- <T_1> which you str@@ ing together a bunch of words that sound <T_7> , but it does <T_4> nothing .
<T_0> galaxies were <T_2> away from <T_1> .
<T_2> py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , if we ja@@ m <T_1> in the bottom , can get <T_3> up like <T_0> se@@ wer line that &apos;s <T_4> .
we &apos;re also looking at <T_3> of the <T_9> , <T_6> in just <T_0> terms in our modern <T_2> of destroy the other or <T_1> them to the ground , but really to <T_8> together and build <T_4> and have <T_5> that is <T_7> .
it still <T_0> up at half <T_1> turn .
take nothing : do no <T_0> .
<T_2> it <T_1> really <T_0> at some point .

there &apos;s a fish <T_0> here .
thanks .
but <T_0> basically want <T_1> diversity of activi@@ ties the <T_2> can play through this .
but the <T_0> question was , <T_1> ?
<T_5> is <T_6> cli@@ p from <T_4> video , from <T_0> piece of anima@@ tion that was <T_3> by <T_7> writer in hollywood , anima@@ tion worked out <T_9> isra@@ el , far@@ med out to cro@@ a@@ ti@@ a and <T_8> , <T_1> it &apos;s now an <T_2> series .
here &apos;s what <T_5> : <T_2> &apos;re all <T_0> . everyone &apos;s <T_3> . a <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> .
<T_2> , <T_1> haven &apos;t met these particular <T_3> , but i &apos;ve <T_4> students like <T_0> .
instead , all they <T_0> to do is look up <T_1> the list <T_2> kind <T_4> sent@@ ence goes <T_3> what kind <T_5> crime .
they colle@@ ctively <T_0> every one of <T_1> categ@@ ories and <T_2> from over 80 <T_3> .
<T_6> ban@@ ks -- <T_5> ban@@ ks are <T_3> con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated , <T_1> that <T_7> of the banking system has attra@@ cted <T_0> lot of <T_2> from <T_4> .
<T_4> , <T_5> sugge@@ sti@@ on <T_3> the <T_6> working <T_1> networks : <T_7> are able to give you good <T_0> about <T_2> to evol@@ ve networks .
<T_1> had <T_0> to satellite ima@@ gery .
why <T_0> learn to <T_1> down ? &quot;
<T_5> , ar@@ med <T_3> all the <T_0> of <T_1> year <T_7> , <T_4> decided <T_2> wanted to do cancer research at <T_6> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_3> un@@ common <T_2> a <T_1> video to have multiple <T_0> ow@@ ners .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_5> syste@@ m@@ s-@@ level look <T_3> how <T_4> is admini@@ ster@@ ed <T_2> what is being off@@ ered and to <T_1> .
what <T_6> mean by that , and let me <T_5> this example , the country of <T_2> , because i <T_3> just there <T_8> therefore <T_1> &apos;m a little <T_0> familiar with <T_9> of the challenges <T_4> have <T_7>
if <T_1> test them , <T_3> four will get the <T_0> sc@@ or@@ es in <T_2> you <T_4> them .
the <T_4> , <T_5> , that <T_2> the <T_0> , has licen@@ sed <T_3> intelle@@ ctu@@ al proper@@ ty to the medi@@ cin@@ es patent <T_1> .
but <T_2> really says this <T_0> of inter@@ activity -- which was so <T_5> and cap@@ tures the <T_6> , the web zeit@@ geist <T_3> 1995 -- than &quot; click <T_1> for <T_4> picture of my <T_7> . &quot;
<T_2> , <T_1> have a whole bunch of dis@@ par@@ ate <T_0> .
so that <T_0> &apos;t going to work .
<T_2> had discovered <T_5> all <T_3> the <T_0> he thought <T_1> this was <T_4> that .
i <T_1> &apos;t believe that it was possible for <T_2> to live any <T_3> , <T_4> i started to be attac@@ ked by <T_0> own sta@@ phy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus .
and so <T_1> has basically <T_0> chan@@ n@@ els .
so we <T_1> about p@@ mt@@ ct , and we <T_3> to p@@ mt@@ ct , pre@@ vention <T_2> mother <T_0> child trans@@ mission .
so <T_2> is , as <T_7> moun@@ t@@ ford <T_1> said , &quot; <T_4> mouse is <T_3> the nar@@ ro@@ west <T_0> you could try <T_6> su@@ ck all of <T_5> expression <T_8> . &quot;
or you <T_3> tag facebook photos with the <T_2> that <T_0> had associated with <T_5> memories <T_6> then <T_1> pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze the <T_7> that catch <T_4> attention , just like <T_8> .
i expect <T_2> and joy <T_1> family <T_0> community .
<T_1> : oh my <T_0> !
and one of the <T_0> things <T_2> this <T_1> was that <T_7> was <T_4> , virtu@@ ally <T_3> , and was <T_5> easy <T_6> use .
i had <T_0> mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of <T_2> the <T_1> , <T_3> i <T_4> flexible hours .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_3> this to <T_4> air now with a gr@@ ant <T_1> the slo@@ an <T_2> .
so <T_2> &apos;s right up <T_1> the <T_0> .

<T_1> suddenly , the <T_0> took off . it took flight .
the <T_0> thing about this <T_2> is <T_3> &apos;s not that <T_1> .
<T_5> up to <T_4> , me <T_1> my father were deta@@ ched <T_2> i <T_3> have issues with <T_0> .
and we &apos;re starting <T_0> june . so <T_2> is <T_1> mon@@ soon rain .

there &apos;s one more , <T_0> think , wonderful <T_1> to <T_2> tale .

<T_2> you <T_1> see the start <T_0> it here .
<T_1> have to design <T_2> artificial <T_3> for <T_0> conditions .
<T_3> can <T_0> money , you can <T_2> money <T_1> africa .
what <T_0> is driving <T_4> galaxies to <T_2> away from <T_5> other <T_1> an ever@@ -@@ quick@@ ening <T_3> ?

<T_0> , <T_3> &apos;re <T_4> coming in from the back <T_1> ; <T_5> &apos;re still <T_2> in .
so <T_1> is <T_0> turning point .

go <T_1> and <T_0> it <T_4> , you &apos;re ok . <T_2> &apos;ll <T_3> stop for a second .
but <T_0> i &apos;m <T_3> to tell you about today is <T_2> these <T_4> make awesome <T_1> .
<T_6> , in <T_1> arab world , there <T_4> what the <T_2> arab <T_5> al@@ bert h@@ our@@ an@@ i defin@@ es <T_0> the liber@@ al <T_3> .

<T_1> ? we designed <T_2> simple <T_3> , <T_0> it <T_5> eight langu@@ ages , and reached 3@@ 2,000 <T_4> .
in the <T_5> , a <T_0> organis@@ m appeared in <T_1> , <T_4> , <T_3> the he@@ m@@ lo@@ ck wo@@ olly <T_2> .
<T_3> is some of the <T_4> level of the <T_0> , where <T_1> exhi@@ bits <T_2> change .
in 19@@ 10 , they <T_4> at the <T_5> that <T_7> state of <T_0> gave to 14@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , <T_6> they found <T_2> they were <T_8> for soci@@ ally <T_3> con@@ crete <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> to let markets move <T_1> to their more <T_0> use .

so <T_5> actually need to <T_1> into the <T_4> and <T_0> measure what is the <T_2> of each <T_3> game .
<T_2> many people knew <T_1> fo@@ under@@ s of <T_0> and <T_5> before their faces were <T_4> a magazine <T_3> ?
and that <T_3> up our <T_1> , <T_2> it <T_0> .
so <T_3> &apos;m going to talk <T_2> about <T_4> stories <T_0> some <T_1> ways .
so <T_5> was able to do his <T_2> -- <T_3> didn &apos;t have to <T_4> in or anything ; <T_6> just went <T_0> the website <T_1> made a change .
<T_2> that &apos;s getting a little more <T_1> to a <T_0> experience .

<T_1> bill <T_5> walked away <T_3> tears <T_0> he had <T_4> to get what <T_2> wanted .
re@@ gre@@ t <T_3> the <T_6> we experience <T_7> we <T_1> that our <T_8> situation <T_5> be <T_2> or <T_9> if we had done something <T_0> in the <T_4> .
<T_5> the <T_1> idea is you <T_2> to plan your <T_6> so as to <T_3> the negative <T_0> of the <T_4> .
his hol@@ iness the kar@@ ma@@ pa talks about how he was discovered to be the <T_0> of a <T_5> figure <T_8> ti@@ bet@@ an buddh@@ ism . in telling his <T_7> , he ur@@ ges <T_9> to work on not just technology and <T_6> , but the <T_1> and design <T_3> the <T_4> . he is transl@@ ated on@@ stage by <T_2> de@@ war .
we <T_3> &apos;t have any <T_1> to go <T_0> resol@@ ve it <T_2> the u.s .
with <T_1> we have to trans@@ fer <T_0> that we <T_2> with each other .
<T_6> , almost <T_4> these genetic <T_7> we see <T_1> africa have <T_5> related <T_0> sequences that <T_2> find inside <T_3> .
he has <T_4> us <T_0> possibility <T_3> have dreams <T_2> to <T_1> true the dreams .
and what happens <T_8> you <T_1> and feed that <T_6> appropri@@ ately , is <T_0> will do a <T_3> , a <T_7> compu@@ tation <T_5> and <T_4> &apos;ll build an electron@@ ic <T_2> .
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that <T_4> of clo@@ sen@@ ess and <T_1> that en@@ ables me to find <T_5> people that <T_3> need right now , that <T_0> me to find <T_7> sour@@ ces of <T_6> , <T_2> discovery , and <T_9> inspiration <T_8> i need right now .
<T_0> we <T_2> ideas <T_1> all get more .
but <T_0> didn &apos;t actually do <T_1> .
they are <T_0> shi@@ ps .
my <T_3> work <T_0> on <T_6> , <T_7> i focused on negoti@@ ating re@@ forms <T_2> the finance mini@@ stry of <T_4> so they <T_1> access our <T_5> .

i very much <T_4> with what you &apos;re <T_1> , <T_8> it <T_0> to me that <T_6> problem with getting <T_7> interested in doing anything about <T_2> is <T_9> by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like <T_3> or heart disease <T_5> whatever . do you have any ad@@ vice ?

and <T_0> second thing <T_1> , we &apos;re going to re@@ structure its <T_2> .
it &apos;s about <T_1> what it <T_2> to be <T_3> sea <T_0> .

<T_1> may <T_0> ?
in <T_3> end , he dre@@ w <T_0> house . it <T_1> the most <T_2> thing .

<T_0> a <T_8> has happened <T_7> the <T_6> 40 years , and what i learned <T_1> i came <T_3> the gal@@ a@@ pa@@ gos is the importance of wild <T_2> , <T_5> things , certainly wild@@ life , and <T_4> amazing <T_9> that pen@@ gu@@ ins have .

<T_2> this is <T_1> the result <T_0> had <T_3> .
&quot; <T_1> &apos;m going to <T_4> and@@ ro@@ id <T_2> it &apos;s <T_3> stolen <T_0> . &quot;
<T_0> think <T_6> things we make <T_3> solve our <T_2> , <T_4> our <T_5> are much more complex than <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> about the <T_1> giving up g@@ uns .
<T_3> what <T_1> then found out <T_2> what &apos;s called the e-@@ patient <T_4> -- <T_6> &apos;ll explain <T_0> that term <T_5> .
<T_7> &apos;s part of <T_4> galaxy , <T_6> it &apos;s sh@@ ining <T_5> bri@@ ghtly as <T_2> center of <T_3> galaxy with <T_1> billion <T_0> in it .
<T_4> teachers are <T_2> di@@ verse <T_6> the <T_3> body , and <T_0> amazing <T_5> is that <T_1> are po@@ pping up .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> , <T_3> -- <T_0> can hear it very <T_1> .
so <T_1> decided <T_0> get engaged , <T_9> the <T_4> thing that i <T_8> was to come back <T_7> ghana and talk <T_6> a lot of <T_3> and really try <T_5> understand what <T_2> real issues were .
<T_2> &apos;s a very , very <T_0> idea to get them <T_1> .
the <T_3> , in fact , may be <T_1> to hand <T_6> we <T_4> , because <T_2> of those cities <T_0> &apos;re building are <T_5> .
this particular <T_8> , <T_2> &apos;ve <T_3> it the j@@ ur@@ assi@@ c <T_6> , it &apos;s thought <T_7> have gone extin@@ ct 50 <T_0> ago -- at least it <T_5> , until the cen@@ sus <T_1> it was living and doing just fine off <T_4> coast of <T_9> .
and the <T_1> goal <T_4> to increase <T_0> support for <T_3> afgh@@ an <T_2> .
it <T_2> through <T_0> principle known <T_3> k@@ in <T_1> .
and <T_2> of all , <T_0> will never <T_1> .
thank you very much .
these sequences right up <T_0> -- <T_3> don &apos;t even code <T_6> protein , <T_7> -- are almost <T_1> identical across all <T_9> these , so i <T_4> use this sequence as a mar@@ ker to <T_5> a wide spectrum of <T_8> , <T_2> having to make something individual .
it <T_9> me really feel <T_5> that civili@@ zation -- which , as i <T_8> , <T_4> you believe <T_3> scientific creation story , has emer@@ ged pur@@ ely as a result <T_1> the laws of <T_7> , and a few hydro@@ gen atoms -- then i think , to <T_2> anyway , <T_6> makes me feel incredibly <T_0> .
it &apos;s <T_1> &quot; peace <T_0> earth . &quot;
<T_4> we apply the <T_6> -- again , <T_3> the identical ti@@ me@@ -@@ scale <T_0> the identical <T_5> -- you &apos;re going to <T_2> something <T_1> .
hans rosling : asia &apos;s <T_0> -- <T_2> and <T_1>
because <T_0> you don &apos;t have that <T_2> , <T_1> , you &apos;re going to be si@@ ck or you &apos;re going to <T_3> .
<T_0> they <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_3> nap@@ k@@ in . <T_1> a <T_4> model galaxy in the <T_0> .
okay .
<T_2> , <T_1> , <T_0> don &apos;t know .
you know , they &apos;re <T_0> going to <T_2> just out <T_1> no@@ where .
liber@@ ation , however , costs some <T_0> .
<T_1> that , what this <T_0> says is , &quot; high-@@ tech sch@@ mi@@ gh@@ -@@ tech .
<T_4> in , <T_1> instance , <T_3> little matter <T_2> virg@@ ins <T_0> par@@ ad@@ ise .
so <T_3> this <T_2> , and there &apos;s two <T_1> that i would like <T_0> to be aware of .
so <T_1> have <T_0> kind of <T_2> .
and <T_2> &apos;ll <T_3> into <T_0> we &apos;ve so far been <T_1> in a moment .
<T_2> don &apos;t know <T_5> you can <T_0> see the <T_1> line <T_4> and up the <T_3> .
<T_5> , after <T_2> shoot , dirty <T_1> really didn &apos;t <T_7> , <T_0> terms of <T_8> the show is , but <T_6> changed <T_4> me , <T_3> .
we think , ken <T_3> i , <T_2> there are real <T_1> of <T_0> .
<T_8> when <T_2> material was transl@@ ated <T_5> a common <T_4> language , which is to say <T_7> , they <T_3> replac@@ ed the <T_0> ka@@ i with <T_1> latin <T_6> .
<T_1> because of that , we &apos;ve been able to <T_0> that <T_4> is a <T_3> black <T_2> there .
you <T_3> need a <T_8> people -- -- <T_5> will look at the <T_0> , realize <T_1> make no <T_2> , <T_6> realize <T_4> much <T_7> want to be connected .
the &quot; high se@@ as &quot; <T_2> a legal <T_4> , <T_1> in <T_5> , it covers 50 <T_0> of the <T_3> .
<T_2> that happens at <T_0> peri@@ pher@@ al <T_1> .
<T_1> every <T_0> point , people will go , &quot; <T_2> , <T_3> , <T_4> . &quot;
and it &apos;s a <T_3> that we &apos;ve actually been now jo@@ ined by hundreds of <T_2> around <T_7> world , <T_0> are doing <T_6> with <T_4> . indeed <T_5> of people have <T_9> been involved in <T_1> project , <T_8> many of its different aspe@@ cts .
<T_3> a few <T_1> , they had several new@@ spa@@ pers <T_2> central and <T_0> .
the <T_3> great <T_1> , which <T_2> of you are so familiar with : the <T_0> information <T_4> .
so , if i could <T_1> the <T_0> down up here .
<T_0> it <T_4> &apos;t simply <T_3> everything , it <T_1> change everything all <T_2> once . &quot;
so what <T_1> says <T_4> that sometimes <T_3> things that <T_6> least <T_9> -- the position <T_0> which you put the <T_7> -- have a <T_2> effect <T_5> any of <T_8> other things that you were trying to optimi@@ ze .
and <T_7> you <T_5> these people why they work on li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al battery , their answer <T_9> he@@ ar@@ ken back to president kenne@@ dy &apos;s re@@ mar@@ ks at rice university in 196@@ 2 when he said -- and i &apos;m taking <T_6> here -- &quot; <T_4> choose to work <T_8> gri@@ d-@@ level stor@@ age , <T_2> because <T_1> is easy , <T_3> because it is <T_0> . &quot;
au@@ bre@@ y <T_1> grey : <T_2> name &apos;s au@@ bre@@ y de <T_3> , from <T_0> .
so <T_1> had a dr@@ y <T_4> developed -- i worked with a team in nor@@ way -- <T_9> on a <T_3> of survival suit -- <T_0> sup@@ pose , that he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter pil@@ ots would <T_6> -- that i could climb <T_5> . it would go on <T_2> my boots , over my mit@@ tens , it would pull up around my <T_8> , and se@@ al pretty <T_7> around my face .
<T_1> to <T_3> , that is <T_0> , <T_2> critical .
so , maybe <T_0> dd@@ t <T_3> cro@@ ps is a <T_1> bad <T_2> .
and in 19@@ 45 , he published an article <T_2> a magazine <T_0> atlantic <T_1> .
you <T_3> a fol@@ ded <T_2> -- <T_1> this case , a <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s really what <T_0> would like <T_1> to do .
<T_0> so , for three years <T_7> was out , and <T_3> could only blin@@ k , and so i realized at this moment , i <T_9> , wow -- how fra@@ gi@@ le <T_2> this thing <T_8> &apos;re wearing , <T_6> body <T_4> mind we &apos;re wearing , and so <T_1> thought , how do <T_5> go for it more ?
<T_1> : <T_0> i am an old <T_3> . i <T_2> actually <T_4> .
we <T_3> about the well , and <T_0> talked about <T_1> these sort of <T_4> throughout <T_2> online history .
so , this <T_5> , <T_0> all the <T_1> in his <T_4> , <T_3> have the same genetic <T_2> .
<T_0> i <T_1> not <T_2> have this treatment .
the way <T_6> test <T_5> is <T_2> giving it <T_4> , as i <T_0> , of the same <T_8> that <T_1> baby , or a <T_7> in <T_3> pra@@ k@@ ash would get .
<T_3> at that point , 19@@ 12 , we <T_4> cru@@ de oil <T_2> whale <T_1> and some <T_0> coal .
<T_5> reason we can <T_4> so well <T_0> , even though <T_1> is so <T_7> people <T_6> earth , <T_2> because of the power of <T_3> .
<T_3> janu@@ ary <T_4> saw <T_5> exhi@@ bit <T_0> fern@@ and@@ o bot@@ er@@ o &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings at <T_2> u@@ c <T_1> library .

<T_3> exc@@ it@@ ement of <T_5> great <T_4> performance comes from <T_0> attemp@@ t to have <T_2> collective <T_6> musi@@ cians producing <T_7> uni@@ fied <T_1> concept .
another example <T_5> a streng@@ th date , in <T_0> we get <T_4> to identify their <T_8> streng@@ ths on the streng@@ ths test , and then <T_7> design <T_1> evening <T_2> which they both use their <T_9> , and <T_3> find this is a streng@@ th@@ en@@ er of <T_6> .
but <T_2> &apos;m <T_4> to <T_0> you that <T_3> are more mal@@ le@@ able <T_1> that .
<T_1> would offer <T_0> or <T_2> .
<T_3> means <T_6> the <T_4> that lead <T_7> to do <T_5> , <T_8> lead to the fore@@ clo@@ sure crisis <T_1> going to be <T_0> hard <T_2> over@@ come .
<T_3> , <T_0> , i &apos;m trying to get energy <T_2> for <T_1> .

<T_1> it <T_0> be because of the wine , or it <T_4> be because of <T_2> exc@@ it@@ ement , <T_6> ans@@ wer@@ ed me <T_8> and he <T_3> , &quot; <T_7> che@@ fs don &apos;t des@@ erve <T_9> fo@@ ie <T_5> . &quot;
<T_6> &apos;m pretty sure <T_2> one day we &apos;ll be <T_8> history books <T_0> of years from now . this time our <T_7> will be <T_4> as the <T_1> that got online , <T_5> generation that built <T_9> really and truly <T_3> .
a <T_6> of people <T_3> in a very engli@@ sh@@ -@@ cent@@ ric way on the <T_5> , but <T_0> us , we &apos;re <T_1> global . <T_2> &apos;re <T_4> many , <T_7> langu@@ ages .
there <T_2> no little <T_1> where we &apos;re making <T_0> .
and <T_3> , <T_2> after@@ ward , 1995 , in <T_4> , <T_1> , we had <T_0> big <T_5> .
i <T_1> these are the <T_2> people <T_3> going to <T_0> .
you can <T_1> of sk@@ et@@ ch with pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h <T_3> just google <T_2> game <T_0> .
<T_3> in most of <T_2> rest of the <T_4> , that &apos;s <T_1> the <T_0> .
so <T_3> we are . these <T_2> proto@@ cells , <T_1> their <T_0> .
<T_3> : the <T_1> on the <T_2> , <T_0> that dis@@ ney ?
and i <T_0> young <T_1> begin to <T_2> up for the <T_3> .
i <T_0> in <T_1> . <T_2> ate out regul@@ arly .
<T_5> , again , going back to <T_0> -- the idea <T_1> a <T_3> human gest@@ ure di@@ ct@@ ated <T_4> design of this <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> going to be <T_2> after i <T_1> .
as stephen <T_8> fam@@ ously <T_3> , <T_6> &apos;re just <T_4> chemical sc@@ um <T_2> the surface <T_1> a typical <T_9> that &apos;s in or@@ bit around a typical star , which is on the <T_5> of a typical <T_0> , and so <T_7> .
transpar@@ ency <T_0> be <T_1> .
if <T_2> want to <T_0> it , you can <T_1> it .
because <T_2> whole <T_0> of <T_4> suggest@@ ing that <T_7> is breaking the <T_3> and <T_1> ga@@ ther@@ ing evidence <T_6> pro@@ ving that , that turns out to <T_5> really <T_8> .
let me just tell you two really <T_0> .
<T_2> have <T_0> data elements ; we don &apos;t have a time <T_1> on them .
but there <T_6> a <T_2> world <T_7> walking , <T_1> , <T_4> , flying -- there are people <T_9> all levels , and <T_0> people tend to <T_8> somewhere <T_5> the <T_3> .
imagine now <T_6> an <T_3> reali@@ stic <T_0> -- <T_4> two black <T_1> that have lived <T_5> long life <T_2> .
<T_3> em@@ powered <T_0> , <T_2> , as a result , marg@@ in@@ alized <T_1> .
<T_2> has one of the world &apos;s largest <T_3> -- <T_1> 500 of <T_0> .
<T_0> , <T_1> name is <T_2> -- far@@ mer , <T_3> .
now music re@@ ven@@ ues <T_2> down by <T_1> eight <T_3> dollars a <T_5> since <T_0> first came on the <T_4> .
<T_4> &apos;s just <T_1> per@@ si@@ ans who aren &apos;t <T_3> human and <T_2> &apos;t <T_5> to be treated very <T_0> .
everyone in <T_1> will be <T_3> 3.@@ 2 <T_0> 3.@@ 6 <T_2> .
<T_6> &apos;s <T_4> creatures who &apos;ve never <T_2> of eu@@ cli@@ d &apos;s <T_3> po@@ stu@@ late -- <T_1> &apos;t know <T_8> was impossible to <T_5> , <T_9> they &apos;re <T_0> getting on <T_7> it .
mary dou@@ glas asked in <T_3> es@@ say <T_0> poverty <T_1> 35 <T_2> ago .
<T_0> don &apos;t think <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
so <T_8> instance , today , <T_7> ghana , <T_5> re@@ form@@ ers from <T_3> , parliament <T_4> government , have for@@ ged a <T_1> for transpar@@ ent <T_2> in the oil se@@ ctor , and , gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zed <T_9> this , re@@ form@@ ers <T_0> parliament are now investig@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous contra@@ cts <T_6>
<T_5> i <T_6> there &apos;s something really <T_4> about using <T_8> power <T_3> pro@@ pel us to <T_1> stars , <T_2> the stars <T_0> giant fusion <T_7> .
it <T_1> the <T_0> ; <T_6> in <T_3> case , <T_7> network has been important <T_4> media , <T_5> i get to connect <T_2> people .
<T_0> this <T_1> no <T_2> well .
now , there &apos;s <T_1> big <T_2> since the <T_4> bo@@ oms of the <T_0> , and that <T_3> the <T_6> of <T_5> .
<T_1> need to can@@ v@@ as <T_2> send out <T_0> .
though <T_5> was atta@@ ched to this u@@ gly , <T_1> , high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance , mechan@@ ical <T_6> , <T_7> life was kind of like <T_4> happy <T_2> in an <T_8> -- <T_9> complicated , <T_0> in a good <T_3> .
now po@@ ll@@ s <T_0> that men tell <T_5> as <T_1> lies <T_3> women -- <T_4> the <T_6> they ask told the <T_2> .
that &apos;s how <T_0> met .
so what &apos;s happening now , <T_9> the digital age , is that we <T_5> quanti@@ fy value <T_0> lots of different <T_1> and do it <T_8> easily , and <T_6> way that <T_4> quanti@@ fy those values , it makes it <T_3> easier to create new forms <T_2> val@@ id forms of cur@@ ren@@ cy <T_7>
<T_1> &apos;re fishing <T_0> the <T_2> end .
the way <T_5> suspe@@ ct <T_1> will happen is <T_7> artificial <T_3> and <T_6> chromosom@@ es , so <T_8> go <T_4> 46 to <T_0> or <T_2> .
here a community camp just organi@@ zed <T_9> the community <T_7> , where they find a place , organi@@ ze volunte@@ ers , <T_6> then we &apos;ll do our <T_8> . you know , check their vision , and then you have <T_2> who you find out what the <T_0> is and then deter@@ mine what <T_3> testing should be done , and then <T_5> tests are done by techni@@ cians who check <T_4> glas@@ ses , or check for <T_1> .
it <T_1> to get very <T_2> before we &apos;ll <T_0> attention .
<T_2> &apos;re <T_0> going to <T_3> able <T_1> do that .
so , <T_6> talk <T_8> going to be <T_0> how do <T_2> make things and <T_3> are the <T_4> ways <T_1> we &apos;re <T_9> to <T_7> things in <T_5> future .
<T_4> ad@@ h@@ d , <T_3> &apos;s often <T_1> that <T_0> hyper@@ activity caus@@ es the <T_2> dis@@ ability .
<T_2> &apos;m very <T_0> to <T_1> you <T_3> te@@ aser .
<T_2> , if <T_5> can <T_4> up the very best from a <T_3> larger <T_0> , <T_1> whe@@ el turns .
<T_2> the conversation <T_1> . all the <T_0> turned <T_3> me .
this <T_1> a <T_0> process .
i <T_0> a lot of time on the <T_1> .
<T_6> little <T_2> in front of it <T_5> the one <T_0> which , 80 <T_3> later , <T_1> colum@@ bus cros@@ sed the <T_4> .
<T_3> can <T_1> with me for <T_2> years , <T_0> tomorrow .
<T_9> i <T_5> imagine this <T_3> , you <T_4> , speaking through the <T_2> to , say , an <T_1> , saying , &quot; wow , my <T_0> , <T_8> are so incredibly <T_6> to <T_7> .
<T_9> so in <T_7> case , <T_2> it &apos;s about a <T_1> of these images <T_0> what they <T_6> , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that <T_8> thought letting the images play out <T_5> bring someone <T_4> say , &quot; well , what &apos;s world@@ chan@@ g@@ ing@@ .com , <T_3> these images , have to do ? &quot;
so my wife <T_0> ni@@ cer <T_1> i do , <T_3> i <T_4> st@@ ink more than <T_2> does .

<T_2> we <T_3> this , i set up <T_1> simulation <T_0> evening .
<T_0> with <T_4> depression , they don &apos;t have a bias <T_2> they look <T_3> the <T_1> .
but if it &apos;s somebody from another group , these terrible people -- <T_3> mean , not terrible in this -- but somebody we don &apos;t want to associ@@ ate ourselves with , <T_9> another <T_1> , <T_7> group , <T_8> of a <T_6> people &apos;s awareness of hon@@ est@@ y <T_0> up -- a little bit <T_2> the ten <T_4> experiment -- and people che@@ at even <T_5> .
<T_2> when the <T_1> press <T_5> invented what they found <T_7> they could <T_6> in@@ d@@ ul@@ gen@@ ces , <T_4> was <T_3> equivalent <T_0> printing money .
on your ri@@ ght-@@ hand side <T_3> see <T_2> cu@@ cum@@ ber lea@@ f , and <T_1> the middle <T_7> c@@ ot@@ ton lea@@ f <T_4> <T_0> on the left a to@@ ma@@ to <T_5> with these little sti@@ p@@ pl@@ ings <T_6>
the worst <T_4> in all of psych@@ ology <T_2> the idea <T_0> the mind <T_5> a blank <T_1> at <T_3> .
<T_2> said , &quot; <T_5> , <T_4> are the <T_1> and most able <T_3> in the <T_0> .
and remember <T_0> was telling you about har@@ ry <T_1> .
and <T_0> run <T_1> in <T_4> very remote <T_2> where there &apos;s no <T_3> care <T_5> .
just do <T_0> outside , please . &quot;
and <T_2> this <T_4> , the ra@@ il minister <T_3> sa@@ cked and sent@@ enced to ja@@ il <T_0> 10 <T_1> .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a <T_7> ago when i <T_5> out i was pre@@ g@@ nant <T_4> the <T_9> scan reve@@ aled that <T_0> baby had a birth de@@ fe@@ ct associated <T_3> ex@@ pos@@ ure to <T_2> chemicals <T_6> the wom@@ b and the second <T_8> reve@@ aled <T_1> he@@ art@@ beat .
<T_0> the reason <T_1> , <T_2> &apos;s been done .
the <T_0> from <T_1> was a little bit more <T_2> .
<T_1> he <T_0> contro@@ ls it .
<T_0> you &apos;re <T_3> at how <T_1> dra@@ pes <T_4> and <T_2> from the body .
<T_6> of <T_2> will remember <T_0> super c@@ ute video <T_3> the last ted , but <T_4> all quad@@ cop@@ ter s@@ war@@ ms are <T_5> nice and <T_1> .
we were too <T_2> into <T_5> summer ; the <T_8> was starting to <T_4> ; we spoke <T_6> the rus@@ si@@ an <T_9> on the radio , and <T_1> said , &quot; look <T_0> , <T_3> &apos;ve run out of <T_7> .
<T_5> goal <T_4> robo@@ tics <T_9> to un@@ lo@@ ck everyone &apos;s mental power <T_1> making <T_7> world more physi@@ cally <T_8> to <T_6> such as myself <T_2> others <T_0> me around <T_3> glo@@ be .
be@@ au <T_1> : <T_3> , <T_0> game is very <T_2> .
so , <T_7> based on how a pra@@ ir@@ ie buil@@ ds soil , ran@@ ching based on how a native un@@ gu@@ late her@@ d <T_4> incre@@ ases the health of the <T_1> , <T_9> waste@@ water treatment based <T_0> how a <T_5> not <T_6> cle@@ ans the <T_8> , <T_3> creates incredibly <T_2> produ@@ ctivity .
so , <T_0> are <T_1> dark <T_2> .
so let <T_5> show you a <T_8> -- a piece from that <T_4> -- and <T_1> a <T_2> also -- so this <T_0> a <T_6> , where <T_7> my <T_3> , she was at the dep@@ ths <T_9> mortality .
<T_1> &apos;s the <T_3> great <T_4> we have in <T_2> health care <T_0> .
to get <T_0> that <T_6> , we genu@@ in@@ ely <T_3> to <T_4> building demand in <T_2> societies <T_1> the <T_5> .
<T_5> shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers tend to <T_3> you things like <T_0> oni@@ on or <T_6> as@@ pir@@ in , or a piece of <T_2> , <T_1> they don &apos;t have <T_4> change .
<T_2> close , i <T_4> to <T_6> out <T_5> we &apos;re also explor@@ ing <T_1> business models for <T_3> new field <T_0> neuro@@ technology .
<T_0> other <T_2> obviously a computer <T_1> .
and what <T_3> had to do <T_1> -- <T_5> you wanted to <T_4> in this , you had <T_0> share pac@@ ke@@ ts <T_2> information .
but <T_2> &apos;s not <T_0> &apos;s interesting <T_1> this .
<T_2> wi@@ ped her <T_0> off her <T_1> .
<T_0> about <T_1> those other <T_2> ?
<T_1> you heard <T_2> now what the goal <T_0> .
<T_0> , <T_2> when they <T_3> , they write <T_1> on them .
and i <T_2> what <T_3> &apos;ll see <T_1> is this notion of <T_0> global one-@@ world class@@ room .
they <T_5> going to think about <T_2> as this gl@@ ori@@ ous <T_8> when <T_1> la@@ id down the very <T_7> of their <T_6> , <T_4> their <T_3> , of their <T_0> .
but <T_5> , <T_6> started a@@ ero@@ viron@@ ment , with no <T_3> -- then <T_0> or <T_7> , <T_8> , and sort of <T_1> along on trying <T_4> get <T_2> projects .
<T_1> &apos;re <T_4> sun <T_2> , <T_3> , you know , with <T_0> .
so , the <T_3> issue <T_1> : how <T_0> you tan@@ gi@@ bili@@ tate <T_2> ?
and <T_2> you get <T_9> ? i certainly <T_7> so , <T_5> at some point or another <T_4> this <T_0> , one of <T_1> team@@ mates is going to have to take a very <T_8> nee@@ d@@ le , and put it in <T_3> infe@@ cted bli@@ ster , and dra@@ in it <T_6> you .

<T_4> found <T_9> listening to a consu@@ l@@ t@@ ant <T_2> day who <T_5> trying to <T_8> teachers boo@@ st <T_3> test sc@@ or@@ es of <T_6> kids , so <T_1> the school would reach <T_0> eli@@ te categ@@ ory in per@@ cent@@ age <T_7> kids pas@@ sing big tests .
he said -- he called <T_0> he &apos;d <T_1> as making -- they didn &apos;t call it a <T_2> at the time .
we hit the <T_4> gl@@ ac@@ ial maximum <T_0> 16@@ ,000 <T_1> ago , but basically , from 7@@ 0,000 <T_6> on , things were getting <T_7> tough , getting very <T_3> . <T_2> northern he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere had <T_5> growing ice she@@ ets .
<T_2> &apos;s actually <T_0> base@@ ball fields on it right now , <T_3> they &apos;re going to stay <T_1> .
<T_1> gre@@ e@@ ks say <T_0> suff@@ er <T_2> way <T_3> wisdom .
but before we do that , i &apos;d like <T_4> to think that at any given time <T_9> you &apos;re sitting there , in <T_0> 70 trillion cells , <T_3> extra@@ cell@@ ular <T_6> sign@@ aling to your <T_5> , the <T_2> is sign@@ aling to your extra@@ cell@@ ular <T_8> and <T_1> is how your balance is kept <T_7> re@@ stor@@ ed .
we <T_0> that hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es have <T_2> happened in the <T_1> . &quot;
<T_9> has just discovered <T_5> , <T_3> about the most dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous <T_7> on earth ; <T_1> has discovered <T_6> ; gu@@ ine@@ a <T_2> got a <T_8> new explo@@ itation of ir@@ on ore coming <T_4> of the <T_0> .
but <T_4> we did <T_0> first <T_7> , <T_1> actually asked art ca@@ plan &apos;s team at the university of pennsylvania to <T_6> a re@@ view of what the ris@@ ks , the <T_5> , <T_3> eth@@ ics around creating new <T_2> in the <T_9> were because <T_8> hadn &apos;t been done before .
<T_4> nobody <T_2> imitation the <T_1> &quot; dirty <T_0> &quot; guys know it has <T_3> be done .
and after 70 hours of <T_6> singing lessons , he found <T_0> the <T_8> was <T_9> to <T_1> re@@ wi@@ re <T_3> brains of his patients and create a hom@@ olog@@ ous <T_2> center in <T_7> right he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere <T_4> comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te for the <T_5> he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere &apos;s damage .
you &apos;ve got to do <T_2> in the <T_1> ; you &apos;ve got to do <T_3> in the <T_0> .
now maybe this <T_4> what the <T_0> of the <T_2> might <T_5> like in 10 <T_1> 20 <T_3> .
<T_1> i don &apos;t mean <T_0> imag@@ in@@ ative use <T_4> politics -- <T_3> mean <T_2> imag@@ in@@ ative use <T_5> .
<T_6> where we used to think of heart disease <T_0> being a man &apos;s problem pri@@ mar@@ ily -- which <T_8> was never <T_4> , but <T_3> was kind of <T_1> everybody thought <T_2> the <T_5> and &apos; 60s , <T_9> it was in <T_7> the text@@ books .
<T_5> could look at nature <T_7> being like a <T_0> of <T_4> , <T_2> all of <T_6> have benef@@ ited from <T_1> 3.@@ 8@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ year <T_3> and development period .

this past <T_5> , in <T_6> , you can see <T_8> they &apos;re now <T_0> about a four@@ th of a <T_9> , and some of <T_1> individuals are going more <T_3> 9@@ 00 <T_4> away <T_7> their <T_2> .
<T_2> politi@@ cians making good decisions <T_0> my <T_1> ?
right ? and <T_4> i realized , <T_7> was on <T_0> website , and <T_5> it said , like , you know , <T_1> quote was attribu@@ ted <T_6> me <T_2> i <T_8> , <T_3> , <T_9> said something , you know , in an interview .
<T_0> is <T_2> three-@@ wee@@ k-@@ old <T_1> .
<T_2> su@@ ck up <T_1> the water , <T_0> to themselves , <T_4> they <T_5> feed the lower <T_3> .
<T_6> to look for a way <T_4> prevent <T_5> in <T_2> , <T_0> went back <T_1> look <T_3> cancer &apos;s caus@@ es .
and <T_4> , we <T_0> only <T_1> great as <T_3> imagination , as <T_5> as <T_2> dream .
finally <T_1> up to <T_2> , it <T_0> .
so <T_9> invented bur@@ la@@ p sa@@ cks , bun@@ ker <T_1> -- <T_4> putting the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um -- using stor@@ m blo@@ wn <T_2> , you <T_0> take these <T_5> sa@@ cks and put them down@@ stream from a farm that &apos;s producing e@@ . col@@ i , or other <T_6> , or a fac@@ tory with <T_8> tox@@ ins , and <T_3> leads <T_7> hab@@ it@@ at re@@ stor@@ ation .
<T_0> this time , instead of <T_5> product being <T_4> by the <T_1> , it was <T_3> by <T_2> human body .
<T_0> could <T_4> that for a <T_1> , <T_3> arm , <T_2> like that .
<T_2> came to live <T_0> , and <T_3> am living <T_1> .

it &apos;s <T_0> little <T_4> and <T_3> , where lots <T_5> interesting <T_2> went on , all <T_1> long .
now , there &apos;s <T_5> part of that community which <T_2> commercial <T_1> , the ones <T_6> make <T_4> li@@ ve@@ lihood <T_3> bee@@ keeping <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;re going to be around for <T_0> next few <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;d <T_1> to play to you guys , <T_4> you &apos;re <T_3> to be the first <T_2> to <T_5> it .
and <T_6> what was then a <T_7> small organization <T_3> just a few <T_1> , trying <T_2> even begin to think how <T_0> might <T_8> that <T_5> an <T_4> challenge .
it <T_1> some <T_2> serious <T_0> .
basically , what they &apos;re doing is looking at <T_1> as <T_2> programm@@ able <T_0> .

<T_2> . i <T_1> all <T_0> faces .
<T_2> basically <T_5> i <T_9> &apos;t tell you <T_8> that <T_3> 500 million years ago , organisms star@@ ter making <T_0> , <T_4> it <T_6> them about 50 <T_1> years to get <T_7> at it .
a <T_0> bit of differenti@@ al , <T_1> not <T_2> .
<T_1> some <T_4> i <T_6> remember@@ ing <T_5> lady <T_3> grey <T_7> que@@ en of <T_2> when she was <T_0> 15 .
<T_0> is about <T_3> place <T_4> london called <T_2> &apos;s <T_8> where i used to go and spend <T_7> going &quot; <T_1> is <T_9> coming back ? <T_5> is <T_6> coming back ? &quot;
the <T_9> day -- <T_5> next day , not <T_4> 24 <T_7> had passed -- in <T_1> , <T_8> president of <T_0> said , &quot; <T_6> &apos;ll do <T_2> . &quot; and boom , a little <T_3> .
<T_3> she pulled <T_1> the <T_5> of the scan <T_2> , and look at <T_0> those hot <T_4> .
<T_4> would have been deeply <T_3> by today &apos;s <T_2> between science <T_1> the <T_0> of culture .
<T_1> i looked at <T_4> , i <T_2> that <T_6> , <T_5> i <T_0> something beyond what i was seeing <T_3> angel@@ ine .
<T_0> was just <T_1> .
also , if <T_2> think <T_0> it , <T_3> always have bat <T_5> , <T_4> birds , they typically -- or <T_1> have bird <T_6> .
and i <T_4> free for dinner , and <T_0> went out to dinner <T_2> the <T_1> of <T_5> in <T_3> .
&quot; <T_1> the <T_2> of <T_0> is <T_3> age of choices . &quot;
why <T_1> &apos;t we have these kinds of <T_3> with our own <T_2> and <T_4> who <T_0> be <T_5> ?
there <T_0> the re@@ tail shops , the <T_8> and the restaurants , and the community <T_3> this community of <T_9> chri@@ sti@@ ans , <T_2> you &apos;ll also find <T_1> church , along with the <T_5> of religi@@ ous <T_6> throughout the <T_7> , and <T_4> all the everyday services like the electron@@ ic re@@ pair shops , the bar@@ bers , everything .
<T_2> , <T_1> little bit of <T_3> -- about 10,000 <T_0> of perspective .
<T_3> wine glass at dinner is <T_2> from <T_1> other <T_0> at the <T_4> party .
but <T_0> alone <T_2> &apos;t <T_1> .
and if you &apos;re going to <T_9> , &quot; <T_6> &apos;m going to <T_1> talking about <T_2> , &quot; you can take <T_4> the <T_7> <T_0> species &quot; and throw <T_8> out of the window , for it <T_5> about nothing else but sele@@ ctive <T_3>
so let &apos;s ab@@ and@@ on <T_0> paradigm of let &apos;s search <T_4> the <T_5> chemistry and <T_6> hopefully we &apos;ll ch@@ ase down <T_3> cost cur@@ ve <T_2> just making <T_7> and lots of <T_1> .
these actually <T_0> sold <T_1> art@@ work .
it was <T_1> well before he <T_0> , and <T_3> it &apos;s on its <T_2> legs .
what <T_6> means is that if you could shr@@ ink <T_5> earth to the size of a billi@@ ard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its moun@@ tain top@@ s and <T_1> and rain@@ forests , astron@@ au@@ ts and un@@ cont@@ ac@@ ted tri@@ bes and <T_9> , vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s , <T_0> , cho@@ col@@ ate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shr@@ ink that to the <T_3> of a billi@@ ard <T_7> , it would be as smo@@ oth <T_8> a <T_2> , pres@@ um@@ ably a billi@@ ard ball with a s@@ light bul@@ ge around the middle <T_4>
<T_2> that is <T_0> i <T_1> .
<T_6> science <T_5> different , more <T_2> , than <T_3> mathema@@ tic@@ s-@@ based <T_7> that we &apos;ve had <T_0> the <T_4> 300 or <T_1> years .
so we <T_0> there with <T_1> truck . <T_3> is <T_2> photo@@ bo@@ oth truck .
today <T_2> &apos;s less than <T_0> c@@ ents a <T_1> .
they didn &apos;t do <T_1> with <T_0> computer .
there <T_0> flexible , <T_1> blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
and <T_1> said , &quot; <T_0> didn &apos;t have , until this moment , <T_2> compassion .
and <T_1> you look clo@@ sely <T_5> these <T_2> forms , <T_3> &apos;ll notice <T_0> the can@@ di@@ date list is in a <T_4> order <T_6> each one .
thank <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;re <T_0> taking the <T_1> yet .
i &apos;m going home for a mi@@ d@@ term . <T_0> ri@@ ot &apos;s going <T_1> on campus .
the radi@@ ologists <T_2> , in turn , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for <T_1> their own <T_0> self-@@ interest .
and <T_0> you draw the <T_1> the <T_2> of <T_4> the lot@@ tery <T_3> 100 percent .
<T_0> exists . what <T_2> a <T_1> ?
<T_0> promis@@ ed to raise the <T_2> with her <T_1> .
our <T_2> would show bill <T_0> the <T_1> guy .
<T_2> way of putting it is that as <T_6> think of <T_4> in the 21@@ st century , we <T_5> to get away from <T_1> idea that <T_7> &apos;s always zero <T_8> -- <T_3> gain is <T_9> loss <T_0> vice ver@@ sa .
<T_0> was at <T_7> moment , in <T_3> very small <T_2> of 3@@ 0,000 or so , that <T_4> truly appreci@@ ated the <T_5> of the <T_8> and <T_6> se@@ arch@@ ing <T_1> might do in <T_9> .

i <T_2> to tell you <T_3> little bit <T_1> my <T_0> .
and <T_3> didn &apos;t give the talk <T_1> . <T_2> did , and <T_4> had to watch <T_0> , and so <T_5> .
<T_2> , <T_1> . <T_3> see people <T_0> down like this .
in <T_5> partner@@ shi@@ ps , i have <T_4> learned <T_9> people <T_8> to com@@ part@@ ment@@ alize <T_7> into it people , and movie star people , and <T_0> , but when we share nature , when we share <T_2> perspe@@ cti@@ ves about <T_1> , we find <T_3> common <T_6> .

<T_1> turns out , maybe not <T_3> , that students <T_4> getting the <T_5> content <T_2> the <T_6> universities for <T_0> .
now , 20@@ th-@@ century psych@@ ologists <T_6> soci@@ ologists were thinking about stran@@ gers , <T_5> they weren &apos;t <T_2> so <T_0> about <T_4> relations , and <T_1> were thinking about stran@@ gers in the context of <T_3> practic@@ es .
<T_2> is <T_1> completely different <T_0> .
<T_0> ? here we <T_1> .
then <T_0> of del@@ eting those positive <T_5> , what i <T_3> do is come into a <T_2> like this <T_1> and say , <T_4> ?
<T_2> is , in fact , <T_0> important . i &apos;ll explain to you <T_1> .
<T_5> , <T_7> know <T_0> you &apos;re thinking : &quot; <T_8> &apos;s a lot of <T_2> , <T_4> &apos;t it ? isn &apos;t <T_6> a <T_1> of work <T_9> be able to tell the <T_3> ? &quot;

<T_3> we <T_0> that , <T_2> really can make <T_1> history .
what i have in mind <T_3> : <T_0> happens <T_1> ; <T_2> over@@ re@@ act <T_4> it .
<T_1> from all different <T_2> of discipl@@ ines , they <T_3> of themselves as <T_0> analy@@ tical .
<T_2> the entire world with <T_0> percent wind <T_4> <T_1> would need about one <T_5> of <T_3> land .
i &apos;m going to <T_1> about <T_0> stories <T_2> .
would <T_1> mind taking <T_2> brain out , and i <T_3> want <T_0> to <T_4> something .
you <T_3> , <T_0> have <T_1> fair@@ ly interesting <T_2> right now .

i <T_2> have been <T_4> and a half then , and it <T_3> love <T_1> first <T_0> .
and when <T_9> got into <T_1> -- through a <T_5> of forces that <T_3> trying to clean up <T_0> in <T_2> -- they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed <T_8> report , spent about two million pounds on <T_6> and <T_4> associated <T_7> .
<T_6> what ni@@ ck <T_3> was he brought back <T_2> story <T_0> went <T_4> the ol@@ d-@@ school method of just straight , &quot; <T_1> &apos;t this <T_7> amazing <T_5> ? &quot;
<T_1> we were <T_4> to cross this <T_5> , called the <T_0> valley , in terms <T_2> -- artificial <T_3> terms .
it was a <T_1> , and <T_2> <T_0> re@@ ti@@ red .
so <T_7> about with our approach , ad@@ ding the <T_5> ? and you <T_8> see that <T_4> &apos;s much <T_1> . <T_3> only can you <T_0> that it &apos;s a baby &apos;s face , but <T_2> can tell that <T_9> &apos;s this baby &apos;s face , which is a <T_6> challenging task .
he <T_0> said , <T_3> janu@@ ary , <T_5> he would <T_4> sign a bill that granted <T_6> im@@ m@@ unity <T_1> possibly <T_7> sp@@ ying on <T_2> person@@ s .
it &apos;s <T_0> because <T_5> &apos;re natur@@ ally <T_1> in other intelligent <T_2> , and i think <T_4> &apos;s <T_6> of our <T_3> .
did <T_0> wish to see <T_1> re@@ move them ?
we <T_0> start with <T_2> , or as some <T_1> it , min@@ e-@@ go@@ lia .
<T_1> have to do <T_3> carbon off@@ set <T_2> another way , <T_4> i do <T_0> time .
allo@@ wing me to believe that the <T_9> people we have loved and <T_0> in our <T_7> , <T_8> the public fig@@ ures we have respe@@ cted <T_3> our history , just as abraham lincoln wanted to <T_6> , really can live on , so long as we <T_5> to tell <T_1> to re@@ tell the <T_4> of their <T_2> .
<T_0> this is <T_5> simple <T_4> , <T_2> tomorrow we want to be able to <T_3> more <T_1> signals .
it &apos;s an <T_2> world <T_1> &apos;re all <T_0> together .
<T_3> : and <T_1> have to <T_6> that , <T_0> a male <T_5> is killed , it completely <T_2> the <T_4> pri@@ de .
and so now you can see why <T_2> proposed this <T_0> : i <T_1> my <T_3> .
it will <T_2> 100 <T_1> two <T_4> . <T_0> will go below <T_3> .
they <T_0> to hun@@ ker down , <T_1> want to look to the <T_2> .
on <T_1> , <T_5> was just <T_2> completely poin@@ t@@ less <T_4> of <T_0> that i would <T_3> .
<T_6> let me <T_3> you , i &apos;m going to start <T_0> the <T_5> structure , <T_4> i can <T_2> a <T_1> inter@@ n@@ al organs .
that <T_3> see , <T_0> hori@@ zon@@ tal ax@@ is <T_2> where you place <T_1> country .
thank you .
it <T_2> &apos;t . <T_0> was <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_1> tree is situ@@ ated right next to <T_0> beautiful <T_3> .
i <T_0> in global <T_1> .
now <T_6> &apos;s <T_3> in <T_0> , but <T_1> has managed , <T_2> his own <T_5> , to get <T_4> film out .
so you &apos;ve got food economy <T_0> local food at the <T_2> , you &apos;ve got greenhouse g@@ ases , <T_3> and <T_1> waste .
if you <T_7> nature , the best thing you can do is <T_2> the <T_6> away from <T_3> , move to <T_1> city , and <T_0> den@@ ser the <T_9> , and <T_4> den@@ ser cities like <T_5> are the cities that per@@ form <T_8> best .
so when <T_0> did , we found some very <T_1> things .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> for <T_2> to get in the <T_1> . &quot;
<T_4> &apos;s <T_2> condition : you <T_3> write like <T_0> . like <T_1> !
it was <T_7> easy <T_4> remember seeing dogs , not so <T_5> to <T_6> p@@ ig@@ s . and each one <T_9> you <T_0> that if <T_8> on <T_2> came more <T_1> to your mind , then dogs <T_3> le@@ as@@ hes are more prob@@ able .
<T_1> : you &apos;ve <T_3> heard the frank l@@ loy@@ d w@@ right story , <T_2> the <T_8> called and <T_7> , &quot; mr. <T_0> , <T_9> &apos;m sitting <T_6> the <T_4> and the water &apos;s po@@ uring in on my <T_5> . &quot;
so <T_8> i did <T_6> , and as <T_1> think many of <T_9> do <T_4> , we kind of <T_2> our <T_0> , we kind of <T_3> our right to <T_7> on with <T_5> day .

that is to <T_7> , if something <T_3> -- and <T_9> &apos;ve never <T_4> anything like this happen , <T_0> i &apos;ve only been looking <T_1> 20 years -- <T_8> something <T_6> , they might <T_2> come out if they <T_5> .
the traditional thing <T_1> to <T_0> right ?

i &apos;m going <T_1> become a <T_0> old <T_2> .
<T_1> it just <T_0> wind or a <T_2> pre@@ dat@@ or ?
<T_0> of this project say , hang on .
<T_0> also have <T_1> very own <T_2> .
we used <T_0> to do that .
<T_0> this a <T_1> ? yes , it &apos;s <T_2> big a <T_3> .
and in <T_1> case , <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> inter@@ medi@@ ary robotic <T_6> that can <T_5> do some of <T_4> fron@@ t-@@ end work <T_7> us , to <T_3> any potential <T_8> that we find .

<T_4> think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell <T_2> what &apos;s really <T_3> and <T_7> &apos;s not , and <T_6> made <T_8> realize that <T_5> devices and <T_9> conne@@ ctivity matter to us right up <T_1> with <T_0> and shel@@ ter .
<T_3> the u.k. we have <T_0> national <T_2> for clinical <T_4> , <T_1> .

at least <T_0> percent of the homes <T_1> the <T_3> are <T_2> with black <T_4> .
<T_4> was <T_3> when <T_1> decided to <T_5> it , <T_0> i &apos;m in the <T_2> of it now .
<T_2> anybody know <T_1> the <T_0> was invented ?
and of <T_5> , we may be <T_7> -- <T_6> &apos;t all been <T_4> , <T_3> &apos;re in the <T_0> of thinking about it -- but so <T_1> , it <T_2> good .
within <T_1> years , <T_4> had multi@@ pli@@ ed that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times into <T_2> million dollars <T_5> all expen@@ ses <T_0> aids <T_3> .

<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> to nothing . especially designed <T_1> me .

so i <T_1> to go <T_9> the <T_6> finding <T_2> best and <T_8> scientists i could at <T_5> whose collective disco@@ ver@@ ies have the <T_0> to take us there , and we formed <T_3> company to build on <T_4> extraordinary <T_7> .
all <T_3> the bor@@ e@@ al , we &apos;re <T_2> with <T_0> incredible <T_4> of <T_1> .

now , i was taken by in@@ spe@@ ctor bri@@ an <T_0> , of the royal can@@ adi@@ an moun@@ ted police , to a <T_4> war@@ e@@ house east of vancou@@ ver to <T_6> some of the goo@@ ds which are regul@@ arly <T_3> by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sen@@ ding it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market <T_8> b@@ .@@ c. <T_1> , as <T_5> &apos;s called , in part <T_9> it &apos;s mark@@ et@@ ed as organic , which of course <T_7> down very well <T_2> california .

this is <T_0> positive <T_1> .
<T_3> that &apos;s <T_4> surprising , <T_6> we also asked <T_0> to ju@@ dge them on <T_2> , <T_1> , <T_5> , <T_7> .
no so@@ on@@ er was <T_2> proposed than <T_3> in <T_1> adop@@ ted it , <T_4> it <T_0> published the re@@ ven@@ ues in <T_5> paper .
and <T_2> fac@@ ed <T_0> whole <T_1> set of challenges .
there <T_0> nine <T_1> humans coming our way .
other <T_1> make <T_2> op@@ posite <T_0> .
<T_1> : now tesla &apos;s brain worked <T_0> the most extraordinary way <T_2>
because <T_0> challenge <T_3> not losing <T_2> , it &apos;s <T_1> keeping <T_4> off .
<T_6> about 18@@ 5@@ 2 , they &apos;re <T_4> , &quot; am <T_5> the <T_8> person on <T_1> by not rus@@ hing <T_0> california ? &quot; <T_3> they start <T_7> decide they <T_2> .
<T_0> they do <T_2> by <T_1> ? that &apos;s kind of a <T_3> a vel@@ cro@@ -@@ like thing .
it &apos;s <T_3> up <T_2> . <T_0> groups are more <T_1> .
and <T_4> you &apos;re in <T_0> half-@@ mile <T_6> of where <T_3> bom@@ b went off , you <T_5> a <T_7> percent <T_1> of not <T_2> it .
i actually ran out , i spent <T_0> much money on <T_1> road <T_8> for the <T_6> that <T_2> had to take my <T_7> off , so i <T_3> to , i went to seattle and i <T_4> some time with friends working <T_9> a really <T_5> project .

<T_2> is one of <T_0> fo@@ under@@ s , <T_1> sch@@ a@@ eff@@ er .
<T_6> was <T_2> to explain something <T_1> me : a <T_0> experiment that uses <T_3> to <T_5> down <T_4> .
i <T_0> to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
if you look <T_3> areas <T_6> these <T_0> are completely available , the price <T_1> low or <T_4> , <T_5> deaths still <T_2> ab@@ ated .
i <T_2> &apos;t <T_5> anything at all ; it &apos;s a <T_0> that has <T_4> for <T_3> million <T_1> .

well , there <T_0> some kind of execu@@ tive <T_5> , but <T_3> the <T_4> is -- <T_1> and <T_2> .
specifically , <T_5> use these <T_2> design dire@@ cti@@ ves , <T_7> the most important being number <T_0> : <T_9> design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ -@@ focused <T_6> , <T_3> &apos;s not <T_4> designing <T_1> cli@@ ents <T_8> .

<T_1> &apos;s a total <T_0> cir@@ cus .

and <T_5> &apos;s really <T_4> to re@@ call , <T_6> a <T_3> fra@@ me <T_0> mind , just how <T_1> life can be at <T_2> best .
<T_0> diff@@ ri@@ ent : re@@ thinking <T_1> way we sit down
<T_3> the <T_1> , the global <T_2> of the talent pool <T_0> .
<T_5> what happens <T_9> that in a way <T_6> have a much bigger <T_2> , but it <T_0> and bran@@ ches down <T_3> di@@ stances about the same <T_7> a <T_4> , for a man and for <T_8> little <T_1> .
so out went <T_3> green <T_1> and in came the <T_0> and <T_2> prin@@ ts .
it &apos;s kind of like you have <T_1> these <T_4> sensor@@ s , and inside <T_0> brain is <T_2> little <T_3> .
<T_0> is <T_1> linear .
<T_2> , <T_0> forward <T_1> years , to <T_3> 2007 .
<T_7> , <T_4> that <T_0> , we &apos;ve actually been through an <T_5> boom , the <T_6> boom ever <T_3> the <T_1> of this <T_2> .
what &apos;s happening now , in this <T_0> called <T_5> , is that people are beginning to <T_1> that <T_4> , <T_6> organisms , <T_8> rest of the natural <T_2> , are doing <T_7> very <T_3> to <T_9> we need to do .

<T_1> , it &apos;s worse <T_0> that .
<T_2> terrible <T_4> . it was <T_1> the united states . <T_3> was <T_0> europe .
they <T_0> listen <T_1> join the conversation .
<T_3> , so <T_0> ask what <T_2> sustainable restaurant <T_1> like .
what <T_0> that <T_1> do ?
<T_0> have got <T_5> go beyond this paradigm <T_2> isol@@ ated <T_3> doing <T_6> care to multi@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary <T_1> doing <T_4> care .
and i &apos;ve come to the <T_9> -- this <T_1> my <T_4> year doing <T_7> research -- <T_3> vulner@@ ability is our most <T_0> measu@@ re@@ ment of <T_5> -- to <T_2> vulnerable , to let <T_6> be seen , to <T_8> honest .
grand@@ ma <T_3> lo@@ g <T_4> that robot <T_1> play hi@@ de-@@ and-@@ go@@ -@@ see@@ k with <T_8> grand@@ daughter for <T_9> minutes <T_6> single night , when other@@ wise <T_0> might <T_7> be able to get to see her grand@@ daughter once <T_5> twice a <T_2> .
<T_2> achiev@@ ed a <T_0> child mortality <T_1> we started <T_3> .
and <T_0> dri@@ ll@@ ed <T_2> the ross <T_1> .
as <T_0> realized , just <T_1> with many many <T_5> in <T_4> life that <T_2> actually <T_6> , i <T_3> to it .
<T_0> are being <T_1> .
we &apos;ve had <T_0> different <T_1> .
i <T_5> so <T_2> to watch the <T_1> of that south <T_3> into the <T_0> south africa as i went <T_4> by <T_6> .
<T_6> this <T_2> not what <T_1> call a laborat@@ or@@ y-@@ scale experiment , <T_5> they <T_3> &apos;t have liked it <T_0> my <T_4> .
and <T_0> &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the field . it &apos;s been a <T_1> amount of <T_2> .
<T_1> wasn &apos;t being <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s quite <T_2> , actually , to get <T_0> very small <T_3> .
and <T_6> reason for doing so , <T_2> the center of this photograph , <T_7> lin@@ us pau@@ ling . about six months before , <T_5> proposed the alpha heli@@ cal structure <T_3> proteins . and in <T_9> so , <T_1> ban@@ ished the man out on the <T_0> , sir <T_4> bra@@ g@@ g , who was the <T_8> professor .
<T_2> are even able to <T_1> -- <T_0> are <T_3> .
and then <T_0> happened ?
<T_7> one of the young <T_2> in <T_6> project , <T_4> was <T_0> fantastic <T_5> , she actually built <T_3> room in the <T_1> .
<T_6> i knew , right <T_8> , <T_0> age six , <T_5> is <T_2> animal <T_4> i want to <T_3> more about . <T_1> i <T_7> .
and <T_9> did , and we ended up nam@@ ing <T_3> du@@ ter@@ im@@ b@@ ere , meaning &quot; <T_1> go forward with enthusias@@ m . &quot; and while <T_7> were doing it , i <T_8> that there <T_6> &apos;t a lot <T_0> businesses that were vi@@ able and <T_2> by <T_4> , and so maybe i should try to run <T_5> business , too .
<T_2> the <T_4> would run out of hospital be@@ ds <T_0> the <T_1> week , <T_3> two <T_5> .
<T_2> didn &apos;t get in as much <T_3> . they <T_0> better <T_1> .
so , the <T_6> is <T_2> coming from <T_0> nor@@ the@@ ast out <T_5> india , across the <T_1> ocean , this <T_4> towards <T_3> .
and <T_4> , however , you are <T_5> very early , diagno@@ sed early , <T_0> can start , <T_1> even <T_2> hi@@ v-@@ posi@@ tives , it makes <T_3> .
imagine making <T_1> free , so that <T_3> in <T_5> world can have access <T_2> all of this knowledge , and imagine using information <T_4> so that you can <T_9> this <T_7> , improve it , <T_6> with it , on a ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale that &apos;s more on the order <T_8> seconds instead <T_0> years .
<T_0> of these design for the <T_4> that people like to <T_1> and <T_3> want to <T_2> .
both <T_0> improve .
so <T_5> are <T_1> few <T_0> that bring <T_3> humans together in the <T_4> that an election <T_2> .
<T_6> this <T_0> fantastic . and <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> temp@@ ting <T_3> think that <T_5> &apos;s all <T_1> me .
<T_0> have <T_2> fight <T_1> what <T_8> believe . <T_7> don &apos;t <T_6> win everything <T_3> want to win . but <T_5> can ste@@ er the <T_4> .
we <T_2> that we <T_0> don &apos;t <T_5> everything , and <T_3> nature is so <T_6> , we have to <T_1> open at all <T_4> .
and on <T_2> of <T_8> , now we have a whole <T_6> of other <T_0> that have come up and <T_9> to talk <T_3> us from doing it for <T_7> cam@@ ps , mobile you@@ th <T_1> , right down to <T_5> world c@@ up and <T_4> olymp@@ ics .
and <T_2> see the angl@@ es of the <T_1> at <T_0> angl@@ es , there .
<T_0> is my <T_4> public de@@ bt clock , and , as you can <T_5> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> trillion and <T_2> .
hack@@ ath@@ ons and <T_1> and working with <T_5> to build apps is <T_3> intelli@@ gi@@ ble way <T_8> people to <T_4> and partici@@ pate , <T_9> the <T_6> is , but <T_2> &apos;re going to need <T_7> more <T_0> like it .
that is the most <T_0> number you can have .
but <T_2> &apos;ll make huge <T_4> in your <T_0> and development , <T_5> we &apos;ll give <T_3> an <T_1> of pe@@ ers <T_6> &quot;
and <T_7> thought <T_1> would be <T_5> wonderful <T_6> to listen to <T_4> ch@@ est or listen to <T_0> ab@@ d@@ omen <T_2> what <T_3> called &quot; the cy@@ lin@@ der . &quot;
<T_0> is <T_1> a feeling .
<T_5> you just , <T_7> , have <T_6> send little <T_2> fac@@ tor@@ ies up there that <T_3> up <T_8> ir@@ on <T_0> on the <T_4> of mars <T_1> sp@@ it out the oxygen .
we &apos;re <T_2> through 2,000 lat@@ ti@@ ce <T_1> atoms -- <T_3> , <T_4> and <T_0> .
<T_0> , <T_1> you &apos;re <T_3> , you <T_2> &apos;t want to watch .
that led <T_7> a whole series of <T_9> campaig@@ ns in japan , and <T_1> &apos;m really proud <T_8> say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult <T_5> buy anything in <T_2> that &apos;s <T_3> in@@ corre@@ ctly , even <T_0> they &apos;re <T_4> s@@ elling whale meat , which i believe <T_6> shouldn &apos;t .
<T_2> person <T_1> to you <T_0> a bro@@ ther , is a <T_3> .
<T_4> &apos;m <T_3> quite sure <T_0> , <T_2> we &apos;ve done <T_1> anyway .
<T_5> of the <T_1> as <T_0> large , <T_2> v@@ ar@@ ying digital <T_6> that &apos;s connected <T_4> a <T_3> .
<T_0> young scientists <T_2> down pla@@ stics <T_1> bacteria

let <T_1> give just you an <T_2> to back up <T_0> last <T_3> .
everything <T_0> everything .
so this <T_1> the first sort of <T_5> into using <T_6> in@@ sight <T_4> what <T_0> us human beings , turning it into <T_7> tool , and trying to <T_3> new <T_2> into <T_8> illness .
<T_0> &apos;s the <T_2> thing as you <T_1> see over there -- <T_4> 200 times <T_3> .
<T_0> i have <T_2> tell you , <T_6> was talking to <T_3> last <T_5> about this , that <T_1> was going to <T_4> this story .
so <T_1> asked <T_3> , can the <T_2> take <T_4> on a <T_0> new language ?
<T_3> we <T_5> , angry <T_2> attac@@ ked our tru@@ cks <T_0> st@@ oned them , by hundreds <T_1> people <T_4> over the place .

&quot; okay , great . &quot;
<T_1> was like vis@@ iting <T_0> more inno@@ cent <T_2> on <T_3> planet .

<T_0> the <T_2> would <T_1> synchr@@ oni@@ zation throughout .
<T_6> percent <T_4> what <T_1> spend on healthcare , <T_3> i said <T_0> , is <T_7> o@@ bes@@ ity , and <T_2> &apos;s going <T_5> double .
they were the <T_1> mach@@ o people i &apos;ve ever <T_3> , but <T_0> made <T_2> day .
<T_2> , you <T_1> re@@ ver@@ sed <T_0> security policy .
<T_2> the other <T_3> is : <T_4> they <T_1> they say they are to <T_0> ?
and <T_2> ste@@ pped back a little and <T_1> , you know , we ought to inv@@ est <T_3> this <T_5> , <T_6> wh@@ o@@ ever has got <T_8> most of <T_7> people working in the places is going to have <T_0> domin@@ ant position , at least in the military , and probably <T_9> all kind of economic <T_4> .
<T_4> was sitting <T_3> to someone at dinner the other day , and they were <T_6> there &apos;s <T_0> great <T_1> of the <T_5> sitting <T_7> willi@@ am <T_2> .
this <T_0> truly a <T_1> in <T_2> .
<T_2> our imagination , it <T_1> to be <T_0> .
<T_0> want <T_2> between 20 <T_1> 50 . &quot;
<T_0> you make the <T_6> , <T_7> fact , <T_1> something on <T_3> internet is going to be good <T_5> democracy , <T_2> often get <T_4> reaction .
and third , you can create <T_6> own <T_2> -- <T_9> can share them <T_1> friends , you can create <T_0> with friends -- and <T_7> &apos;s the <T_3> that i think i &apos;m most excited about because <T_8> think that at <T_4> , we are all <T_5> .
<T_2> have <T_9> that <T_3> more and <T_6> people are using the <T_5> of youtube and social net@@ working to express <T_4> stories , share <T_0> photos <T_7> tell their <T_8> stories through <T_1> own voices .
leaving <T_5> in@@ complete <T_2> it <T_6> , <T_1> gives one <T_4> feeling that there <T_3> room for <T_0> . &quot;
<T_2> , so <T_5> we analy@@ zed <T_0> structure , so <T_1> does <T_4> rel@@ ate to the <T_3> ?
the <T_2> has a <T_3> that is <T_0> for <T_1> un@@ prepared .
four <T_4> earlier , <T_7> i <T_1> one , <T_8> the cher@@ no@@ by@@ l accident , <T_0> rain came down black , and <T_2> sister &apos;s hair fell <T_3> in cl@@ um@@ ps , and <T_6> spent nine <T_5> in the <T_9> .
<T_2> &apos;s about <T_0> minutes <T_1> .
and <T_2> &apos;re <T_0> small st@@ af@@ f , which is <T_1> .
<T_1> sun is <T_0> very important <T_2> in the <T_3> for them .
i <T_0> this process &quot; <T_5> &quot; -- that is , <T_2> ten@@ den@@ cy to <T_6> meaningful <T_1> in <T_7> meaningful <T_4> meaning@@ less <T_3> .
one <T_1> is -- <T_2> need to stay away from <T_0> theater .
<T_1> want you <T_0> demand it .
and it becomes this <T_0> cycle .
it was looking like the <T_5> region , <T_8> a <T_0> , and <T_7> are <T_3> two types of me@@ als there : ste@@ ak , which stands <T_4> a mu@@ bar@@ ak , ben ali@@ -@@ type <T_6> military <T_9> di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship , <T_2> a po@@ ta@@ to , which stands for te@@ hr@@ an types <T_1> the@@ o@@ cra@@ cies .
<T_0> is <T_6> smaller of <T_1> two <T_3> , <T_5> yet it had a longer system of ra@@ il@@ ways <T_2> the <T_4> 199@@ 0s .
people &apos;s de@@ mean@@ or <T_1> when they <T_2> in <T_0> .
it <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> like it was going to <T_2> .
<T_2> ultimately , we <T_1> to <T_0> that .
<T_0> helped <T_2> k@@ ick <T_3> bri@@ ts <T_1> india .
but , you know , the thing that <T_5> gets me <T_0> these <T_6> is that most of them have been written <T_1> people that <T_7> never known themselves <T_3> on <T_4> piece of <T_2> .
<T_0> brought <T_1> hope .
<T_3> sat down <T_0> felt <T_1> blood rush down <T_6> my <T_7> , and <T_4> the he@@ at <T_2> the desert , i was free@@ zing <T_5> .
<T_1> take <T_4> , i &apos;ll take <T_3> ; we &apos;ll <T_2> have <T_0> johnson gal .
so <T_4> if <T_3> made the small@@ po@@ x <T_1> , that <T_2> itself would not cause <T_0> .
<T_3> said , &quot; these <T_4> grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; <T_5> ? &quot; the <T_1> couldn &apos;t <T_0> what was <T_2> .
and <T_0> is my <T_1> that the <T_2> in which <T_3> edu@@ cate our leaders is fundamental <T_5> progress <T_4> this <T_6> .
bro@@ c@@ col@@ i <T_1> not a chinese vegetable ; in <T_3> , <T_2> is origin@@ ally <T_4> itali@@ an <T_0> .
i <T_2> it <T_1> good <T_0> .
<T_1> have <T_2> national <T_0> radio communic@@ ations system .
now , <T_6> don &apos;t know <T_2> you think , but <T_1> think <T_8> a pretty <T_0> decision , because what <T_3> &apos;ve done is just made <T_7> permanent memor@@ ial <T_9> destruction <T_4> making it <T_5> the destruction is going to continue forever .
<T_1> walls <T_3> totally made <T_0> of comp@@ res@@ sed cla@@ y blo@@ cks from <T_2> .
this is <T_2> cosmic <T_6> that <T_0> been launched all the way <T_1> the up@@ per@@ -@@ strat@@ o@@ sphere <T_3> an <T_4> of 40 <T_5> .
<T_1> are the <T_0> conditions that create <T_2> .
<T_8> alex@@ ander , the <T_4> emp@@ ir@@ es , baby@@ l@@ on <T_9> , <T_0> into ru@@ ins , and <T_2> the tra@@ ces of the <T_1> baby@@ lon@@ ian em@@ pi@@ re are <T_6> -- until <T_3> when the cy@@ lin@@ der <T_5> discovered by a <T_7> museum exhibi@@ tion dig@@ ging in baby@@ l@@ on .
and as a <T_1> of <T_2> , <T_3> a student <T_0> , i was so inspired by that <T_4> .
and <T_4> just think that it &apos;s interesting that the idea of using re@@ al-@@ world <T_3> , <T_7> is very much something that <T_8> think would be the right thing to do , is something that scientists don &apos;t actually , <T_9> think -- <T_2> would <T_5> use a laborat@@ ory , a <T_6> im@@ perfect science of looking at the du@@ m@@ mi@@ es , than actually 30 years of data <T_1> what we &apos;ve seen with <T_0> and with car se@@ ats .
how <T_0> you <T_1> ?
<T_0> you must have <T_1> .
<T_2> got <T_3> big group of <T_0> to be in <T_1> experiment , and we <T_4> them .
where a <T_1> is <T_3> a <T_0> of average score on <T_2> things .
and <T_5> you have <T_1> most <T_2> consider <T_3> zone <T_6> peace span@@ ning 2@@ 7 countries <T_0> 450 <T_4> people .
the psych@@ o <T_0> question <T_3> , was <T_1> a <T_2> idea ?
as <T_0> was talking over <T_5> , as <T_4> sort of engaged in <T_3> , <T_1> about this , <T_2> about cities .
now , the <T_2> i <T_7> by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , <T_3> war &quot; is that we have to ac@@ knowledge that islam , as interpre@@ ted <T_8> a very , <T_5> small , <T_4> radi@@ cal group of <T_6> , was a preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a <T_9> , at one degre@@ e of re@@ move , <T_0> preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of <T_1> coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
so , <T_8> is <T_5> leg@@ acy , and i think <T_7> my call to action <T_1> all <T_6> you is : you know , think about blogs , <T_3> about <T_2> they are , think about <T_4> you &apos;ve thought of them , and then <T_9> do it , because it &apos;s something that is really going <T_0> change our lives .
<T_3> is <T_2> important as <T_0> , as <T_1> , as <T_4> environment .
<T_0> the <T_1> said , &quot; <T_3> , <T_6> it &apos;s large <T_4> , there <T_2> to be cam@@ els <T_5> . &quot;
<T_1> dr@@ or@@ i : every <T_2> has <T_0> story
<T_1> the <T_5> my <T_4> died , <T_3> was frustrated <T_2> missing these <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_0> secre@@ tary of everything <T_2> .
r@@ hin@@ o &apos;s the common <T_2> , <T_3> you <T_5> know <T_7> polio <T_6> , and <T_4> can see <T_0> these sig@@ nat@@ ures are <T_1> .
<T_3> can do <T_1> right now . <T_0> kids <T_4> co@@ w all the <T_2> .
<T_3> you can <T_2> , we <T_1> making <T_0> building together .
<T_0> took off in <T_1> . <T_4> chinese <T_2> cat@@ ching up <T_3> quickly with the united states .
and i will <T_2> on , <T_1> this <T_0> ?
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> different shape , <T_4> other <T_2> that it &apos;s the <T_0> limit@@ ation .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_3> where it is <T_1> to everything <T_0> that is .
and <T_0> they reached central <T_4> , they reached <T_1> effectively a ste@@ ppe <T_3> , a gras@@ s@@ land <T_2> .
<T_0> thin@@ ks <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
and <T_4> was writing his <T_6> one <T_5> , <T_1> his wife gave <T_0> to her baby <T_3> 25 <T_2> .
<T_2> you <T_3> to <T_1> today in <T_4> about sexual activity , you &apos;ll find pretty soon <T_5> &apos;re not <T_0> talking about sexual activity .
<T_5> can &apos;t <T_7> this without <T_4> measure of our <T_0> really changing <T_6> fa@@ te of the <T_3> in <T_1> yellow and the <T_2> .
and , it <T_1> like <T_0> c@@ and@@ y .
my <T_0> was a <T_1> .
<T_5> normally , <T_8> would be on different si@@ des of <T_7> planet <T_0> of the <T_3> , <T_6> i &apos;ve put them <T_2> because it makes things <T_4> more interesting .
finally , i want to get actually to <T_1> vision , or in fact , to <T_0> dream .
it actually <T_0> it .
<T_4> &apos;s not enough <T_8> say you have <T_7> no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates <T_2> the re@@ public of <T_0> when <T_6> girls &apos; kids are totally <T_5> there and <T_1> hope , or <T_3> no <T_9> .
<T_5> is <T_2> setting up <T_8> pul@@ l-@@ up machine at the <T_3> of his <T_7> star@@ tu@@ p <T_0> labs , where they &apos;re trying to build up other <T_4> like <T_1> month <T_6> people .
<T_2> was <T_0> running around in the back <T_1> mi@@ d-@@ summer .
because what <T_0> does is allow <T_2> conver@@ gen@@ ce like <T_1> &apos;ve never had <T_3> .
so <T_8> &apos;s reality <T_4> that if <T_5> get si@@ ck , <T_7> message is <T_2> will treat your <T_0> , and <T_6> need to <T_1> to <T_3> new way of life .
<T_7> take <T_3> on <T_5> with the <T_1> of a <T_6> share of a big se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment by a <T_2> jury , because this <T_0> really ended up <T_4> .
so now , while you &apos;re thinking <T_0> that <T_2> &apos;s move to a <T_1> task .
in the heart of this <T_8> is the <T_9> anti@@ thesis of <T_6> of these <T_0> that we &apos;ve been talking <T_2> , <T_7> i think these <T_5> some of the core <T_3> that make <T_1> proud to be <T_4> .
<T_2> she actually <T_4> these on smo@@ oth <T_0> -- two <T_7> them -- <T_1> climb <T_6> , <T_5> pull her@@ self <T_3> .
<T_2> me try <T_0> take this one step <T_1> .
in <T_1> words , maybe the pleas@@ ures of the <T_0> allow us to increase <T_2> happiness with mind-wandering .

it <T_0> hard <T_2> , often behind the <T_1> .
<T_2> said to her , &quot; you <T_0> do an <T_1> .
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> concept here <T_0> how we think this life <T_1> ability <T_3> .
<T_0> he said , &quot; do <T_1> have ga@@ ff@@ er &apos;s tape ? &quot;
and <T_0> are some of the <T_4> that -- <T_3> was <T_2> about <T_1> bur@@ nt pictures .
<T_9> set <T_8> couple of <T_3> , like <T_0> , the <T_4> ten@@ sion , den@@ sity <T_6> etc . , <T_2> then you press &quot; ex@@ ec@@ ute , &quot; and <T_1> , the universe produ@@ ces you <T_7> perfect <T_5> lens .
defin@@ itely <T_1> towards the <T_0> tar@@ get .
<T_2> anybody wants to <T_3> some s@@ lei@@ ght of hand <T_1> on , i &apos;ll be <T_0> .
<T_7> difference is this : <T_1> market economy is <T_3> tool , a valuable and <T_4> tool , <T_0> organi@@ zing productive <T_2> , but a market society <T_8> a <T_9> where almost <T_5> is up for <T_6> .
for <T_0> , what <T_5> i turn <T_1> star@@ fish by <T_2> si@@ x@@ th of a turn , and <T_3> a <T_4> of a turn ?
<T_2> &apos;re all effectively <T_1> of an extended african <T_0> .
<T_1> we have this <T_0> called <T_2> inti@@ macy .
<T_7> position of <T_1> , how <T_3> they keep <T_6> the <T_0> family , <T_5> on op@@ posite ends of the <T_2> in terms of the rich <T_4> world .
crea@@ tively <T_1> , it &apos;s just <T_0> phenomen@@ al <T_2> .
i &apos;m doing <T_4> building <T_5> swi@@ tzer@@ land , <T_0> , which <T_2> an <T_1> building for <T_3> fur@@ ni@@ ture company .
<T_0> this is <T_1> an ancient <T_2> .
think <T_0> the <T_1> to build it .
but <T_0> had <T_1> go up@@ sta@@ irs , this tiny <T_7> room that was <T_6> made out of <T_3> old <T_5> , so <T_9> was incredibly hot , <T_8> and light , and <T_4> had to lie there . <T_2> was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
<T_0> i <T_1> , go <T_2> .
<T_3> no <T_4> ever <T_1> that they <T_2> be more clo@@ sely <T_0> .
it &apos;s <T_4> the <T_2> who <T_0> to the <T_6> and <T_1> , &quot; <T_5> , it <T_3> when i do this . &quot;
but if i <T_3> ask <T_2> to do one thing , it &apos;s not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just <T_7> that , although we all understand somehow that it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able that <T_4> use our 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ po@@ und machine , which can go 60 miles an <T_6> , that can <T_1> you everywhere you want to go , and somehow it &apos;s also what <T_5> used for the last mile , <T_9> it &apos;s <T_8> , and it <T_0> &apos;t work .
<T_4> are here today <T_3> &#91; the &#93; united nations <T_0> defined <T_5> for the <T_2> of <T_1> .
now , you <T_1> ask about <T_0> kids .
so , <T_1> is <T_2> by <T_0> electro@@ magnetic force .
but <T_3> , <T_1> have a <T_0> kind of <T_2> .
<T_0> : <T_1> , then <T_2> makes it to the <T_4> paraly@@ mp@@ ics , and <T_7> &apos;s <T_6> excited . <T_8> family &apos;s <T_3> down -- <T_9> &apos;s a <T_5> deal .
<T_2> let <T_4> show you <T_0> by conver@@ ting back to <T_1> ol@@ d-@@ time digital <T_3> .
now <T_9> no@@ vel <T_5> place on a university campus <T_0> boston , so to <T_2> , it was <T_7> that there be more <T_1> characters in it <T_4> tur@@ k@@ ish characters , <T_6> i understood what <T_3> cri@@ tic was <T_8> for .
there <T_2> moments <T_3> it is <T_0> only good <T_1> you can do .
here &apos;s <T_7> pin@@ at@@ u@@ b@@ o <T_1> the early &apos; 9@@ 0s . <T_6> put a whole bunch of <T_5> in <T_0> strat@@ o@@ sphere <T_3> a <T_4> of atom@@ ic bom@@ b-@@ like <T_2> .
b@@ j : <T_5> mi@@ key also has , <T_3> his fing@@ ers , <T_0> ability to <T_6> the tail from <T_4> to <T_8> , and <T_7> and down <T_2> the <T_1> hand .
<T_3> by doing that , it allows <T_0> virus to <T_2> ran@@ dom protein <T_1> .
<T_0> gra@@ m &apos;s 8@@ 0,000 <T_3> , 8@@ 0,000 individuals are good <T_6> to control one <T_5> , 4@@ ,000 <T_1> meters , of a <T_2> p@@ lot <T_7> spider <T_9> for the whole season of <T_4> one <T_8> .
so <T_1> gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te <T_4> ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te of <T_2> , we &apos;re putting <T_0> into this <T_3> .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensor@@ s that listen to these stor@@ ms , this electrical <T_4> , and see <T_8> you can , in the same time that it takes for this stor@@ m to leave <T_1> brain and reach <T_2> legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can <T_5> these signals , <T_7> the motor messa@@ ges that are em@@ bed@@ ded in it , trans@@ late it into <T_6> comm@@ ands and send <T_0> to <T_9> artificial device that will re@@ produce the volun@@ tary motor whe@@ el of that <T_3> in real time .
these <T_2> for <T_1> temperature , <T_7> co2 and sea <T_0> were der@@ i@@ ved from ocean cor@@ es and <T_9> ice cor@@ es , from ocean se@@ di@@ ments and <T_6> that pil@@ ed <T_8> year <T_5> year over 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 years forming <T_4> two-@@ mile th@@ ick ice <T_3> .
so , in <T_3> to measure <T_6> speed <T_1> sound , <T_7> i &apos;ve got to do is <T_2> its frequ@@ ency . <T_0> , <T_4> &apos;s <T_5> .
and they were looking <T_3> the net@@ fli@@ x qu@@ eu@@ es , <T_0> they notic@@ ed <T_5> kind of funny <T_6> a lot <T_7> us probably <T_2> notic@@ ed , which <T_8> there are some movies that just sort of <T_1> right up <T_9> out to <T_4> houses .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
i want <T_1> bro@@ ther &apos;s center of the universe and <T_0> symptom@@ s and <T_5> drugs , and all of the <T_9> that interact <T_8> those , the side effects , to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we <T_3> look at in any way we want to <T_2> it , so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple <T_7> i <T_4> &apos;t even know what a medical record <T_6> .
<T_1> &apos;ve scan@@ ned about 200@@ ,000 <T_0> .
so as <T_3> said , i <T_1> bread is <T_2> trans@@ forma@@ tional <T_0> .
<T_1> are all the possible <T_8> that <T_3> can think of to <T_4> everybody in the middle <T_5> a <T_2> experience , <T_7> just <T_0> , <T_6> making music ?
you <T_2> it . <T_1> is an <T_0> problem .
well , <T_3> heart be@@ ats , <T_0> , <T_1> , <T_2> .
<T_3> you <T_0> teachers ? <T_2> you <T_1> more schools ?
so <T_1> has this self-@@ similar <T_0> .
<T_4> comp@@ res@@ sed <T_6> and other <T_3> supp@@ lies are really a lu@@ x@@ ury <T_1> can often be out of stock <T_5> months <T_0> even a <T_2> .
so it <T_2> be <T_4> to <T_1> valuable <T_3> like <T_0> for high-@@ performance batter@@ ies .
<T_3> si@@ b@@ bet from <T_7> gro@@ ve , and <T_4> ri@@ char@@ ds , from <T_6> , made <T_1> sk@@ et@@ ches that <T_2> to capture <T_5> essen@@ ce of <T_0> pres@@ enter &apos;s ideas .
<T_4> you remember <T_1> bald <T_5> , you &apos;ll <T_7> that what has been <T_8> off of <T_2> tr@@ un@@ ks in <T_3> pac@@ i@@ fic <T_9> ol@@ d-@@ growth forest is going to take <T_6> and decades to come <T_0> .

<T_4> we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another <T_1> of all of <T_0> and <T_7> actually put <T_3> back <T_6> the <T_5> of <T_2> .

and <T_0> says <T_3> &apos;s because <T_1> have a little <T_2> .

you <T_2> feel deep <T_1> to <T_5> long-term partner <T_0> you feel inten@@ se roman@@ tic <T_3> for somebody <T_9> , <T_8> you feel the <T_7> drive for people <T_6> to these <T_4> part@@ ners .
<T_2> schnei@@ der : the <T_1> spread <T_0> i@@ do@@ l tv
<T_2> are <T_1> em@@ bed@@ ded in <T_0> networks ?
<T_2> if some <T_1> is in this organi@@ zing position in <T_0> area after every <T_4> , these tools <T_3> exist .
again , i don &apos;t want to <T_6> that <T_7> kind <T_8> ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard <T_5> of interactions produ@@ ces <T_4> fac@@ tory that works <T_3> the <T_2> and <T_1> of <T_0> .
<T_3> &quot; <T_2> sho@@ ok up , &quot; <T_0> touch <T_1> not a <T_5> , but <T_4> ch@@ ill .
now the <T_2> is , <T_3> you can &apos;t <T_6> , if <T_0> stand and <T_1> out of <T_7> window on your own , <T_4> &apos;re <T_5> anti@@ social , friend@@ less <T_8> .
<T_1> part of <T_5> issue <T_7> for <T_2> -- <T_0> &apos;s here , 16 <T_4> old -- <T_3> i have permission to rela@@ y <T_6> number .
my <T_3> mother , <T_5> i just <T_2> introdu@@ ced you to <T_1> that short character <T_4> , <T_6> to <T_7> united states one thousand <T_0> ago .
<T_2> &apos;m <T_9> of <T_6> the architect <T_3> van <T_7> ro@@ he said , and i par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase , when he said that <T_0> you <T_5> to lie in <T_8> to <T_1> the <T_4> .
<T_8> because of <T_9> announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big <T_2> in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more <T_1> , and <T_3> deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of <T_5> company -- <T_7> i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and <T_4> a ro@@ und of v@@ enture capital <T_6> ra@@ mp@@ ing up <T_0> .
<T_1> those of you <T_4> the audience who <T_2> , <T_6> roll <T_0> eyes and <T_3> , y@@ up , <T_7> know <T_5> about it .
<T_3> &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of <T_4> for <T_0> to <T_2> how <T_1> use <T_5> , how we build it .
so , while i can &apos;t auto@@ matically say <T_4> britain will <T_0> to the aid of any citi@@ zen <T_8> any country , in <T_5> , <T_9> can say that britain is in a position where we &apos;re working with other countries so that this <T_3> that you have a <T_2> to protect <T_6> who <T_7> vi@@ cti@@ ms of either genoci@@ de <T_1> human@@ it@@ arian attack , is something that is accep@@ ted by the whole world .
so , several <T_4> ago , i <T_3> to <T_2> into the <T_0> and study <T_1> ma@@ dness .
<T_0> &apos;m going <T_8> go <T_2> on a limb here and <T_5> that <T_1> que@@ ens@@ land police <T_3> &apos;t have o@@ .@@ c. <T_9> , they <T_6> &apos;t have shot 2,@@ 2@@ 26 people <T_7> those two <T_4> .
<T_2> , <T_4> &apos;s really <T_1> that <T_3> use their silk completely outside <T_0> body .
<T_2> tra@@ it also <T_3> us a <T_1> about the <T_4> of groups <T_0> join .
<T_0> pac@@ ks a huge amount <T_1> data , and our <T_3> are uni@@ qu@@ ely <T_4> to <T_2> it .
and the idea was to <T_2> some self-@@ moving <T_0> in <T_1> exhibi@@ tion room <T_3>
if we <T_1> more in a <T_4> of a stupid <T_2> , <T_6> simpli@@ city <T_3> complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing <T_0> for a very <T_5> time .
now in the middle <T_2> five senses work <T_3> i suddenly <T_4> the sol@@ ar-@@ powered clo@@ cks project <T_5> <T_1> you@@ th .
<T_0> is <T_1> .
<T_1> these <T_0> all co-@@ evolved .
it leaves their <T_7> paraly@@ zed , and it dra@@ gs <T_3> families <T_4> into <T_2> , because they &apos;re <T_0> se@@ arch@@ ing and they &apos;re des@@ per@@ ately spending <T_8> little bit of <T_5> that <T_6> have , trying in va@@ in to find a <T_1> for <T_9> children .
<T_3> year &apos;s h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 threat <T_0> actually <T_1> human , a@@ vian , s@@ wine mix@@ ture that aro@@ se <T_2> mexico .
<T_2> we talked for a <T_3> minutes , <T_4> he <T_7> , &quot; <T_5> don &apos;t <T_0> tell them <T_1> you <T_6> ? &quot;
why <T_3> you <T_2> an <T_0> player from <T_1> computer company ?
so what <T_0> ?
<T_2> you ask <T_0> guy , what -- &quot; <T_9> that gli@@ t@@ ters <T_5> not gold , &quot; the <T_4> says , &quot; <T_8> , <T_6> it &apos;s <T_7> and sh@@ iny , <T_1> doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s <T_3> .
so <T_4> want to <T_0> you some <T_3> illu@@ sions , <T_5> decisi@@ on-@@ making illu@@ sions , <T_1> the <T_2> way .
i got <T_0> you &apos;re <T_1> .
what they are <T_2> an addition <T_4> ta@@ d@@ po@@ les that are <T_1> after <T_3> local bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ at <T_0> decisions affect <T_5> water <T_6> .
&quot; we <T_0> no <T_3> . <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> else who &apos;s <T_1> made <T_2> wid@@ get like this . &quot;
<T_8> it was really the beginning of <T_1> understanding <T_3> power of <T_2> , <T_6> how <T_7> we call <T_5> so <T_9> di@@ stances <T_0> from them , and makes <T_4> little .
i <T_9> &apos;t think the <T_4> is going <T_0> , because <T_5> realized <T_7> is so hard <T_1> tell the difference <T_6> a <T_3> design and something that &apos;s just part of <T_8> global <T_2> .
so it <T_6> out there <T_1> a company <T_2> the <T_9> called <T_7> who had <T_5> a <T_0> project a few <T_8> back <T_3> might just enable <T_4> approach .
<T_1> &apos;re <T_2> a sort of cosmic <T_0> .
there <T_7> come a <T_0> when we <T_1> with our <T_9> in such a way <T_4> able <T_3> run a mar@@ ath@@ on <T_6> age <T_5> will <T_8> consi@@ dered a <T_2> dis@@ ability .
<T_1> even have <T_6> arm@@ stron@@ g-@@ st@@ yle bra@@ cele@@ ts , these <T_4> bra@@ cele@@ ts , which signi@@ fy , <T_2> the <T_3> group , i <T_0> trying <T_5> main@@ tain my eating <T_7> .
john <T_5> : do you <T_9> to <T_3> what the <T_4> in drugs , <T_1> , rock &apos; <T_2> &apos; roll and <T_0> anti-@@ war <T_7> had to <T_6> with computing ? <T_8> .
<T_2> , <T_0> one &apos;s coming back <T_1> its nest .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_0> different ways <T_1> eat pizza .
so we &apos;ve talked a <T_0> about <T_1> appe@@ ar@@ ance .
<T_1> not a five-@@ minute pit@@ ch . this is , you know , <T_0> sent@@ ences .
and it turned out that <T_8> and i were both <T_5> by the same thing , which was <T_6> so much <T_9> the debate <T_1> still focused on <T_3> science and how <T_0> it was <T_4> wasn &apos;t , which , to <T_7> of us , <T_2> somewhat inten@@ tionally off point .
<T_2> : so <T_1> we started this <T_6> , <T_4> &apos;ve been getting hundreds of <T_0> , <T_8> , <T_3> calls from people <T_5> all around the <T_7> .
<T_0> time &apos;s going <T_2> because <T_1> &apos;m inside of it .
<T_2> of making fo@@ ods <T_5> look <T_1> things that you wouldn &apos;t eat , we decided <T_3> make ingredients <T_4> like <T_6> that <T_0> know .
this <T_5> to me both <T_1> deeply <T_2> and a <T_4> re-@@ statement of <T_3> belief about <T_0> .
the <T_1> of the <T_0> . <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> drive .
then <T_1> got a <T_0> .
mar@@ cus : <T_2> i <T_1> what <T_0> like ?
<T_2> &apos;s like taking <T_4> out of <T_3> bur@@ ning <T_8> , treating them for <T_0> in@@ hal@@ ation and <T_1> them back <T_9> the <T_6> , because <T_5> oil is still <T_7> .
so , soon <T_1> my arri@@ val , i had <T_4> something which <T_2> had already <T_6> ; that <T_3> instru@@ ments come <T_0> the <T_8> of <T_5> europe , <T_7> .
<T_3> really have <T_4> be journ@@ ali@@ sts , you have to be invent@@ ors , <T_2> have to <T_1> your imagination more importantly <T_0> anything .
i <T_0> one guy who &apos;s <T_2> $ 4@@ ,000 just <T_1> photo@@ shop over the <T_3> .
<T_8> i <T_4> , <T_6> go <T_2> and <T_0> up other industri@@ es , and i think , you know , <T_5> do <T_3> differently <T_9> i think <T_1> industri@@ es are not quite the same as a result of <T_7> attac@@ king the market .
<T_0> even <T_1> you &apos;ve had <T_3> with somebody for a very <T_8> time , <T_7> &apos;t you <T_2> things like <T_5> &quot; should we <T_6> the usual <T_4> &quot;
now <T_0> &apos;ve <T_5> seen <T_1> sha@@ do@@ w like this of a <T_3> hole , <T_8> black <T_4> can <T_6> heard , <T_2> if <T_7> &apos;re not seen .
the <T_4> is 1993 and he was working on <T_2> book and <T_6> was working on a <T_3> to help <T_9> kind <T_0> explain <T_7> we were all <T_8> and <T_1> to popul@@ ari@@ ze all <T_5> .
turn them on their <T_4> , comb@@ ine them so that <T_3> look like a tree <T_2> the <T_5> at the bottom <T_1> the bran@@ ches <T_0> up .
<T_4> put <T_2> on the <T_5> , atta@@ ch them to <T_0> , <T_3> kids <T_1> bought in here .
i <T_5> out <T_0> ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke <T_3> and <T_2> di@@ ving in the <T_4> and became a <T_1> ec@@ ologist over@@ night .
well <T_1> day i <T_3> walking <T_5> union square , <T_2> i saw this <T_4> , <T_0> had just been <T_6> in 200@@ 5 .
you &apos;re <T_2> . <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_0> didn &apos;t ?
<T_0> he drives <T_1> very nice <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s swi@@ mm@@ ing down <T_0> a@@ venue <T_4> he <T_2> gets to the <T_1> .
so it &apos;s poin@@ ting away <T_1> the display , <T_0> poin@@ ting at the display .
<T_0> &apos;s got <T_1> in it .
so <T_2> sign@@ al-@@ to-@@ noise ra@@ ti@@ o then pres@@ ents <T_0> with a patter@@ n-@@ dete@@ ction <T_1> .
we &apos;ve got <T_3> , bu@@ ff@@ ets <T_0> radio waves , <T_2> and <T_1> .
and so <T_8> i &apos;m going to <T_7> you is <T_6> three-@@ minute <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> version of the first aspe@@ ct of <T_5> film that <T_3> produced . it &apos;s an on@@ going <T_9> that &apos;s going to go another <T_2> or five <T_0> .
<T_9> when <T_2> became , <T_8> , a hot top@@ ic -- if <T_5> may make the <T_6> -- <T_1> the last <T_7> years , this <T_4> so un@@ -@@ pc , we <T_3> &apos;t talk <T_0> it .
so what <T_4> discovery of <T_5> writers did for <T_0> was this : <T_1> sa@@ ved me from <T_2> a <T_6> story <T_7> what <T_3> are .
it quickly <T_0> .
our <T_1> are <T_2> and <T_3> want to teach them how to <T_0> and <T_4> .
and <T_1> found <T_6> if <T_3> friend <T_5> ob@@ ese , <T_7> incre@@ ases your risk of o@@ bes@@ ity <T_0> about 5@@ 7 <T_4> in the <T_2> given time period .
thank you .
<T_6> offici@@ ally took a <T_2> from <T_4> , and i <T_8> to the <T_1> clin@@ ic to be re@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ated <T_7> the <T_0> time in <T_3> years , <T_5> transplant .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> very important <T_0> to bring <T_2> together .
<T_5> then when they <T_2> , i <T_3> inf@@ late that number <T_1> ballo@@ ons <T_4> give <T_6> that number of <T_0> to hold .

perfect .
now , it &apos;s quite an <T_2> phenomen@@ on ; <T_0> was <T_1> 100 years ago .
<T_1> you know <T_2> they have <T_0> design ?
<T_9> then <T_0> looked to <T_1> future and <T_3> that , in <T_5> , if <T_6> world were <T_2> fil@@ led with <T_8> , there <T_7> be an@@ arch@@ y <T_4> chaos .
<T_1> spac@@ es may distur@@ b <T_0> .
we <T_9> through some <T_8> appar@@ at@@ uses ; <T_1> collect <T_7> the <T_3> of a billion <T_5> from just <T_2> day <T_4> on top of a <T_0> in new <T_6> city .
just consider <T_2> : five <T_3> ni@@ ghts have been <T_5> on <T_1> in <T_4> past <T_0> months alone .
<T_0> famous <T_9> ma@@ ster rum@@ i , who is very well known to most of <T_6> , has a story in which he talks <T_3> a <T_7> who goes to the house <T_4> a friend , and he kno@@ cks on <T_1> door , <T_5> a voice <T_8> , &quot; who &apos;s <T_2> ? &quot;
<T_3> said , &quot; god <T_0> bread . <T_5> &apos;s <T_2> . god <T_1> bread . <T_6> know what <T_4> wants . &quot;
everyone <T_1> into <T_3> . <T_0> was <T_2> .
&quot; don &apos;t <T_1> us any <T_0> that self-@@ actu@@ alization stuff .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> big issue .
so as <T_8> are facing all <T_5> multiple <T_0> in our world at the moment , what is <T_6> for <T_4> on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more <T_1> , gra@@ titude , <T_3> in our lives and be the best for <T_2> own <T_7> is also what is <T_9> for the world .
and that too <T_0> relatively new idea <T_1>
<T_4> doesn &apos;t it sm@@ ell of <T_0> or <T_3> ? well , <T_1> are really <T_2> theor@@ ies .
and <T_1> , <T_4> of the <T_2> are treat@@ able , two of <T_0> actually <T_3> .
<T_5> i <T_6> , <T_1> , <T_8> would <T_7> make a big <T_0> , if <T_3> could do it , and so i <T_2> , &quot; <T_9> , let &apos;s <T_4> at it . &quot;
but <T_8> , <T_7> &apos;ve been <T_3> whether it might be possible to take <T_4> of <T_0> in@@ sight , to actually <T_1> ways to <T_9> the world , to do <T_6> better , to actually <T_2> things , not just <T_5> things .
this is <T_0> the place <T_2> hate and <T_1> .
with <T_2> in mind , we <T_1> a completely <T_4> robotic system to <T_3> the rat <T_0> any direction of <T_5> .
<T_2> a little bit <T_3> , why they have <T_4> gla@@ ze on <T_0> thing they <T_1> a thal@@ i .
he <T_4> , &quot; <T_7> investig@@ ations <T_5> fire@@ figh@@ ters often inclu@@ de &apos; we didn &apos;t <T_6> the <T_3> was going to do <T_2> , &apos; <T_0> when all of the available <T_1> was there to <T_8> safe <T_9> . &quot;
of course , they &apos;re all <T_2> to <T_0> in <T_1> .
and <T_6> you &apos;ve been <T_4> that part <T_3> the country , this <T_1> what <T_7> pil@@ es of <T_0> , <T_5> coal waste <T_2> like .
<T_0> gave <T_1> their name .
<T_1> paul ni@@ ck@@ lin <T_2> to <T_3> to shoot <T_0> story <T_4> le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als .
i &apos;ve <T_3> to move that <T_0> across , <T_2> only a <T_1> .
and the <T_7> why they <T_5> to go under@@ ground is that , if you did this experiment <T_1> the surface <T_2> the earth , the same experiment would be s@@ w@@ am@@ ped by <T_6> that could be created <T_4> things <T_8> cosmic rays , ambi@@ ent radio activity , even our own bodies . you might not believe it , <T_0> even our own bodies are <T_3> enough to distur@@ b <T_9> experiment .
and if <T_0> look <T_1> a compar@@ ison , on the <T_7> , we see <T_4> volu@@ metri@@ c <T_2> gives us and on the <T_5> you see <T_3> mark@@ ers <T_6> us .
if <T_9> take the <T_0> between <T_3> two images <T_6> , you <T_4> get <T_2> image <T_8> from <T_7> entire sphere of <T_1> of just the shine off of <T_5> &apos;s skin .

and the rich people moved <T_8> the upper <T_2> and left <T_0> po@@ or@@ er people <T_6> the <T_4> cities , about <T_9> to 12 <T_7> of the <T_5> have moved to <T_3> upper <T_1> .

they &apos;re the ones you find <T_0> the <T_1> .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> i &apos;m giving you <T_2> data about <T_1> .
now , <T_4> &apos;m going to give <T_2> some <T_1> up here , <T_3> , right <T_0> .

we &apos;ve also along the way discovered that <T_6> is a very <T_0> molecule , <T_7> all of the <T_2> in <T_5> body has been around <T_3> , since <T_4> beginning of us , of us as <T_1> .

<T_2> &apos;re going to have -- -- <T_1> &apos;re going to have to live closer <T_0> where we work .
thank you .
<T_9> , as <T_0> of — i &apos;m <T_7> it &apos;s <T_5> a stadium wave , <T_3> we &apos;re going to start <T_2> this <T_8> of the room on the <T_4> of <T_1> , and <T_6> over to here .
<T_3> all of <T_0> construction of reality is <T_2> these limited <T_1> .

two <T_0> to <T_3> or <T_1> end <T_2> .
and so <T_6> we also <T_1> was <T_2> whatever <T_4> did <T_5> couldn &apos;t do a <T_3> adver@@ t for <T_0> .
and <T_1> rad@@ cli@@ ffe <T_3> that <T_0> says , &quot; <T_2> &apos;m <T_4> . go . &quot;

not <T_1> . <T_0> i .
<T_2> what they did was <T_0> us <T_1> play .
and <T_1> were testing if <T_3> mi@@ ce would <T_2> self-@@ ad@@ minister <T_0> .
it <T_3> a quite <T_1> experiment -- <T_9> we <T_2> took the synthetic <T_7> of dna , in@@ je@@ cted it <T_4> the bacteria and all of a <T_8> , that <T_5> started driving the <T_6> of the virus particles that turned around <T_0> then killed the bacteria .
<T_2> also de@@ plo@@ yed <T_0> couple of satellite ta@@ gs , <T_1> we did use hi@@ -@@ tech <T_3> as well .
that <T_1> is already <T_0> if you &apos;re a <T_2> .

<T_5> &apos;ve figured out an <T_3> location of <T_6> satellite <T_4> the planet <T_0> a <T_1> location on <T_2> ground .
thank you .
if <T_3> make the <T_1> as <T_0> as <T_4> , i get to <T_2> limit <T_5> min@@ imum amount of paper needed .
is <T_1> nuclear <T_2> ? <T_0> know we have that .
<T_0> was designed <T_4> that machine , <T_3> the <T_1> behind <T_2> institute .
a <T_1> to me was how we <T_3> express <T_0> new <T_2> order <T_4> a colum@@ n .
<T_1> their body language <T_0> great .
first of all , we have all the stati@@ st@@ ical analy@@ ses from the <T_9> project work , where we <T_6> that we have , what , 250 , 2@@ 80 docum@@ ented <T_3> now where people have been wr@@ ong@@ fully convi@@ cted and sub@@ sequ@@ ently <T_8> , some from death row , <T_2> the <T_5> of later dna analysis , and you know <T_1> over three quar@@ ters of all of <T_7> cases of ex@@ on@@ er@@ ation involved <T_0> e@@ ye@@ witness identifi@@ cation te@@ stim@@ ony during the <T_4> that convi@@ cted them .
<T_0> you feel a <T_2> of moral <T_1> ?

and <T_3> wonder is <T_0> what has created the <T_2> cities , <T_5> greatest <T_4> that <T_1> have had .
an <T_0> to match every <T_1> .
<T_8> don &apos;t know why national <T_0> has done this , <T_9> &apos;ve <T_2> done this before , <T_3> they &apos;re <T_1> me to show you a few <T_6> from a <T_4> that <T_5> &apos;ve just <T_7> that is not published yet .

<T_1> &apos;m much more trying to <T_2> to some of <T_0> questions we &apos;re talking about .
my <T_3> is : <T_1> many <T_4> those <T_2> are actually going to matter in the <T_0> run ?
<T_4> are feeding our kids antibio@@ tics <T_0> bee@@ f <T_2> other <T_3> protein every <T_1> .

<T_6> then <T_3> &apos;s this <T_5> : &quot; <T_4> there &apos;s gr@@ ass <T_1> the <T_0> , <T_2> ball . &quot;
it &apos;s <T_2> to be very <T_0> to deal <T_1> .
<T_2> it is <T_3> our self-@@ interest <T_1> understand the topo@@ graphy of <T_0> lives <T_4> ourselves .

i was also <T_1> by another <T_3> that i had , again , when <T_0> was in <T_5> , <T_2> i moved <T_4> stanford .

<T_1> i come up , and i say , &quot; <T_6> am i going to do <T_2> ? &quot; <T_0> &apos;m <T_3> going to <T_7> what i <T_4> to do , and <T_8> put <T_5> into <T_9> pan@@ ic .
<T_1> , <T_2> god , is <T_3> what <T_0> do .
how <T_0> i <T_1> know ?
<T_1> we use the physical simulation of the <T_9> , use artificial intelligence , put that artificial intelligence into <T_4> character , drive virtual <T_2> , <T_7> the way <T_8> jump@@ s off the da@@ m , and then sky@@ di@@ ve <T_3> , <T_0> have him cau@@ ght <T_6> a <T_5> afterwards ?
<T_1> also makes sense in <T_2> strong <T_0> .
<T_1> mother wanted <T_0> to be a <T_2> .
<T_1> it takes place <T_5> an <T_0> called the <T_2> in what <T_4> now <T_3> .
these <T_3> , <T_2> are cheap . <T_5> , <T_6> means <T_0> &apos;ve got to spend more <T_4> sor@@ ting through <T_1> .

now <T_3> u@@ ph@@ ill <T_0> for ghana <T_7> for <T_8> is not <T_9> , but <T_5> have <T_4> that the <T_1> side of democracy exists , and that <T_2> must not take it for <T_6> .
this is <T_1> only a <T_6> in <T_7> and where <T_4> shor@@ eline <T_2> , <T_3> is a change in the <T_5> of the <T_0> of this region .
they <T_1> a lot of <T_2> , a <T_0> of carbon , <T_3> we want to <T_4> .
<T_2> now , we &apos;re <T_3> , as i &apos;ve just <T_4> , we &apos;re hit@@ ting <T_0> third <T_1> point .
<T_4> &apos;s an <T_3> second ad@@ ult <T_1> that &apos;s been ad@@ ded <T_2> our <T_0> .
so it <T_2> see its <T_1> , <T_4> then it can <T_0> its environment and <T_3> .
<T_0> has happened with <T_1> revolution .
<T_3> think <T_1> can one-@@ up the <T_2> and <T_0> something .
also around this <T_3> , <T_2> home , <T_1> was the <T_4> that people <T_0> buying .
so , you click <T_1> on <T_0> als ta@@ b there .
now , <T_3> does <T_0> brow@@ ne give you for <T_2> 7@@ 00 <T_1> ?
and <T_1> kept <T_0> going .
do you understand ?

that <T_2> has <T_0> , but <T_3> doesn &apos;t actually re@@ fer <T_7> specific chemicals because <T_1> chemicals come in <T_6> lot <T_5> different shapes and <T_4> .

<T_1> you <T_0> it go ?
they &apos;re <T_0> saying <T_1> in america , that middle <T_3> should be re@@ gar@@ ded as up to age <T_2> .
<T_2> if <T_4> believe <T_6> &apos;re <T_8> than <T_0> other guy , well that means <T_3> we &apos;re more <T_7> to get that pro@@ motion , to re@@ main <T_1> , because <T_5> &apos;re more <T_9> , more interesting .
and <T_0> years <T_1> , <T_2> same a@@ ward came to est@@ on@@ ia .
<T_2> guy <T_4> je@@ ff <T_3> has found <T_0> way to have a self-@@ assem@@ bl@@ ing co@@ ding <T_1> .
like <T_5> . and <T_2> we get a <T_0> faster and a <T_4> faster <T_1> a <T_3> faster .
<T_0> travel all over the <T_3> taking <T_4> -- <T_1> of them good , <T_5> of them <T_2> .
you know in 19@@ 50 <T_1> typical <T_2> car@@ ried 5,000 <T_3> 10,000 tons <T_0> of goo@@ ds .
they &apos;re <T_0> integra@@ l <T_1> of the <T_2> .
<T_1> car@@ ed in a very <T_0> man@@ ner , <T_2> it <T_3> a <T_4> of time to <T_5> that .
now , in america , in fact , <T_0> cannot give up <T_2> right <T_1> trial by <T_3> .
<T_2> they take <T_0> dirty she@@ ets down <T_3> the <T_1> .
<T_3> said , &quot; because <T_5> heard <T_0> built <T_7> center <T_4> i didn &apos;t <T_2> that <T_1> did it , and i wanted <T_6> see for myself .
but it <T_0> be an <T_2> -- <T_1> .
by the way , this <T_3> is pretty <T_0> of <T_4> the <T_1> took place , you know , <T_5> four <T_2> ago .
and <T_0> el <T_1> .
so <T_0> , this <T_4> in each other , knowing <T_2> without a dou@@ bt and practic@@ ing that every day <T_3> whatever you do , <T_8> &apos;s what <T_6> believe <T_1> change <T_9> world and make tomorrow <T_7> than <T_5> .
<T_0> they ad@@ ded two <T_1> compon@@ ents .
<T_8> little <T_9> on the foot@@ pla@@ te , by the way , to <T_6> ri@@ der means there &apos;s something <T_3> on underneath it -- <T_5> this case , a <T_0> chain running <T_4> 300 <T_1> and hour probably , <T_2> the power from the <T_7> .
as you heard <T_2> the <T_0> , anywhere <T_1> , not <T_3> .
and <T_4> think <T_0> of <T_6> i &apos;m learning in <T_5> process is <T_3> one must <T_1> on@@ es@@ el@@ f <T_2> feel g@@ rief .
<T_1> actually ro@@ tat@@ ing <T_2> stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed right to stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed <T_4> , main@@ ta@@ ining that <T_3> as <T_0> as possible <T_5>

and <T_1> your <T_5> is fail@@ ing at <T_4> bad <T_3> about the <T_0> , <T_7> will constantly leave <T_2> ro@@ se@@ -@@ tin@@ ted <T_6> on .
the <T_2> apo@@ logi@@ zed <T_0> said <T_4> never r@@ uns <T_1> of <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> more of it .
now let me <T_0> clear . i &apos;m not <T_1> the <T_2> here .
<T_2> we put <T_1> back in <T_3> thr@@ one of the king of be@@ a@@ sts in tasman@@ ia where it bel@@ on@@ gs , restore <T_0> ecosystem ?
li@@ ke@@ wise , for the <T_0> stars , or <T_2> contr@@ ast , <T_3> young stars , they just <T_1> not be <T_4> .
<T_0> grand@@ in : because <T_2> do you think made <T_3> first <T_1> spe@@ ars ?
<T_0> said , &quot; <T_1> have <T_3> me to <T_2> .
and as soon as <T_0> cr@@ ab@@ s tou@@ ched <T_1> arm , it <T_2> lights out .
<T_8> acting <T_4> nothing but a <T_0> of multiple person@@ alities , believ@@ ing <T_1> own <T_5> are <T_3> , <T_7> in <T_6> school <T_9> kenn@@ y telling me <T_2> wanted to be a co@@ p .
and <T_1> , <T_2> , is a <T_0> .
<T_0> it <T_1> critical for <T_5> ir@@ ani@@ ans <T_2> remember <T_7> great past , their <T_3> past <T_6> they f@@ ought <T_4> and won .
and <T_4> ti@@ ling units , i <T_2> so that <T_6> would con@@ tain parts <T_8> <T_1> within their shapes so <T_7> i could then join those pieces <T_3> to create <T_5> <T_0> then words within the abstra@@ ct <T_9> .
the first is if anything is unique about this <T_5> , it &apos;s less the science than the <T_7> -- that this for us <T_0> a <T_3> experiment , an experiment in what would happen <T_2> we were as <T_9> and <T_1> at the <T_8> phase <T_4> discovery chemistry research as we could <T_6> .
she <T_3> a decision <T_6> to go and get a ra@@ z@@ or <T_4> a glass sh@@ ard , <T_2> her <T_1> to stop@@ ping that <T_5> to <T_7> girls .
right ? we &apos;ve created <T_5> professional class of <T_3> whose goal <T_6> to go out and photograph <T_0> mer@@ ma@@ id par@@ ade , <T_7> whatever <T_2> they &apos;re <T_4> out to <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s 2@@ 3 . she &apos;s been on <T_3> ever <T_0> she <T_1> 13 .
<T_3> , i &apos;ll show you <T_2> of the <T_1> , <T_0> of which were self-@@ organi@@ zed by the <T_4> themselves .
so how <T_2> we pro@@ ce@@ ed <T_0> our qu@@ est <T_3> happiness ? very <T_1> , we look <T_4> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> , <T_4> tell <T_1> they &apos;re from <T_2> &apos;s .
<T_5> of these would have been great <T_2> to <T_0> , <T_3> my nur@@ ses <T_1> no <T_4> .
and this <T_2> is within all the <T_0> for each <T_1> .
and then <T_0> mothers tell <T_4> , &quot; care@@ ful <T_1> don &apos;t <T_5> down &quot; -- <T_3> you &apos;ll fall <T_2> .
<T_2> multi@@ pli@@ ed . <T_1> emer@@ ged , <T_4> shaped <T_0> l@@ ure <T_3> ...
&quot; <T_1> &quot; is <T_3> collabor@@ ation <T_2> ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ er <T_0> ob@@ arz@@ an@@ ek .
giving up the <T_8> -- for that &apos;s how it felt , it felt <T_1> giving up -- meant giving up <T_3> only his life <T_7> also our <T_5> , <T_9> story of us as <T_6> , <T_4> story of us as inv@@ inci@@ ble , and for <T_2> doctors , the story of themselves <T_0> heal@@ ers .
in other <T_3> , <T_1> can <T_0> him <T_2> her .
and what <T_1> found is <T_5> most <T_2> and <T_4> follow a <T_3> for success , which is this : if <T_0> work harder , i &apos;ll be more <T_6> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_6> much <T_5> , you <T_2> &apos;t afford to <T_1> or <T_3> water in <T_0> country that way .
so <T_3> my <T_5> , i <T_2> that <T_0> is hard , <T_4> are fil@@ led with <T_1> .
and there <T_4> people <T_5> think <T_1> families <T_2> mine shouldn &apos;t be <T_3> to <T_0> .
so <T_0> our <T_5> was to get the <T_2> economy down <T_1> 150 percent <T_6> 100 percent of <T_3> earth &apos;s capacity , we <T_4> do that .
so <T_1> open for <T_3> experience that <T_5> change you is <T_4> first <T_2> we <T_0> to embra@@ ce .
<T_1> mean , if you <T_2> talk it , <T_3> mo@@ ck@@ ing@@ bird can <T_0> it .
let &apos;s get <T_1> brain <T_0> to get busy and <T_3> out <T_2> it <T_4> in the brain .
<T_1> i <T_0> &apos;t the <T_2> one .
<T_2> have made these <T_0> of devices using <T_3> and <T_4> paper and wra@@ ps , <T_5> all <T_1> of stuff .
<T_0> have to present <T_2> in digital <T_3> in a similar <T_4> that you would in your <T_1> life .
but <T_0> personal <T_5> of these ones , i have to <T_1> , does actually come <T_4> the united states : &quot; offic@@ ers tas@@ er <T_3> year-old dis@@ ab@@ led woman <T_6> her <T_2> . &quot;
charles <T_2> : <T_0> that <T_1> across oceans
so <T_0> is <T_1> surprising .
for <T_0> , at <T_4> now for almost <T_6> years , <T_5> has <T_8> been a <T_9> where there <T_7> more exc@@ it@@ ement <T_3> the <T_2> that lies in <T_1> of us .
<T_2> &apos;ve fund@@ ed <T_3> that <T_7> that we <T_1> double global pal@@ m oil production without cu@@ tting <T_4> single tree <T_5> the next 20 years , and do it <T_9> in <T_0> alone <T_8> plan@@ ting on land that &apos;s already <T_6> .
<T_2> i &apos;m just <T_0> to read one of <T_1> to you .
any one of <T_5> who <T_4> taken someone else &apos;s job , or <T_0> to give yours to <T_9> else , no matter <T_3> deta@@ iled the <T_7> , you <T_1> trans@@ mit what <T_2> know , what <T_8> will intu@@ it under a <T_6> set of cir@@ cum@@ stances .
so we <T_1> to use <T_0> one car@@ efully .
afterwards , <T_3> played a <T_0> tra@@ ck underneath <T_1> that the sing@@ ers would have <T_2> to <T_4> to .
with <T_2> whole sort of su@@ ite <T_4> policies , we could <T_3> reduce our <T_1> consumption -- or <T_5> oil consumption -- by <T_0> percent by <T_6> .
just <T_1> with the number <T_3> planets there are <T_0> our <T_2> .
<T_3> are <T_0> aw@@ ful <T_1> of <T_4> that you &apos;d like to <T_2> among .
<T_1> , the <T_0> part <T_8> that , soon after -- and i was <T_3> to <T_7> allen ; <T_5> saw <T_2> in the audience , and i <T_6> him <T_4> copy <T_9> &quot; rare earth . &quot;
here &apos;s what it <T_1> like <T_0> 2000 .
<T_0> the <T_2> few years , <T_4> of <T_1> will be the proud <T_3> of a gps dot .
it &apos;s no different <T_0> che@@ cking an email .
it <T_0> peac@@ eful <T_1> violent .
and <T_2> are affected by <T_1> rules <T_0> .
speaking <T_9> li@@ ft 2007 , sug@@ ata mit@@ ra talks about his <T_1> in <T_3> wall <T_6> . young <T_5> in this project figured out how to use a pc on their own -- and then <T_4> other kids . <T_7> as@@ ks , what <T_0> can <T_2> teach <T_8> ?
you can <T_0> it &apos;s pretty much <T_1> .
fast <T_7> three <T_4> . i did eventually <T_2> off the <T_1> , and start plan@@ ning another <T_0> . this time , i <T_9> to go right across , on my own this time , from <T_5> , at the top of the <T_8> , to the north pole , where the sort of kin@@ k in the middle <T_6> , and then on to <T_3> .
how <T_1> more she reve@@ als <T_2> her gl@@ are of ink <T_0> she <T_3> .
did <T_1> say that ? <T_0> guess i did .
but it <T_2> out there was a <T_3> twi@@ st to <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
so <T_2> idea is <T_3> create <T_8> object able to <T_0> the <T_6> , <T_9> to be in cont@@ act at <T_7> right <T_4> at the right <T_1> , in all the <T_5> parts of the plant .
<T_4> in <T_2> bar@@ rage of noise <T_3> i &apos;m <T_0> out , i <T_1> live an <T_5> an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous and private <T_6> .
now with the allo@@ cation <T_4> the understanding of the <T_9> of understanding , we enter into a <T_6> er@@ a of science in which <T_8> feel nothing <T_0> than so much so as to say that <T_1> within themselves , <T_3> or non-@@ com@@ por@@ ary , will <T_7> figure into the folding of our non-@@ understanding and our par@@ tial understanding to <T_5> networks <T_2> which we all draw our source and conclu@@ sions from .
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> little <T_0> system , <T_1> we pull away from our mel@@ ted <T_3> here .
<T_0> think we &apos;re going <T_4> end up , <T_2> the next <T_1> years , <T_6> understand <T_8> kinds of brain mechan@@ is@@ ms <T_7> pull us <T_5> one person <T_3> another .

it &apos;s <T_3> difficult to <T_2> , especially <T_1> the <T_0> .
<T_5> then we do <T_8> other very important <T_3> that kind of <T_1> fill in <T_6> feedback <T_2> : we help <T_7> understand in a little <T_0> what these <T_9> are and what they <T_4> indi@@ cate .

and it la@@ y precisely in that in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able curi@@ osity , that <T_7> desire to know , no <T_4> what the subject , <T_0> matter what the cost , even at a time when <T_3> ke@@ e@@ pers of the do@@ om@@ s@@ day <T_1> are willing to bet even money <T_5> the human race won &apos;t be around to imagine anything <T_9> the year <T_8> , a <T_2> 9@@ 3 <T_6> from now .
the <T_3> of today has <T_4> the <T_2> economy <T_0> the <T_1> during the first world war .
<T_2> is just one <T_5> , so <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> meaning to say <T_0> where <T_4> is .
just looked <T_0> the <T_1> of california <T_2> me .
now what we <T_3> to <T_5> is the mental arti@@ ll@@ ery <T_0> we have <T_9> up over those <T_4> years , <T_8> i think again that another <T_2> will <T_6> us <T_7> , and that &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_0> : she hit <T_1> .
and <T_0> started <T_2> at me , <T_4> i <T_1> to the <T_5> , &quot; <T_8> , tell <T_3> to <T_7> down , what is <T_6> saying ? &quot;
<T_0> , <T_1> . the <T_2> way .
if <T_0> come to cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , you <T_5> probably see an <T_2> by ai wei@@ we@@ i <T_3> the <T_4> artist <T_1>
if your <T_5> gro@@ ws with four <T_1> , you <T_6> to <T_0> child mortality four <T_9> ; <T_3> it &apos;s used <T_4> and people are <T_2> involved <T_8> can get the use of the resources in <T_7> way they want it .
anyway , <T_2> , you <T_1> help <T_0> out here , <T_3> you wouldn &apos;t <T_4> .
so it <T_1> be a <T_0> thing .
how many would <T_2> in <T_1> of <T_0> martin ?
the <T_0> is <T_2> : that <T_1> is not <T_3> a nation@@ -@@ state .
if you &apos;re trying to influ@@ ence <T_6> to <T_7> their <T_2> , with <T_9> to producing pollu@@ tan@@ ts , one <T_5> , the <T_3> approach , is to ex@@ h@@ ort them to be <T_8> , to <T_1> to them <T_0> damage they &apos;re doing to <T_4> planet .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> future ?
so <T_0> started to consider what <T_1> should do , <T_5> i thought , <T_2> wanted to make my <T_7> better , and <T_3> show on@@ stage how <T_4> the yo@@ -@@ yo could <T_9> to <T_8> the public &apos;s image of <T_6> yo@@ -@@ yo .
it <T_0> be <T_2> that <T_1> talk about <T_3> 100 years .
<T_2> it <T_5> worth it , <T_0> we <T_1> it in a <T_6> capture device , brought it up <T_3> the lab on <T_7> ship , and then <T_8> on this <T_4> lights up .
<T_6> this <T_4> where it gets really <T_1> , because it &apos;s not <T_0> simple , <T_3> we <T_5> not <T_2> .
<T_5> &quot; done this <T_6> &quot; is starting <T_2> enter@@ prise and <T_0> value , and taking <T_4> from <T_1> to <T_3> .
and <T_1> show <T_3> for really what <T_0> are , <T_2> they &apos;re made of .
&quot; i <T_0> s@@ as@@ sy . &quot;
of course , what happens <T_0> they eat the <T_1> chi@@ ps ?
<T_4> you look <T_2> the regi@@ stry , <T_5> , a <T_1> of the regi@@ ster@@ ed <T_3> in <T_0> e.@@ u .

now <T_1> com <T_3> &apos;s later , we hear a <T_4> message : &quot; this <T_0> be won <T_2> .

and <T_2> are <T_0> of <T_1> pen@@ gu@@ ins &apos; main bre@@ eding is@@ lands .

<T_1> &apos;re going to move the <T_0> according to that over and over <T_2> .
<T_4> it &apos;s how we <T_3> b@@ end the <T_5> of <T_6> down towards zero , just <T_1> the <T_2> that we <T_0> work .
these sau@@ sa@@ ge-@@ shaped <T_1> are the <T_2> , and we &apos;ll focus <T_0> them .

this kind of <T_5> is mind-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , and <T_3> direct impli@@ cations for <T_2> only the inc@@ enti@@ ves <T_9> farmers <T_7> inv@@ est in <T_6> produ@@ ctivity technology , such <T_0> modern seeds and <T_4> , <T_1> also direct impli@@ cations <T_8> food security .
and <T_0> don &apos;t want to let <T_1> in .
<T_2> things would <T_0> down from above all through the wee@@ k@@ end of rocket laun@@ ch <T_1> rocket laun@@ ch <T_3> rocket laun@@ ch .
and about <T_3> or <T_0> hours later , <T_2> said we <T_4> go <T_1> .
and <T_1> you have <T_0> .
i mean , this was <T_0> .
<T_5> human evolution , multiple <T_2> of humans co-@@ exi@@ sted . could we be mi@@ d-@@ up@@ grade now ? at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z <T_0> across time <T_7> space to bring us <T_8> the <T_3> moment -- <T_1> shows <T_6> technology is reve@@ aling evidence <T_9> sugge@@ sts rapid evolution may <T_4> under way .
but <T_1> turns <T_4> that <T_0> phenomen@@ on of <T_2> has actually been very , very well studied <T_3>
those <T_1> are difficult <T_0> change .
<T_1> was part of <T_4> sort of background noise of the <T_3> of <T_2> , completely <T_0> .
<T_5> classi@@ fy breast den@@ sity <T_2> four <T_4> based on <T_0> appe@@ ar@@ ance <T_3> the tissue on <T_1> mammo@@ gra@@ m .
<T_1> , i &apos;m not going to talk <T_0> that .
<T_6> , there were <T_2> , such as <T_4> given to <T_9> har@@ ris@@ on <T_8> the 18@@ th century , for solving <T_7> so@@ -@@ called lon@@ g@@ itu@@ de problem , but pri@@ zes <T_1> only <T_3> after the fact , <T_0> they <T_5> given at all .
so we <T_1> to do <T_4> massive set <T_5> calcu@@ lations and <T_3> producing green <T_2> for <T_0> and its <T_6> .
<T_6> there &apos;s lessons to learn , and there &apos;s lessons <T_1> learn from <T_0> exception , the exception that <T_5> know very well today <T_2> the disco@@ ver@@ ies we &apos;ve made , and many <T_4> sch@@ ol@@ ars have made around the <T_3> .
you <T_6> know that , so far in <T_1> the da@@ wn of this <T_9> , <T_2> know <T_8> there are perhaps 4@@ 0,000 unique mu@@ tations <T_0> more than 10,000 genes , and <T_4> are 500 of <T_3> genes that <T_5> bon@@ a-@@ fi@@ de dri@@ vers <T_7> caus@@ es of cancer .
and <T_1> don &apos;t <T_3> ask about those <T_0> because there &apos;s nothing <T_2> can do .
but <T_6> average <T_2> all these studies came <T_1> -- <T_0> mean is about 5,000 , <T_8> i personally don &apos;t <T_5> , <T_7> then i <T_3> a <T_4> .
<T_0> : what <T_2> didn &apos;t <T_1> you was -- <T_3> got that s@@ w@@ inging <T_4> going ?
so it &apos;s taken me <T_2> a <T_1> to <T_3> access into <T_0> places .
in the <T_6> , i went to speak <T_3> the <T_0> at the head@@ quar@@ ters , and i told <T_7> -- <T_1> lied -- <T_4> told them , &quot; <T_5> , we are going to <T_8> a couple of <T_2> per day , just a few <T_9> . &quot;
now , if <T_2> think about <T_3> our world got <T_1> ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated , <T_0> usual suspe@@ cts re@@ ar their heads .
cam@@ ille <T_1> : <T_0> from a <T_2>
she was eventually audi@@ tioned for <T_8> royal bal@@ let school ; she became a sol@@ o@@ ist ; she had <T_9> wonderful career at the royal bal@@ let . she eventually gradu@@ ated from the <T_0> bal@@ let school <T_7> fo@@ unded her own company -- <T_2> gil@@ lian lyn@@ ne dance company -- <T_6> andrew l@@ loy@@ d we@@ ber . she &apos;s been responsible for some of the most successful musi@@ cal theater produ@@ ctions in history ; she &apos;s given pleas@@ ure to <T_3> ; <T_4> she &apos;s a multi@@ -@@ million@@ ai@@ re . somebody <T_1> might have put <T_5> on medi@@ cation and told her to cal@@ m down .
let me <T_6> you , <T_8> a strange way to s@@ have <T_9> because <T_7> thought about it <T_0> i realized that <T_3> way <T_1> was sha@@ ving then would be the way i would <T_4> for the rest of <T_5> life -- because i had to keep the wid@@ th the <T_2> .

<T_0> anyway .
and we found in about 30 days <T_0> could go and take a <T_9> fol@@ ks from <T_5> valley , fly them to uganda , <T_4> a car , set up the first <T_1> connection at the national library of <T_3> , <T_2> out what <T_6> wanted , and get a <T_7> going making books <T_8> ru@@ ral uganda .
many <T_9> you <T_5> know that <T_7> po@@ ta@@ to chip chair by <T_2> and ray <T_6> comes exactly <T_1> that kind <T_3> instance : fi@@ ber@@ glass <T_0> available for <T_4> use all of a <T_8> .
this is <T_0> the weight <T_1> the age .
<T_6> you might think , <T_2> if <T_8> could <T_0> on corpo@@ ra@@ tions to tell <T_7> what they were doing <T_3> the back of their stor@@ es , <T_9> wouldn &apos;t need to go s@@ ne@@ aking <T_5> the back , opening up b@@ ins <T_1> having a look at <T_4> &apos;s inside .

if <T_0> could , would <T_1> ?
and since <T_7> are many <T_1> vari@@ ants , and they have <T_0> such gra@@ dients , this means that <T_9> we deter@@ mine <T_4> dna sequence -- a <T_5> from one <T_8> -- we can quite ac@@ cur@@ ately <T_6> where that person <T_3> from , provi@@ ded that its parents or <T_2> haven &apos;t moved around too much .
<T_2> know <T_1> most of <T_4> wealth was made <T_3> the <T_0> 18@@ 00 .
so <T_0> technology , 3d printing , <T_8> new design <T_6> really help <T_2> to reduce the <T_5> , which <T_7> the biggest issue <T_1> air@@ craft design , because <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> lin@@ ked to greenhouse gas <T_9> .

in other words , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> helping <T_0> .

<T_3> , <T_0> &apos;ve invented <T_1> . <T_5> all <T_6> animals that we have dom@@ est@@ icated , the most important animal <T_7> we &apos;ve dom@@ est@@ icated <T_8> been <T_2> . <T_4> ?
and so <T_1> wa@@ ited , <T_2> sat at <T_0> tab@@ les , we wa@@ ited <T_3> wa@@ ited .
in <T_5> world <T_1> the middle east <T_4> the moment , the deb@@ ates are , <T_3> you <T_2> , <T_0> .
and <T_2> wanted it to <T_1> easy to <T_0> .
now , <T_2> is <T_1> little <T_0> .
<T_8> can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and <T_3> it <T_7> here -- don &apos;t <T_1> -- <T_2> will try to ro@@ tate the <T_0> , and <T_4> , if <T_6> did it <T_5> , it sta@@ ys <T_9> .
now <T_1> or <T_3> , these <T_0> are at the <T_2> of their <T_4> .

and so whether they &apos;re <T_9> us to become creative and <T_7> , or whether they &apos;re <T_8> us to <T_2> more deeply connected despite distance , or whether they are <T_3> tru@@ sted <T_6> who &apos;s <T_0> us at@@ tain our personal goals in becoming our highest and <T_4> selves , <T_5> me , robots are <T_1> about people .
what &apos;s <T_1> is <T_0> we do <T_2> .
it <T_0> a second meaning , which <T_1> to send <T_2> as <T_3> . ok ?
because <T_0> introdu@@ ced a <T_4> between <T_1> word itself <T_2> its <T_3> .
they <T_1> expect to have a <T_3> of forms <T_4> fun@@ ctions within the <T_2> of <T_0> .
<T_1> just go <T_0> and start a fund@@ rais@@ er .
<T_2> , all too common in under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed clinics , kill@@ s 1.@@ 3 million each <T_1> . mar@@ c ko@@ sk@@ a clu@@ es us in <T_4> <T_0> deva@@ stat@@ ing global problem with facts <T_7> photos and hid@@ den-@@ camera foot@@ age . <T_3> shares his solution : <T_8> lo@@ w-@@ cost <T_5> that can &apos;t <T_9> used twice <T_6>
we <T_3> that <T_2> doing active <T_0> in the <T_1> .
<T_0> people say <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> .
in the &apos; <T_4> , my <T_0> and passion <T_2> transi@@ tional art forms <T_5> me <T_6> a <T_3> form , <T_8> came from <T_7> squ@@ at@@ ter camp outside <T_1> .
why <T_0> you <T_1> passionate ? &quot;
<T_5> that they started doing themselves -- like changing <T_8> floor going <T_3> the <T_9> &apos;s room so that <T_0> signi@@ fied , &quot; this <T_2> my room . this is my <T_4> space &quot; -- <T_1> a really <T_7> sort of design solution to <T_6> problem .
<T_0> don &apos;t have to <T_2> the <T_1> .
<T_4> is <T_2> affe@@ ctive compon@@ ent , which <T_3> , &quot; i <T_1> for <T_0> . &quot;
so , here , whatever <T_1> i do <T_5> my physical <T_3> is actually rep@@ licated <T_6> the <T_7> world <T_0> using this <T_8> device that i made , around eight <T_2> back , in <T_4> .
<T_6> . so , the <T_4> was treated then <T_7> a thir@@ d-@@ generation <T_3> antibio@@ tic and <T_0> , and <T_2> day three , it didn &apos;t help : she had <T_5> to <T_1> failure .
they <T_8> to think of an <T_3> from this <T_4> &apos;s di@@ le@@ m@@ ma , and we <T_2> concep@@ ts of collective action , basically trying to bring various <T_9> together around <T_0> table , expla@@ ining to all of them how much <T_1> would be in their interests <T_5> they si@@ mul@@ taneously would stop bri@@ bing , and to make a long story short , we managed to <T_6> get ger@@ many to sign together with the other o@@ ec@@ d countries and a few <T_7> expor@@ ters .
<T_0> very <T_2> i &apos;ve been an <T_1> .
they can actually <T_1> move towards the light . you <T_2> to just choose <T_0> species .
there &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive .
and we have <T_1> who <T_0> in <T_3> poverty <T_2> asi@@ ans .
<T_0> then <T_3> get an f@@ mr@@ i speci@@ alist , and you get <T_4> wil@@ son , <T_5> you get other kinds of <T_2> scientists , <T_1> neuro@@ en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologists .
so of course <T_0> you <T_3> &apos;t really <T_2> yourself <T_1> &apos;t really get done proper@@ ly .
i <T_3> i <T_6> to do anything <T_2> could <T_7> ear@@ n <T_0> money <T_4> support <T_5> people i <T_1> about . &quot;
<T_2> : <T_0> don &apos;t think it &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_2> has <T_0> happened in my <T_1> .
<T_3> seem@@ ed <T_9> for our <T_4> and friends , <T_8> was either <T_2> ex@@ o@@ tic <T_7> , this <T_1> land that <T_5> exists only <T_6> their imagination , or the <T_0> of hor@@ ror , fam@@ ine .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> and a wi@@ do@@ w .
and <T_2> it <T_4> f@@ las@@ hing , <T_3> &apos;s just going to be <T_0> of the le@@ ds that &apos;s f@@ las@@ hing <T_1> fast .
well , <T_1> one , <T_0> skills .
so <T_3> pick it up , we put <T_6> on <T_2> table where there &apos;s two <T_5> re@@ wards , but <T_1> this case <T_4> the one on the right <T_0> food .
i read about a <T_7> recently of <T_0> entrepreneurs , and the auth@@ or found that these people shared a hab@@ it that he called &quot; <T_4> par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , &quot; which meant that <T_8> people , instead of <T_1> their fe@@ ars , these people read them <T_5> , <T_6> studied them , <T_9> then they transl@@ ated that <T_3> into prepar@@ ation <T_2> action .
and i <T_1> the <T_4> that <T_3> are really <T_0> kinds of <T_2> .
so this <T_0> right here is <T_1> me out .
<T_3> . <T_1> don &apos;t talk about <T_0> . <T_4> don &apos;t talk about the <T_2> .
the <T_1> is 25 <T_0> a month . <T_2> ?
<T_2> &apos;m <T_0> ready <T_1> jo@@ in@@ t replac@@ ement . &quot;
<T_0> they doesn &apos;t seem <T_3> go <T_1> way , these <T_2> .
<T_1> geck@@ os do it <T_0> .
so <T_0> the subway <T_3> new <T_1> , i saw <T_5> cor@@ respon@@ dence between ri@@ ding <T_2> subway and <T_4> .
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> area again .
<T_3> great depression <T_2> not a <T_0> in this <T_1> pro@@ gr@@ ession .
and <T_8> the <T_1> few <T_4> , <T_7> of you have been <T_0> me , &quot; how did <T_6> come <T_5> ? <T_2> did <T_3> get started doing this ? &quot;
so , let &apos;s <T_0> off in <T_1> .
<T_0> is at play right <T_1> .
we might <T_4> two <T_3> three <T_2> sharks was@@ hed up in <T_0> a <T_1> , if we &apos;re kind of <T_5> .
it <T_1> a di@@ m@@ ly <T_0> sha@@ ck .
<T_7> , what i can do now with <T_6> colleagues in <T_5> is we <T_1> create computer <T_3> that <T_4> analy@@ ze <T_0> l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic tra@@ ces <T_2> de@@ ception .
<T_3> fra@@ mers <T_6> us what they called a re@@ public , but by a re@@ public they meant <T_5> represent@@ ative democracy , <T_4> by a represent@@ ative democracy , they meant a <T_9> , <T_7> ma@@ dison put it in fe@@ der@@ alist <T_8> , <T_2> would have a <T_0> that would be depen@@ dent upon the <T_1> alone .
of course , it <T_1> shr@@ in@@ ks the pump@@ ing equi@@ p@@ ment and <T_0> capital costs .
<T_1> was <T_4> to talk <T_5> my new bo@@ ss , but <T_3> to <T_0> up my <T_2> .
<T_1> at the same time , <T_2> &apos;re fighting another <T_0> .
and <T_2> can <T_1> learn from <T_0> of that ?
towards the <T_0> of their life , <T_2> become nearly <T_1> .
<T_0> it &apos;s ok <T_3> even <T_5> you &apos;re <T_2> h@@ yp@@ noti@@ zed , you will forget <T_1> that <T_4> .
so <T_3> make it to age <T_6> , you <T_4> only have to have had a <T_1> good <T_2> , you also <T_0> to have won <T_5> genetic <T_7> .
<T_1> then , <T_5> the <T_0> ax@@ is <T_4> in , <T_2> actually blu@@ r into <T_3> volu@@ me .
thank you very much .
<T_1> , there &apos;s <T_0> scientific revolution <T_2> else .
<T_0> does <T_1> mean , &quot; d@@ ough <T_2> lea@@ ven &quot; ?
<T_4> that <T_0> on screen <T_1> to be very easily <T_3> by a typical <T_2> .
<T_9> you <T_1> in fact do <T_8> emplo@@ y <T_7> of the world &apos;s top <T_3> and female super@@ models , <T_0> them to walk <T_5> leng@@ th <T_6> the train , hand@@ ing out free ch@@ at@@ e@@ au <T_2> for the entire <T_4> of the journey .
<T_0> did <T_1> with 15 <T_2> 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies .
<T_0> sig@@ ned <T_2> a <T_1> lab@@ el .
<T_0> are working <T_1> close to <T_4> other that <T_3> hori@@ zon@@ tal <T_2> of dna .

so <T_2> &apos;ve created , using <T_1> super@@ computer , the world &apos;s <T_3> computer model <T_4> malaria , <T_5> we &apos;ll show <T_0> now .
i <T_2> out of <T_0> car , <T_1> several times .
it &apos;s called subtext .
here &apos;s <T_0> good news . <T_3> cities <T_2> in <T_1> u.s .
but <T_5> esti@@ mate <T_1> about <T_3> in three <T_6> of food <T_4> eat is <T_2> or indi@@ re@@ ctly pol@@ lin@@ ated <T_0> hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es .
&quot; good <T_1> , <T_3> . <T_2> now on , you guys hit <T_4> pi@@ le <T_0> . &quot;
of <T_2> , the <T_0> is really <T_1> .
<T_1> first <T_2> , in the back , <T_3> &apos;s <T_0> i .
<T_1> to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste <T_0> out of <T_2> tube .
<T_1> au@@ dien@@ ces <T_2> &apos;t come to <T_4> the <T_3> die , <T_5> come to see <T_0> live .
<T_5> &apos;ve created <T_7> , <T_3> syste@@ matically privilege , encourage , <T_1> nar@@ row <T_6> of the <T_0> sou@@ l <T_2> left the others <T_4> .
i &apos;ve got a <T_1> experiment i want to try <T_0> you .
that &apos;s how it works .
we don &apos;t <T_3> to do anything . <T_1> we have to <T_2> is <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;m <T_4> suggest@@ ing <T_3> we need to be allo@@ wing g@@ uns and <T_0> into <T_2> .
<T_1> , <T_2> would not <T_4> satis@@ fied <T_0> you had actually done <T_3> work .
<T_2> let &apos;s <T_1> : <T_4> not <T_0> incre@@ mental sort of <T_3> .
so <T_3> is this ? i <T_2> you <T_0> ask . <T_4> , <T_1> don &apos;t .
in this very short period of time , you know , whether <T_3> call it <T_4> last 15 years <T_9> so of being online , <T_0> the last , you know , four or five <T_8> of being online all the time , <T_1> relationship to our surro@@ und@@ ings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided . you know , <T_7> &apos;re both looking inside the scre@@ ens <T_6> we &apos;re looking out in <T_2> world <T_5> us .
<T_8> &apos;t <T_0> back <T_6> from <T_9> on all the details , <T_4> do you <T_5> , do <T_3> want to help <T_1> in this , provide <T_2> money that they <T_7> ? &quot;
what <T_0> it made of ?
<T_2> the po@@ st-@@ kat@@ r@@ ina <T_1> , we have <T_0> more in <T_3> .
somebody &apos;s story@@ telling . <T_1> art . you <T_2> talk to <T_0> .
<T_3> : the <T_0> i saw <T_5> <T_2> wife &apos;s hand , &quot; why <T_6> you using <T_1> na@@ sty cl@@ oth <T_4> &quot;

<T_0> wish <T_1> all the best of lu@@ ck in main@@ ta@@ ining that <T_3> in <T_2> future <T_4> .

<T_0> there &apos;s <T_4> a <T_3> of <T_2> that you don &apos;t <T_1> .
