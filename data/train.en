so that kid would do fine in the cr@@ ash .
but you open one of the garage do@@ ors and there is a profession@@ al-@@ size bo@@ x@@ ing ring inside .
the numbers increased by re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es po@@ uring in from bur@@ und@@ i and over the la@@ ke from con@@ go .
and the other thing is to allow those hun@@ ches to connect with other people &apos;s hun@@ ches ; that &apos;s what often happens .
it &apos;s also that we pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly mis@@ understand go@@ li@@ ath .
it &apos;s nothing we had to do about this .
you can ask , &quot; what do you expect for the old stars , stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time , they &apos;ve had pl@@ enty of time to interact with the black hole . &quot;
the second thing that really attra@@ cted me were his bright red che@@ e@@ ks .
it &apos;s by g@@ al stri@@ pping that tissue we humani@@ ze it , and then we can put it back into a patient &apos;s kne@@ e .
a fi@@ f@@ th of kids under two drin@@ ks so@@ da .
we &apos;ve just seen our first po@@ lar be@@ ars .
and you turn around , and there &apos;s a hi@@ ll@@ side behind you with a neighborhood going in , and bu@@ ll@@ do@@ z@@ ers are pushing pil@@ es of soil back and forth .
and imagine the mas@@ h@@ -up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an inspi@@ ring goal -- there were 21 gi@@ f@@ ts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it &apos;s mat@@ ched by millions of small gi@@ f@@ ts from around the globe , there@@ by engaging lots of people , and building vi@@ sibility and engaging people in the goal that &apos;s st@@ ated .
and what i do is i look for simi@@ l@@ ari@@ ties and differences in the solutions that they &apos;ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
even the most p@@ es@@ simi@@ stic impact scen@@ ari@@ os of the u.@@ n .
well , that would have been much different , i think i would have inst@@ antly answered , &quot; yes , yes , i feel it all the time . i feel god &apos;s love when i &apos;m hur@@ t and con@@ f@@ used , and i feel con@@ sol@@ ed and car@@ ed for . i take shel@@ ter in god &apos;s love when i don &apos;t understand why tra@@ ge@@ dy hi@@ ts , and i feel god &apos;s love when i look with gra@@ titude at all the beauty i see . &quot;
now most people would answer grill@@ ed , and it &apos;s true that grill@@ ed chi@@ cken does con@@ tain less fat and fewer cal@@ ories .
b@@ j : but it had to ri@@ de . it had to have a ri@@ der .
that &apos;s really , really powerful , and it &apos;s going to be more important than the social la@@ yer .
now , the to@@ a@@ ster was huge because they used to make to@@ ast on open fir@@ es , and it took a lot of time and attention .
it did not evolve for natural survival .
and notice what &apos;s going on here .
down at the very base of it , there &apos;s fi@@ ber opti@@ cs that work better than ours , actually , to move light , but you can tie them in a k@@ not ; they &apos;re incredibly flexible .
and indeed , people know the cau@@ sal links quite well in some of these out@@ comes .
my hair used to be straight .
that &apos;s the part where i sold the vol@@ vo and bought the toyota .
all right . they look like org charts .
the people &apos;s super@@ market .
somebody somewhere , a group of people , starts cla@@ pping in rhyth@@ m with my steps .
this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .
and when we do have the oc@@ ca@@ sional european success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the united states .
everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
but the sound is too qui@@ et for any of us to ever hear .
what we are trying to say is that once you ou@@ ts@@ our@@ ce the bottom end of the la@@ d@@ der , you -- it &apos;s a self-@@ per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating act , because of the sin@@ king sk@@ ill la@@ d@@ der , and the sin@@ king sk@@ ill la@@ d@@ der is simply the point that you can &apos;t be an investment ban@@ ker without having been an analy@@ st once .
pin@@ oc@@ chi@@ o is probably one of my best design products , my favorite one .
and that might be our chance of actually discover@@ ing life when we cannot vi@@ sibly see it .
when somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anon@@ ym@@ ous i@@ p number , made an edi@@ t to my page -- that sounds su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous -- who is this person ? somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see high@@ ligh@@ ted in red all of the changes that took place , to see , ok , well , these words have changed , things like this .
but most of all , for the first time in decades , they expect to be active partici@@ pants , not spect@@ ators , in the aff@@ air@@ s of their country .
well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the monkeys a financial cur@@ ren@@ cy , and they do very similar things with it .
they have a computer company that makes computers in south africa .
so there are schools in slums like this .
at this point , the game is over .
so here &apos;s the second i@@ ter@@ ation , and the third , four@@ th and so on .
and here was the most intri@@ gu@@ ing result : the task allo@@ cation .
the first thing that you have on the tax is -- you have a tax for a stronger america -- 33 c@@ ents .
well , that &apos;s too simple , let &apos;s add another piece .
a very simple definition .
and mom and dad ? never been up .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re actually going to set up these me@@ et@@ ings ourselves .
it is developed in the cultur@@ es .
what that tells us is that dop@@ am@@ ine is not ba@@ thing the brain of these flies like sou@@ p .
what are your own plans ? are you sta@@ ying at mit , or are you going to do something with this ?
and it &apos;s basically just saying that entro@@ py is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ range the con@@ stitu@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that ma@@ cro@@ sc@@ opi@@ cally it looks the same .
in 2002 , we started a new institute , the institute for biological energy alterna@@ tives , where we set out two go@@ als : one , to understand the impact of our technology on the environment , and how to understand the environment better , and two , to start down this process of making synthe@@ tic life to understand basic life .
there &apos;s nobody to stick up for the future self .
and there are a bunch of people who , on a sun@@ ny day , would rather be inside and mon@@ it@@ oring this , the admini@@ str@@ ator &apos;s notice board , itself a wi@@ ki page that anyone can edi@@ t .
the city actually appro@@ ached us .
many stories matter .
this is eric el@@ dre@@ d making books at wal@@ den pon@@ d -- th@@ ore@@ au &apos;s works .
the rest are sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to graduate this jun@@ e .
oh , thank you .
i ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere .
this video , i think , gets across the concept that i &apos;m talking about quite dramatically .
and i thought , i &apos;ll test them , they &apos;ll get a zero -- i &apos;ll give the materials , i &apos;ll come back and test them -- they get another zero , i &apos;ll go back and say , &quot; yes , we need teachers for certain things . &quot;
they sell mi@@ ster sp@@ las@@ h@@ y pants shir@@ ts and p@@ ins .
and i &apos;m going to show you a small sample of this , but there &apos;s really a theore@@ tical reason why technology develop@@ s in an ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al fashion .
500 years ago , it ran into a competi@@ tor with a le@@ thal advan@@ tage .
but then we have other people who don &apos;t choose to have faci@@ al surgery .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge ma@@ cro@@ co@@ sm of colle@@ ctive consciousness .
we &apos;re even seeing it in co@@ zy social democra@@ cies like swe@@ den , fin@@ land and ger@@ many .
we can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
m@@ g : i think to an ex@@ tent , you have to understand that it &apos;s a@@ xi@@ om@@ atic among ha@@ ck@@ ers that they do that .
and i re@@ ached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascin@@ ated and im@@ pres@@ sed by its speed and its strength and agi@@ lity .
instead of finding out what we thought was the case -- that blin@@ d@@ ness was caused mostly by glau@@ com@@ a and tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a -- we were a@@ sto@@ unded to find out that blin@@ d@@ ness was caused instead by cat@@ ar@@ act .
the biggest lesson i learned was many years later when i went to be@@ ver@@ ly hi@@ ll@@ s and i ran into a talent agen@@ t who looked at me up and down and said i don &apos;t look like i have any experience to be working in this business .
when you get in the sky@@ car -- and i can tell you , there &apos;s only one other person that &apos;s flo@@ wn it , but he had the same sen@@ sation -- you really feel like you &apos;re being li@@ fted up by a magic car@@ pe@@ t , without any vibra@@ tion what@@ so@@ ever . the sen@@ sation is unbelie@@ vable .
because dop@@ am@@ ine , which f@@ loo@@ ds into your system when you &apos;re positive , has two functions .
and aren &apos;t we gr@@ ate@@ ful that we have hearts that can feel these vibra@@ tions in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature ?
and then they become ta@@ d@@ po@@ les and fro@@ gs . &quot;
my mother had to do a lot of expla@@ ining , telling people that her son did not com@@ mit a pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated ar@@ son .
this is africa . 10 percent the world population , most in poverty .
there &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
and , actually , you get more appreci@@ ation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it .
this was my little bit of bio@@ -@@ mi@@ mi@@ c@@ ry .
so seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be g@@ ali@@ le@@ o and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time , and suddenly you say , &quot; wow , it &apos;s way more complicated than we thought it was . &quot;
and he made a few comm@@ ents .
from time to time , one he@@ ars chri@@ sti@@ ans telling the story of how god organized things for them , so that everything worked out all right -- some difficul@@ ty over@@ come , some ill@@ ness cu@@ red , some trouble a@@ ver@@ ted , a parking space found at a cru@@ cial time .
they said , &quot; go and do it , and we &apos;ll come and le@@ cture . &quot;
&apos;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee@@ b@@ ates , that is re@@ b@@ ates for effi@@ cient new autos paid for by fe@@ es on in@@ effi@@ cient ones .
this was a sensi@@ tive box .
we &apos;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
and i remember that lesson to this day .
since i was a student , i wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in gand@@ o .
this is light over density , pul@@ ls the material around in .
i believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ surance of im@@ mortality that makes self-@@ sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce at these moments so rela@@ tively easy .
how was that passed on ? how did he get to hear mo@@ z@@ art ?
it &apos;s like having your car stol@@ en . it &apos;s an inf@@ eri@@ or op@@ tion .
robert kennedy once said that &quot; few of us have the great@@ ness to ben@@ d history itself , but each of us can work to change a small por@@ tion of events . &quot;
as a researcher , every once in a while you en@@ coun@@ ter something a little dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting .
rights management is no longer simply a question of ow@@ ner@@ ship , it &apos;s a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .
they &apos;re talking about love and compassion and wisdom and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , but they are acting sel@@ fish and pa@@ the@@ tic .
we &apos;ve done these things in research now in every single company that i &apos;ve worked with , getting them to write down three new things that they &apos;re gr@@ ate@@ ful for for 21 days in a row , three new things each day .
so i knew there were two cars with two li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates on each .
in the united states , less than seven percent of our plasti@@ cs are recycl@@ ed .
maybe a ti@@ mber rat@@ t@@ les@@ na@@ ke lived there .
and these are facts , guys .
but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .
that &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
as lea@@ h , one of the fo@@ under@@ s of the group , says , &quot; i like traditional music very much .
when the poet and my@@ stic , ru@@ mi , met his spiritual compani@@ on , sha@@ ms of tab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to to@@ ss ru@@ mi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dis@@ solve .
i feel so stron@@ gly that you cannot ask a small far@@ mer to work the land and ben@@ d over to grow a he@@ ct@@ are of ri@@ ce , 1@@ 50,000 times , just to plant a cro@@ p and we@@ ed it .
but , japan , in contra@@ st to india and china , main@@ ta@@ ined its national so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty .
i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed .
these images that show at one time , there was very fast flo@@ wing water on the surface of mars .
in this tradition , the bri@@ de-@@ to-@@ be disp@@ la@@ ys all of their belon@@ g@@ ings , which they soon bring to their new husband .
well , it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been la@@ id down .
mat@@ t is the first ever hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird pilot .
now most environ@@ ment@@ ali@@ sts don &apos;t say growth is good , because , in our lexi@@ con , as@@ p@@ halt is two words : as@@ sig@@ ning bl@@ ame .
i get a lot of really nice letters , lots of them .
i basically shot everything with short len@@ ses , which means that you &apos;re very close to the action , but fra@@ med it very simi@@ lar@@ ly to the long lens sh@@ ots which gives you a sense of distance , so i was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven &apos;t really quite seen before .
it &apos;s just one of billi@@ ons of galaxies in the universe .
it gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we could all agree , and create some instal@@ lations .
nasa had no interest ; they tried to kill the project .
i had fro@@ st@@ bi@@ te in my left big to@@ e .

it &apos;s an honor to be here . thanks very much .
we have exactly one emplo@@ ye@@ e , and that emplo@@ ye@@ e is our lead software develop@@ er .

it re@@ a@@ ches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , pri@@ mar@@ ily .
acci@@ dents are expensive and co@@ stly .
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
i would like to share with you this .
he had a body very similar to our own , and he was on the th@@ res@@ hold of becoming human .
it &apos;s volun@@ tary .
and we called all of the social inve@@ stors we know .
it &apos;s almost more important than their e@@ ye@@ sight .
perhaps like this .
and then the next thing that i needed was a ma@@ ke@@ over .
but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point .
we all have come from a long way , here in africa , and conver@@ ged in this region of africa , which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place .
for 30 years , i &apos;ve been cover@@ ing school re@@ form and we &apos;ve basically re@@ organized the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic boxes -- char@@ ters , private schools , v@@ ou@@ chers -- but we &apos;ve had disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting results year after year .
knowing your country to be economi@@ cal condu@@ ci@@ ve for investment , and your people as transpar@@ ent and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy to engage in business , on which premi@@ se i write you .
and , finally , ja@@ y dra@@ g@@ ged me to my home@@ town , tor@@ onto , canada .
thank you .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
this is the kind of com@@ mit@@ ment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
if it is there it can be done right now .
now of course , the en@@ ab@@ ling technologies are based on the internet , and in the man@@ y-@@ to-@@ many era , every des@@ k@@ top is now a prin@@ ting press , a broad@@ casting station , a community or a market@@ place .
and we looked at , from the 19@@ 50s on , there were nu@@ mer@@ ous examples of other archite@@ cts trying to do the same thing .
as it does , i su@@ spe@@ ct , that of everybody here .
so we know flo@@ wers , we know fru@@ its and vege@@ tables , even some al@@ fal@@ f@@ a in ha@@ y that the li@@ ve@@ stock for the me@@ ats that we eat , r@@ ely on pollin@@ ators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollin@@ ators are attra@@ cted to plants for their ne@@ c@@ tar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flo@@ wers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sper@@ m counter@@ part , along the way , and then travel to different flo@@ wers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
well , i think , probably , the ol@@ dest version of this is probably the sexu@@ al di@@ vision of labor .
now my publi@@ shing career began when i designed the cover for my ei@@ gh@@ th grade ye@@ ar@@ book , and if you &apos;re wondering about the st@@ yle of dres@@ s i put our mas@@ co@@ t in , i was really into bell bi@@ v de@@ vo@@ e and m@@ c hammer and van@@ ill@@ a ice at the time .
so , 100 billion galaxies , 13@@ .@@ 7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to mon@@ ter@@ ey , actually , is about the same as from mon@@ ter@@ ey to these things .
if you &apos;ve got malaria , we give you qu@@ in@@ ine or some der@@ i@@ va@@ tive of it .
and he thinks i &apos;m saying , &quot; take my picture . &quot;
it has an air channel . it has a blood channel .
they &apos;ve built bri@@ d@@ ges , and they &apos;ve walked across them .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
no to burning books . the institute of eg@@ y@@ pt was bur@@ ned on dec@@ ember 17@@ th , a huge cultural loss .
which i think is just fascinating .
you can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone invol@@ ving all of the senses .
in my mind , there is something to learn from the history of europe .
i think it &apos;s appropriate to call it the greatest mis@@ allo@@ cation of resources in the history of the world .
there &apos;s three se@@ ctions .
you needed my empathy and compassion , and above all else , you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn &apos;t let the system down .
because they let you keep contin@@ ence , bla@@ d@@ der control , and sexu@@ al function after surgery , all of which is generally fair@@ ly important to the patient .
bring it back up .
give jo@@ e a ro@@ und of app@@ l@@ ause .
and when you are fac@@ ed with the pro@@ spe@@ ct of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything .
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
i think it &apos;s time that the educa@@ tioni@@ sts made their own spe@@ cs , and i have such a set of spe@@ cs . this is a brief look at that .
&quot; bad be@@ ar , bad be@@ ar ! &quot; vo@@ om !
it &apos;s a very big signal ; it &apos;s sent to the brain says , &quot; go and eat . &quot;
let me end with just one more example .
nothing unusual about that at all , except that these are actually not the butt@@ ons that take you to an individual floor .
third , if you notice a persi@@ stent change in your breast , insi@@ st on addi@@ tional ima@@ ging .
in order to profit from its oil it has to ex@@ port it through turkey or sy@@ ri@@ a , and other countries , and iraq itself .
we call up the doctor of dust , and there is such a person .
here you can see the pla@@ te holding it , and you can see the im@@ plants being put in -- so that in one operation we achieve this and this .
on the other hand , there are a lot of things that drive me down , take the emotional level down , and you &apos;ve got to re@@ cover from those .
this is the cover of &quot; philosophi@@ cal transa@@ ctions , &quot; the first scientific journ@@ al ever published in english in the middle of the 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s , and it was created by a group of people who had been call@@ ing themselves &quot; the invi@@ sible college , &quot; a group of natural philosop@@ her@@ s who only later would call themselves scientists , and they wanted to improve the way natural philosop@@ her@@ s argu@@ ed with each other , and they needed to do two things for this .
so , we have a little car@@ pe@@ t that you can look at your amount of po@@ stu@@ ral s@@ way , and look at the changes in your po@@ stu@@ ral s@@ way over many months .
and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade .
so now i have to improvi@@ se again .
we &apos;re dra@@ wn to virtual ro@@ mance , to computer games that seem like worl@@ ds , to the idea that robots , robots , will someday be our true compani@@ ons .
and every spring and au@@ tum@@ n , exactly at the equ@@ in@@ o@@ x , the sun ri@@ ses behind his temple , and perfe@@ ctly ba@@ th@@ es her temple with his sha@@ do@@ w .
there &apos;s very good evidence -- again , we don &apos;t necessarily have a peer-@@ re@@ viewed metho@@ d@@ ology that &apos;s bul@@ let@@ pro@@ of yet -- but there &apos;s very good evidence that the average cat in europe has a larger environmental footprint in its life@@ time than the average african .
all together , they achi@@ ev@@ ed these results : increased the number of people on anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als , life@@ -@@ saving anti-@@ aids drugs ; nearly hal@@ ved dea@@ ths from malaria ; vac@@ cin@@ ated so many that 5@@ .@@ 4 million lives will be saved .
when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 20@@ 50 , i always think of these graph@@ s .
in fact , on all these disc@@ s there were docum@@ ents .
one of them is just lab@@ el@@ ed &quot; mi@@ sc@@ ell@@ an@@ e@@ ous technical senses . &quot;
now you may think this is just a thri@@ ll@@ -@@ see@@ king tri@@ p , a pleasure ri@@ de , just the world &apos;s biggest st@@ unt .
scientists , p@@ ure mathemati@@ cians among them , follow one or the other of two path@@ ways : first through early discover@@ ies , a problem is identi@@ fied and a solution is s@@ ought .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for chri@@ stin@@ a si@@ de@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a mi@@ gra@@ ine .
but look at how predict@@ able this is .
ber@@ n@@ ard pin@@ a@@ y@@ on ag@@ ba@@ o@@ s@@ i : we have been so deep into the foreign movi@@ es .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can per@@ cei@@ ve and what we can measure is only going to wi@@ den .
franc@@ o sa@@ c@@ chi : a tour of nollywood , nigeria &apos;s boom@@ ing film industry
that &apos;s very good . i love that .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just ritu@@ als that give us meaning . &quot;
but we can also pull up , using spe@@ ech@@ -@@ to-@@ text trans@@ lation , we can pull the entire tran@@ script , and that works even for people with kind of funny acc@@ ents like myself .
so , wonderful things and gri@@ m things .
they stop . they mate with his domesti@@ cated ge@@ ese , and his flo@@ ck continu@@ es .
and for those of you whose lives have been tou@@ ched by mental ill@@ ness , you know how challenging it can be .
well in the end , what we can also do : we use a lot of old new@@ spa@@ pers to make ca@@ ps .
sta@@ ying in the ocean and evol@@ ving in the ocean for 2 billion years , finally came out onto the land . and then of course it had great -- much greater freedom , and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean .
self-@@ susta@@ ining enti@@ ties , 18 months return on investment , plus we &apos;re pa@@ ying people living wa@@ ge and health benefits , while feeding people for pen@@ ni@@ es on the dollar .
why ?
we had a two-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ da@@ y-@@ old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn &apos;t taken it from somebody else .
she has one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world .
there &apos;s a thing that happens when you m@@ old and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into sili@@ c@@ one and cast it in resi@@ n , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
thank you@@ .b@@ l : thank you very much .
there are common elements of this that you &apos;ll see throughout chi@@ ca@@ go , and then there are your big@@ -@@ d design stat@@ ements : the pri@@ tz@@ ker pa@@ vili@@ on done by frank ge@@ hr@@ y .
chapter 12 high@@ lights people being born into a bat@@ tle that is not of their making , but becomes their own .
so if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so i picked up some sh@@ ells on the be@@ ach . and i asked them , what is scaling ? what &apos;s inside your pi@@ pes ?
and they all tell you , &quot; yes , we have won the lot@@ ter@@ y . &quot;
so we said , what is on the surface of these u@@ gly tu@@ mor@@ s ?
and it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
the culture of tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce was thin .
and einstein said -- and i think this is a quote , again , that has not been passed down in his leg@@ acy -- that &quot; these kinds of people are geni@@ uses in the art of living , more necessary to the di@@ gni@@ ty , security and joy of humanity than the discover@@ ers of obje@@ ctive knowledge . &quot;
and what is it that really makes us us ?
it &apos;s the bridge over the drin@@ a river , the subject of a no@@ vel by i@@ vo and@@ ri@@ ć , and it talks about how , in that very trou@@ bled part of europe and the bal@@ kan@@ s , over time there &apos;s been enormous building of walls .
jo@@ sh sil@@ ver deli@@ vers his brilli@@ antly simple solution for corre@@ cting vision at the lo@@ west cost possible -- ad@@ ju@@ stable , li@@ qui@@ d-@@ filled len@@ ses . at ted@@ global 200@@ 9 , he demo@@ s his aff@@ ord@@ able e@@ ye@@ glasses and reve@@ als his global plan to distribu@@ te them to a billion people in need by 2020 .
the k@@ u klu@@ x kl@@ an is an n@@ go .
whether you love subur@@ bia &apos;s le@@ af@@ y priv@@ acy or you hate its sou@@ ll@@ ess commercial stri@@ ps , there are reasons why it &apos;s important to retro@@ fit .
because since pre-@@ parti@@ tion , they &apos;ve been building dem@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the ground .
and you can actually make plastic from obviously o@@ ils which come from plants , but also from star@@ ches .
or should they not ?
and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in down@@ town , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .
now my point is the small things matter .
but if you look at cultur@@ es which have cy@@ cli@@ cal and based on infinite lives , you will see a comfort with fu@@ zz@@ y logi@@ c , with opinion , with con@@ tex@@ tu@@ al thinking , with everything is relative , sort of -- mostly .
because car@@ gi@@ ll has 20 to 25 percent of global pal@@ m oil .
and in the movie , they &apos;ve got a great scene in there where the word &quot; sho@@ e &quot; is said , and a whole bunch of &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s shoes pop into my imagination .
i hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
no re@@ ference che@@ cks . none of the usual back@@ ground stuff , no .
it was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency .
mon@@ ter@@ ey is one of those .
but first we have to know .
somehow in tick@@ ling our ear@@ dr@@ um that trans@@ mi@@ ts energy down our hearing bones , which get conver@@ ted to a fluid impul@@ se inside the co@@ ch@@ le@@ a and then somehow conver@@ ted into an electri@@ cal signal in our audi@@ tory ner@@ ves that somehow wind up in our brains as a per@@ ception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
i &apos;m then thro@@ wn in an ice pon@@ d , i &apos;m cool@@ ed 15 degrees lower and i could be taken to a critical care hospital .
now , you know the idea of a burning platform , that you &apos;re somewhere where the costs of sta@@ ying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different , perhaps something radi@@ cally different .
the cu@@ bs , which are taken , are separ@@ ated .
and not enough is being done about this .
there is only one opinion that matters , the kids that are either going to use it or not . &quot;
so , i wanted to be a pain@@ ter like him , except , i don &apos;t know how to pain@@ t .
i mean , i was a known visi@@ tor of that em@@ bas@@ sy .
and in terms of the temporary nature of it , our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be .
i &apos;ve learned that there &apos;s no boun@@ dar@@ ies , and if i look at the evolution of my work i can see thre@@ ads and connections that make sense .
does the conclusion follow from the premi@@ ses ?
we &apos;ve exten@@ ded this to the air now with a gr@@ ant from the slo@@ an foundation .
and it &apos;s this importance why i decided to look into the issues that this technology has , because it &apos;s so fundamental to our lives .
when you share them , you end up using less .
i had the vege@@ table car@@ vers work on that for me .
and so b@@ .@@ c. in bar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a and b-@@ cycle and bor@@ is bi@@ kes in london -- no one has had to re@@ pe@@ at the version 1.@@ 0 scre@@ w-@@ u@@ ps and expensive learning exerci@@ ses so the opportunity when we &apos;re connected is also to share fail@@ ures and success@@ es .
chip kid@@ d : desig@@ ning books is no laugh@@ ing matter . ok , it is .
these are clim@@ bers moving up the l@@ hot@@ se face , that mountain toward camp three .
for one thing , both were very real .
so , i had to take up a job . and i worked in the phar@@ ma industry .
there &apos;s no way of predi@@ cting the internet based on the first transi@@ stor .
now we &apos;re going to change and look at the level of per capita income .
and instead of char@@ ging a dollar-@@ fi@@ f@@ ty for the ei@@ ght-@@ o@@ un@@ ce bot@@ tle , the way that french &apos;s and g@@ ul@@ den &apos;s did , they decided to charge four dollars .
we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done .
back to some of the more mun@@ dan@@ e issues of thinking about un@@ certain@@ ty .
and that was a stro@@ ke of absolute geni@@ us , because what they did was they har@@ n@@ essed the power of the contract , private power , to deli@@ ver public goo@@ ds .
and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t i look at the news better ? &quot;
i wanted to do something that was working directly with the world , directly with place .
maybe we should see how they do with los@@ ses .
there &apos;s an 8@@ 0-@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar-@@ a-@@ year ec@@ ot@@ ou@@ ri@@ sm revenue stream into africa .
this can lead up to 150 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day .
so i &apos;m going to do it too . we &apos;ll all be there together .
and it &apos;s so simple .
they just talked about it being necessary .
and it &apos;s virtu@@ ally impossible in nature to make that happen .
women lost their ancient jobs as colle@@ ctors , but then with the industrial revolution and the post-@@ industrial revolution they &apos;re moving back into the job market .
text : &quot; there is only time enough to ir@@ on your ca@@ pe and back to the sk@@ ies for you . &quot;
every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page .
now you may say , &quot; okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
but if it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s going to be really miser@@ able and stres@@ s@@ ful . &quot;
he invi@@ ted all the prin@@ ces to come and defe@@ at his daughter at whi@@ st@@ ling .
so to in@@ vo@@ ke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabri@@ c of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you to her , on out end@@ less@@ ly into the distance -- this fabri@@ c is actually like an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned american qu@@ il@@ t , and it has pat@@ ches on it : happy and un@@ happy pat@@ ches .
the hir@@ sh@@ hor@@ n si@@ ts among the m@@ all &apos;s mom@@ um@@ ental institutions .
we &apos;re not done with anat@@ omy . we know a tremendous amount about genomi@@ cs , prote@@ omi@@ cs and cell biology , but as di@@ an@@ e kel@@ ly makes clear at ted@@ med , there are basic facts about the human body we &apos;re still learning . case in point : how does the mamm@@ ali@@ an ere@@ ction work ?
thank you .
so , i was born two days after christmas .
this is grou@@ per sex , and the grou@@ pers aggre@@ gate around the full mo@@ ons of dec@@ ember and janu@@ ary for a week .
you &apos;ll notice that transportation &apos;s sort of second down that list , but that &apos;s the conversation we mostly hear about .
my at@@ tor@@ ney said , &quot; nah , no chance of that working . &quot;
i actually designed that to move faster through the water because i thought that was the thing that we needed to do : to move fast and get range .
and this is me with president obama , showing him my hom@@ el@@ and security research .
and it &apos;s true , i &apos;ve never worked in a hospi@@ ce , i &apos;ve never been on my de@@ ath@@ bed .
he la@@ id down the mathemati@@ cal foun@@ da@@ tions for computer science , and said , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter how you make a computer . &quot;
and one after@@ no@@ on , while he was recor@@ ding , there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game war@@ dens , who for no appar@@ ent reason , walked over to the bea@@ ver da@@ m , dropped a stick of dynami@@ te down it , blo@@ wing it up , killing the female and her young babies .
this is looking at as@@ cen@@ ding versus des@@ cen@@ ding fli@@ ghts .
but with today &apos;s much better technologies , more mat@@ ure deli@@ very chan@@ n@@ els and integra@@ tive design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
1@@ 1@@ th who am i ? isn &apos;t that the biggest question ?
and the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here .
and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas . it uses landscape as a major idea .
i got an almost 100 percent response rate .
and for us , i mean it &apos;s really kind of a very strange thing , but the moments in the hall that the bu@@ zz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin , very similar to the par@@ ting of cur@@ tains or the rais@@ ing of a chan@@ deli@@ er , the walls will just ex@@ u@@ de this glo@@ w , tempor@@ arily ste@@ aling attention from the stage .
and as valuable as that is in los al@@ tos , imagine what that does to the adult lear@@ ner who &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
this is a shot of &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; the movie .
you don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothe@@ sis that i am my connect@@ ome .
and it &apos;s literally done by using what our brains natur@@ ally do for us , which is , as soon as you shift your attention , something changes , and then i left the little sc@@ ar@@ f going , because it really wanted to be a g@@ ho@@ stly shot , really wanted to feel like they were still on the w@@ re@@ ck , essentially . that &apos;s where they were bu@@ ried forever .
so , when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united , because in my dre@@ ams , it was my brain creating electronic sounds . it wasn &apos;t the software , so that &apos;s when i started to feel like a cy@@ bor@@ g .
and then , not only for war victims , but it was for any kind of patient .
so what do we find ? what do we find in the gang ? well , let me say one thing .
so here we have lu@@ dot@@ ru@@ ck , which is in l.a. , doing the things that g@@ our@@ met food trucks do , and they &apos;ve gather@@ ed quite a following .
this is ne@@ da , the ir@@ ani@@ an girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago , and she is now the focus , ri@@ ghtly so , of the youtube generation .
when i say it out l@@ oud , it sounds so ridiculous , but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what , in the alien ab@@ du@@ c@@ tee community , they call a &quot; screen memory &quot; : a ridiculous fal@@ se re@@ colle@@ ction designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kid@@ na@@ pped and flo@@ wn off to a sex pyrami@@ d .
and we developed a pattern together that sc@@ ales to ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ arily large size , but that allows any fl@@ at ring or dis@@ c to fold down into a very ne@@ at , comp@@ act cy@@ lin@@ der .
no water , ro@@ cky soil . &quot;
hil@@ ma : i found out when i went to the hospital for a pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy che@@ ck@@ -up .
i stayed there for three years .
but , nothing else will matter if we fa@@ il to protect the ocean .
they fl@@ ash , and spar@@ k@@ le , and glo@@ w with their own living light .
then we sort of cut up the volume , so we wouldn &apos;t block the view from my apartment .
take the shoes . take the shoes .
it &apos;s called a carbon@@ -@@ oxygen d@@ warf .
so i hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time , and as i say up here , please think before you s@@ w@@ at .
jo@@ ve is a website that was fo@@ unded to encoura@@ ge scientists to publi@@ sh their peer-@@ re@@ viewed research on video .
the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them , but the actual things have to be veri@@ fi@@ able .
there &apos;s a lot more problems like that -- aids , p@@ ne@@ um@@ oni@@ a -- i can just see you &apos;re getting excited , just at the very name of these things .
age is another thing when our at@@ titude toward our appe@@ ar@@ ance changes .
by the time the pilot had finished , we had the names of a thousand schools that wi@@ shed to join .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s be@@ aring con@@ es down the center .
and you want a leader who inspi@@ res and challenges and makes you want to be a better citi@@ zen . right ?
and now , these days , she e@@ ats organic food and she sle@@ e@@ ps on an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c bed with her name on it , but when we po@@ ur water for her in her bo@@ w@@ l , she still looks up and she wa@@ gs her tail in gra@@ titude .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
but bor@@ ders do persi@@ st in some parts of cyber@@ space .
it &apos;s still used , even after the current earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in china .
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn &apos;t have to have a search quer@@ y at all .
and that is the freedom of mobi@@ lity that my great grandfather brought to people is now being thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , just as the environment is .
he &apos;s still ahead of some of the stuff that &apos;s being done now .
it is ourselves we are helping .
now , on the other hand , in the second half of the 20th century , the arts are frequ@@ ently said to be in decline .
the whole emerging world jo@@ ins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the po@@ or@@ est billion .
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
well , of course , as soon as anybody did look , which was after about 20 years , when radio astron@@ omy really took off . because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radi@@ ating in the radio spec@@ trum , much bri@@ gh@@ ter than the sun .
in many cases , bill has left the economy enti@@ r@@ ely , and ted very r@@ ar@@ ely has .
no stone left un@@ turned .
it &apos;s a broken system .
after all , there &apos;s a strong cor@@ relation between water and fishing , and for some , there &apos;s a strong cor@@ relation between fishing and be@@ er .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follo@@ w-@@ up study .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynami@@ cs will continue the way they have .
and , of course , bad for me personally .
but i also know why it &apos;s ex@@ qui@@ site to me , because it &apos;s a pal@@ imp@@ sest of things .
we have a huge problem fac@@ ing us as a species .
for instance , the internet was boom@@ ing in the u.s .
and so i decided to make these pictures , and they were very large , so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them .
many of them are working in deeply in@@ tra@@ ct@@ able systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc .
i was a single british diplomat in new york city ; you can imagine what that might have meant .
think about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
you need more .
could you re@@ generate a limb ?
the soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative jud@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative jud@@ g@@ ments .
and she said , &quot; no , the le@@ go is the tre@@ asure . &quot;
humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because , by and large , we really don &apos;t have to ada@@ pt to our environment ; we ada@@ pt our environment to us .
for@@ ty-@@ eight gover@@ nor@@ s compe@@ ted , convin@@ cing 4@@ 8 state le@@ gi@@ sl@@ atures to essentially raise standards for high scho@@ ol@@ ers so that they all take a college pre@@ p cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
it invol@@ ves provi@@ ding information and education and condoms to reduce hiv trans@@ mission , and also provi@@ ding hiv te@@ sting and coun@@ sel@@ ing and treatment should people become infe@@ cted .
so even when there &apos;s only a small amount of mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure in the air , it &apos;s able to harv@@ est that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth .
this is sur@@ f .
the music works perfe@@ ctly in that setting .
about three and a half years ago i made a discovery .
and when q@@ at@@ ar has been as@@ signed to the world c@@ up all , many people around the world have been wondering , how would it be possible that foot@@ ball players show spect@@ acu@@ lar foot@@ ball , run around in this desert climate ? how would it be possible that spect@@ ators sit , enjoy themselves in open-@@ air sta@@ dia in this hot environment ?
you don &apos;t need a designer , or a plan , or for@@ esi@@ ght , or anything else .
mars has the grand can@@ y@@ on of the solar system , v@@ alles mar@@ in@@ er@@ is .
so now we can look throughout the brain .
now you can imagine at that time i had to switch the ridiculous bo@@ ots for some sli@@ p@@ pers .
they weren &apos;t farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .
if you look carefully , you can even see a hin@@ t of the apple men@@ u , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally pun@@ ched through to the physical .
ed ul@@ br@@ ich , the digi@@ tal@@ -@@ effects gur@@ u from digital dom@@ ain , explains the o@@ sc@@ ar-@@ w@@ inning technology that allowed his team to digi@@ t@@ ally create the older ver@@ sions of bra@@ d pi@@ tt &apos;s face for &quot; the curi@@ ous case of benjamin button . &quot;
and then , so you can get in the dri@@ ver &apos;s side , sit down , and up against you is a wall .
i have some ones that were long la@@ sting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occu@@ pa@@ tion , and it led to a sense of fail@@ ure .
that really is strange . how do we explain this ?
watch this : what i &apos;m going to do is slide the se@@ vent@@ h one onto my foot .
i want to talk about three particular people that i &apos;ve met , vagina war@@ ri@@ ors , who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species , and one is a woman named mar@@ sh@@ a lo@@ pe@@ z .
so that &apos;s the b@@ ert ru@@ tan designed spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p ?
and when they did , they took small@@ po@@ x to 10 other countries and rei@@ gni@@ ted the epidemi@@ c .
yes we can . we can do it .
so , the sequ@@ el to &quot; eli@@ zab@@ eth , &quot; &quot; gol@@ den age . &quot;
now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , i want to define what i mean by revolution .
so that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to ask you to do , but in a slightly different way . you &apos;re going to combine it .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
so i told her .
but because of the rever@@ ber@@ ation in those rooms like car@@ ne@@ gie hall , the music had to be maybe a little less rhyth@@ mic and a little more tex@@ tural .
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
and so whether they &apos;re helping us to become creative and innova@@ tive , or whether they &apos;re helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance , or whether they are our tru@@ sted si@@ de@@ ki@@ ck who &apos;s helping us at@@ tain our personal go@@ als in becoming our highest and best selves , for me , robots are all about people .
and i think you &apos;ll enjoy this building , it &apos;s never been seen -- it &apos;s been still photograph@@ ed , but never photograph@@ ed by a film cre@@ w .
in the 19@@ 20@@ s , we thought there were major differences between people .
i have this little slo@@ gan that i use a lot , which is : virtu@@ ally nothing -- and i mean this hon@@ est@@ ly -- has been invented yet .
i &apos;m very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see pi@@ cas@@ so and mati@@ sse , and then they st@@ um@@ ble upon my show and i keep them there .
and the last thing we want to see is dru@@ g-@@ resi@@ stant stra@@ ins of hiv po@@ pping up all over the world , because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also re@@ store the pre-@@ ar@@ v car@@ na@@ ge of hiv / aids .
i &apos;m still dat@@ ing that guy four years later . &quot;
but then one morning , i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vin@@ cent van go@@ gh .
you don &apos;t have enough time .
the one on the left is the mon@@ key who gets cu@@ cum@@ ber .
this is absolutely cru@@ cial , and virtu@@ ality is da@@ zz@@ ling at deli@@ ver@@ ing this .
the gover@@ nor says , &quot; we will close you . &quot;
and i hope this enti@@ ced your imagination , because i can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur , but when .
it &apos;s only the beginning .
but when i realized that the non-@@ musli@@ m , or the non-@@ islami@@ c@@ -@@ minded ac@@ tors in the same geo@@ graphy , sometimes beha@@ ved simi@@ lar@@ ly , i realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region , not just islam .
i took it out for the first time to come here .
one of them , from anthropolo@@ gy , is the study of human univers@@ als .
one of the problems is coming up with the right target .
even more valuable , history provi@@ des a laborat@@ ory in which we see played out the actual , as well as the inten@@ ded consequences of ideas .
i mean , charlie mo@@ ore did a bunch of it , but it didn &apos;t feel good to me .
and they don &apos;t just guess what makes people happy ; they go to places like la@@ tin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life .
add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
thank you very much .
he had this amazing kni@@ fe that he pulled out of his gh@@ o and started bran@@ di@@ shing when i asked him to make a funny face .
&quot; obviously , you &apos;re intelligent .
and as a young boy , i used to go up to north@@ ern mi@@ chi@@ gan and fish in the ri@@ vers that hem@@ ing@@ way fi@@ shed in and then later wrote about .
her he@@ bre@@ w was not good , and she later con@@ f@@ essed that she thought that i had come to inst@@ all the internet .
but moving to our four@@ th comm@@ and@@ ment , i really wouldn &apos;t be here tonight .
well , the book came out in oc@@ tober , and nothing terrible has happened .
&quot; sh@@ us@@ h , &quot; he says again for the 50@@ 0@@ th time to me .
now , do you really want me to say now , tell you , &quot; really , i swe@@ ar i don &apos;t ki@@ ck children . &quot;
she as@@ sum@@ ed that i did not know how to use a sto@@ ve .
this can &apos;t be my mother .
i &apos;m not going to mini@@ mi@@ ze those concern@@ s .
and i think the message of this is very clear .
it &apos;s been successful beyond our dre@@ ams .
now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page .
funding bar@@ ri@@ ers : another big area to be concerned with .
the gro@@ und@@ water is 300 feet deep , 100 me@@ ters .
so if i have to choose between those two , i would choose the right one because it &apos;s less vari@@ able .
you can literally see them .
no , you will die . 50 percent will die within 24 hours , if not treated .
1.@@ 8 billion people around the world work in the economy that is un@@ regul@@ ated and in@@ for@@ mal .
what am i going to be ? &quot;
i just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
you know , he used to go to a ru@@ g@@ by match and we would win .
there &apos;s not a lot of cli@@ ck@@ iness .
and so we left my father fast as@@ le@@ ep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by her@@ self , and we get in the car .
a 17-@@ year-old student . her wish was to have been born a boy .
the real questions begin when it comes to argu@@ ing about who deser@@ ves what and why .
but that &apos;s when i take out his letters and i read them , and the paper that tou@@ ched his hand is in mine , and i feel connected to him .
and i want to tell you about them each separ@@ ately and then how they interact and why , in the end , there may be some good news .
but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world .
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political co@@ ali@@ tions , loo@@ sely based political co@@ ali@@ tions , to civili@@ za@@ tional co@@ ali@@ tions that are working for the ide@@ als and nar@@ ra@@ tives of the democra@@ tic culture on the ground .
so , the examples that i gave you are these islands of mes@@ h networks , and networks are interesting only as they are big .
and i mean , in the original it &apos;s completely unclear to see what this tan@@ gle of colors and shapes is supposed to de@@ pi@@ ct .
well , the topic i &apos;m going to disc@@ uss is one which is , in a certain sense , very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar because it &apos;s very old .
so , we did another experiment .
so i started thinking , well , we live in all these ages of man : the stone age , and the ir@@ on age , and the cop@@ per age .
i do so many things on this little device .
and that &apos;s the first thing they saw .
j@@ h : 40 to 50 ? yeah .
well , port@@ land is repu@@ ted to have the most roof ra@@ cks per capita , the most independent book@@ stores per capita , the most stri@@ p clu@@ bs per capita .
and in the end , you got so quick , that things like &quot; flight of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ bee &quot; were no problem , were they ?
we need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it .
we forget about all of our new mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class fru@@ stra@@ tions and disa@@ p@@ poin@@ t@@ ments , and we feel like milli@@ on@@ air@@ es .
we learned of mar@@ shall ka@@ y &apos;s geo@@ syn@@ clin@@ al cycle , which is a bunch of cra@@ p .
and they get depres@@ sed and they get sad on their own .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , thank you very much . sho@@ kr@@ an .
i would put it in the following equation : no 9 / 11 , no war .
so , anyone want to see the 3@@ 2 patients that pra@@ y for 60 minutes a day , and see if they &apos;re doing better , they probably are .
these kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
and it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that i had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot .
you &apos;re dri@@ ven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
yes , we ran this as a business , but someone needed to pay the phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ pi@@ c support that came into the training , and the management support , the strategi@@ c ad@@ vi@@ ce and , maybe most important of all , the access to new cont@@ acts , networks and new markets .
what &apos;s interesting about it is not the shape .
from her , i learned , am@@ on@@ gst many other things , one very preci@@ ous lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a ble@@ mi@@ sh or the human soul , all you need to do is to surro@@ und it with thi@@ ck walls .
they said , &quot; yes , but it &apos;s sum@@ mer@@ time . &quot;
what i am saying though is that human beings are not one-@@ dimensional .
and those al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , wh@@ il@@ st being kind of useful , are also very , very nar@@ row , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
i packa@@ ged them up three ways .
the trees , by the way , are often prefer@@ red if they for@@ k near the ground , that is to say , if they &apos;re trees you could sc@@ ra@@ m@@ ble up if you were in a ti@@ ght fix .
for the sa@@ ke of the kids , for the sa@@ ke of the family , for the sa@@ ke of the community , for the sa@@ ke of the future , let &apos;s stop fighting for a moment and start talking .
so he says -- i &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent -- he says , &quot; for some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entro@@ py for its energy content , and since then the entro@@ py has increased .
and i &apos;m going to just close on a very som@@ ber note .
so we &apos;ve studied sexu@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us .
we &apos;re all going to eventually , even in the developed world , going to have to lose everything that we love .
can you see that one ?
at the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up and we didn &apos;t pick up one par@@ ent .
he clo@@ ses it down for five months to experiment with a full kit@@ chen staff .
that &apos;s what this is about .
but as soon as it starts to fl@@ ash -- and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blo@@ oms on the camera -- i want you to look right here .
i mean , it could be somebody &apos;s health , it could be somebody &apos;s career , something important to them .
and in this way , you can take the gu@@ ess@@ work out of poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making by knowing what works , what doesn &apos;t work and why .
we can look at our own history . the late physi@@ cist ger@@ ard o &apos;@@ nei@@ ll said , &quot; advanced western civilization has had a destru@@ ctive effect on all primitive civili@@ zations it has come in cont@@ act with , even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and gu@@ ard the primitive civilization . &quot;
so , for example , you can be a pi@@ t@@ cher or a cat@@ cher , and that cor@@ respon@@ ds to whether you perform a sexu@@ al act or recei@@ ve a sexu@@ al act .
we got a mi@@ so@@ g@@ y@@ n@@ ist admini@@ str@@ ator sending us hat@@ e-@@ mail fi@@ red from a big ten school .
here &apos;s the di@@ le@@ m@@ ma ...
to try this one , the ma@@ ker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan sho@@ w@@ room .
we see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affe@@ cted countries .
we talked about in@@ er@@ ti@@ a and organ don@@ ations and che@@ cking the box .
so , for example , this fish has a buil@@ t-@@ in head@@ light behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attra@@ cting a mate .
even in stories on gen@@ der@@ -@@ based violence , men get an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming maj@@ ority of print space and air@@ time .
to this end , i have worked in sugar for stefan sag@@ meister , three-@@ time ted speaker .
they stal@@ k bli@@ ss@@ ful cou@@ ples and they study their every move and man@@ n@@ eri@@ sm .
i mean , if you had to solve one of these problems , chris , which would you solve ? terror@@ ism or poverty ?
well my theory is that it &apos;s happening because cen@@ sor@@ ship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places .
so my story is a tale of two brains , because it might surprise you , our gut has a full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged brain .
so depen@@ ding on where it looks , it fli@@ ps between the two possibilities .
it is a home@@ o@@ sta@@ tic im@@ balance .
and so now i &apos;m going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it &apos;s never just sing@@ ul@@ arly one thing .
and that &apos;s how we do it .
and one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful mes@@ sa@@ ges , and he was dres@@ sed as bat@@ man .
you can &apos;t raise money .
much later , robert ma@@ ill@@ art &apos;s bri@@ d@@ ges , which optimi@@ ze stru@@ ctural form with a calcul@@ us cur@@ v@@ ature almost like a par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a .

i started with a po@@ em , i &apos;ll end with one .
and because it has two different co@@ effici@@ ents of expansion , when he@@ ated , one side will exp@@ and faster than the other and result in a cur@@ ling action .
in fact , when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago , they were able to measure a wo@@ bble within the earth as it was sp@@ inning .
fantastic tal@@ es , an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es from speak@@ ers .
you put a little piece of ri@@ ce in the foot of a pengu@@ in that has a bar@@ code , so it tells you who it is .
i don &apos;t want to ad@@ verti@@ se them too much ; that &apos;s not the point .
and then we moved on into an era in the 19@@ th century with the rise of a european nation@@ -@@ state where identi@@ ties and alle@@ gi@@ an@@ ces were defined by ethni@@ city .
we worry that im , tex@@ ting , facebook are spo@@ iling human inti@@ ma@@ cy , but ste@@ fan@@ a broad@@ b@@ ent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cul@@ tiv@@ ating de@@ e@@ per relationships , bringing love across bar@@ ri@@ ers like distance and work@@ place rules .
the left has been scre@@ aming about this a@@ ster@@ o@@ id for 30 years now , and the right says , &quot; hu@@ h , what ? hm@@ m ? no problem . no problem . &quot;
when that happens , you provide people with multiple ways of re-@@ ent@@ ering the world through different windows , and when you do that , it allows them to tri@@ an@@ gu@@ late the world that they live in and see its shape .
at the turn of the century , the internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central ner@@ v@@ ous system .
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
whether you think about immedi@@ ate gra@@ tifi@@ cation , and the cho@@ col@@ ates versus banan@@ as , it &apos;s just pain@@ ful to save now .
bad experiences quickly disappear .
but the one that &apos;s really been sort of stres@@ sing me out , that i haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this p@@ hrase &quot; cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , gal@@ vao . &quot;
according to paul and an@@ ne ehrlich and a well-@@ known environmental impact equation , impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology .
which , it turned out , for this black gang , was not one of the more brilliant financial en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s that they under@@ took .
the best civil engine@@ ers we had , the best plan@@ ners , the best archite@@ cts .
this has come &apos; ro@@ und to be that all those na@@ ked pa@@ ch@@ y@@ der@@ ms have a@@ qu@@ atic ancestors .
they accu@@ mu@@ late the solar energy .
the gang leader always got paid , ok ?
and then someone goes off and sa@@ ves the world because they &apos;ve been told to , with a few people ta@@ gging along .
and on top of it , the ju@@ i@@ cy sal@@ if .
i &apos;ll just describe how this works .
then i paid my entire way through first year university at car@@ l@@ ton by s@@ elling wine s@@ kin@@ s door to door .
someone spe@@ a@@ ks , there &apos;s reson@@ ance in all these recei@@ ving brains , the whole group acts together .
and their individual visions , and their engagement with this mathemati@@ cal mode .
secon@@ dly , a political the@@ or@@ ist who &apos;s going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
and some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
look at it here : 39 digi@@ ts long , pro@@ ven to be prime in 18@@ 7@@ 6 by a mathemati@@ cian called luc@@ as .
and i dou@@ bt anybody in this room could really hold their bre@@ ath for 3@@ .@@ 5 minutes .
but now it &apos;s not fall@@ ing , because there , with help from pep@@ far , it &apos;s working with treatment . and people are not dying .
for instance , there are 21 states in our country where corpo@@ ral p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wo@@ o@@ den board , hard , and rais@@ ing large bru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ sters and even brea@@ king the skin .
so a me@@ gab@@ y@@ te , 26 million me@@ gab@@ ytes is 26 ter@@ ab@@ ytes -- it goes mega@@ - , gi@@ ga@@ - , ter@@ a@@ - . 26 ter@@ ab@@ ytes .
as we go around , we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down , but we also learn about how no@@ is@@ y our own sen@@ sor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us is , and then combine those in a real ba@@ ye@@ si@@ an way .
so window farms have been evol@@ ving through a rapid ver@@ sion@@ ing process similar to software .
there is no cure , but there &apos;s something that sometimes works -- it usually doesn &apos;t -- called high-@@ do@@ sage inter@@ leu@@ kin .
and fe@@ ars and story@@ telling have the same components .
proteins are tar@@ gets for drugs .
so the notion , you change the soil , the seed doesn &apos;t grow as well .
thank you .
it doesn &apos;t radi@@ ate .
getting that text was like getting a hu@@ g .
the whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
and you are seeing , now , that data being trans@@ posed on to ben 8@@ 7 .
so they took me . i was a message , they said .
but look what we just did today .
so , as we move forward into this technological future , i want you to just p@@ ause and think of that for a moment .
i ta@@ ped my a@@ unt . i ta@@ ped my a@@ unt singing a song in russi@@ an from the -- you know , could we have it for a second ?
i fell through my apartment door and cra@@ w@@ led to the ba@@ th@@ room where i found my problem : i had for@@ gotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine .
every 30 seconds , somewhere on this planet , a child dies of malaria , and paul le@@ vy this morning , he was talking about the metaphor of the 7@@ 27 cr@@ as@@ hing into the united states .
and this is the kind of city that &apos;s de@@ void of smell , de@@ void of mess , certainly de@@ void of people , because nobody would have dre@@ amed of walking in such a landscape .
and as this article points out , &quot; the average native of any city in china knows nothing of cho@@ p su@@ ey . &quot;
so now that eg@@ ypti@@ ans have ended mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s 3@@ 0-@@ year rule , they poten@@ tially could be an example for the region .
the seti institute &apos;s j@@ ill tar@@ ter makes her prize wish : to acceler@@ ate our search for co@@ smi@@ c company . using a growing ar@@ ray of radio telescop@@ es , she and her team listen for patterns that may be a sign of intelligence el@@ se@@ where in the universe .
it per@@ va@@ des basically everything that we do .
yeah , good . yeah .
this guy had met hit@@ ler and gand@@ hi within six months , and every time i &apos;d ask him about it , he &apos;d say , &quot; oh , i just happened to be there .
and that &apos;s the sho@@ ck of recogni@@ tion at the sho@@ ck of recogni@@ tion .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the hon@@ ey .
what the hon@@ ey bee does : it pollin@@ ates , takes ne@@ c@@ tar from the flower , pollin@@ ates another flower , cros@@ s-@@ pollin@@ ates .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s great . &quot;
so i said , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re all in this yourself . you teach : it &apos;s gener@@ o@@ sity , &quot; was all i could think of . what is virtu@@ e ?
in 199@@ 6 , he shot himself in the head on dec@@ ember nin@@ th -- which inci@@ d@@ entally is ju@@ di den@@ ch &apos;s birthday .
steve would later tell me that , for all the times he had seen me psy@@ cho@@ tic , nothing could have prepar@@ ed him for what he saw that day .
we know it takes a lot to make it happen , and we know the direction the world is going in .
and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture , there &apos;s a lot of water as well , which wasn &apos;t there histori@@ cally .
it &apos;s something we fight . it &apos;s something we over@@ come .
and you see that when you di@@ stor@@ t a map based on attention , the world within american television news is basically redu@@ ced to this giant blo@@ ated u.s .
now , we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world -- these tiny sens@@ ors that ga@@ ther data in nature , the u@@ bi@@ qui@@ t@@ ous computing that allows that data to be understood and used , and of course the social networks that allow people to collabor@@ ate and contribu@@ te .
this is all i have . i have a couple of facts about somebody .
when ro@@ mo wa@@ kes up , he &apos;s in creature mode .
but u@@ ma@@ r is a fantastic student . he &apos;s an incredible kid .
you stand up , and you sk@@ im the stone .
can you p@@ ly your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
and she was thinking about her friends and family who work in cha@@ o@@ s-@@ ri@@ dden places and developing countries , and she was thinking , what can i make that would be of value to them , in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the bor@@ der or pay off a g@@ un@@ man ?
i am just one of a new generation that is growing up .
what trou@@ b@@ les me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence , but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game .
we , at this time of year , get lots of traffic j@@ ams .
and three years ago , one of the things i learned how to do was to become invi@@ sible .
this caused major ri@@ ots in my city .
the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same bi@@ ases .
that means we &apos;d go from 4@@ 4,000 to 18@@ 0,000 .
and you played with them for a few hours .
it &apos;s not just what you see in the picture .
it &apos;s being used now to track where counter@@ f@@ eit drugs have been made , where ban@@ k@@ notes have come from , to look at the pro@@ ven@@ ance of anti@@ ques and see that they really did come from the place the s@@ eller said they did .
let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essen@@ ti@@ als can be .
so you could fit 10 human cells across the diam@@ e@@ ter of a human hair .
he imag@@ ined an integr@@ ated transportation system in which it would be possible for a pas@@ sen@@ ger to embar@@ k on a train in london and dise@@ m@@ bar@@ k from a ship in new york .
good@@ ness knows what they make of the la@@ ke distri@@ ct weather .
there are no quick fi@@ xes .
one is fast food , where everything is standar@@ di@@ zed .
so i &apos;ll end with the new version .
look at this . this is the site of the government of india .
and that &apos;s what he did .
so i want to show you a cli@@ p of ap@@ ha@@ en@@ o@@ ga@@ ster desert ants in professor stephen pr@@ at@@ t &apos;s lab carrying an object .
i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
and i thought , well , since i can &apos;t go to the movi@@ es , at least i will go for free to listen to flying sau@@ cers .
for the bar@@ ga@@ in price of a few thousand dollars , there are clini@@ cs in the u.s. that will give you one of these spe@@ ct sc@@ ans and use the image to help diagno@@ se your problems .
math is logical , functional and just ... a@@ wes@@ ome . mathe@@ magi@@ cian arth@@ ur benjamin explor@@ es hidden properties of that weird and wonderful set of numbers , the fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series .
we feel that this is an important gest@@ ure .
now i don &apos;t know if anybody knows who this is .
and as a result -- once we got over a little hur@@ d@@ le , and having to audi@@ tion twice -- they accep@@ ted me . and not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary l@@ eng@@ ths to be able to watch this program .
well , to love well and to work well , you need wisdom .
we form people into groups and make them go into challenges .
i heard about disease , i heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related .
but we all had to change , but not just re@@ act to the given ; we ben@@ d to this new experience with in@@ tent .
so really the resol@@ ution is quite incredible .
now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here .
in other words , i &apos;ve taken off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ shelf components , and i &apos;ve made a spect@@ ro@@ scop@@ e .
so , here &apos;s steven alone , sharing this story in the world .
i &apos;m going to make india &#91; into &#93; a 100-@@ per@@ cent@@ -@@ s@@ ani@@ tar@@ y-@@ nap@@ kin@@ -@@ using country in my life@@ time .
and they end up looking like stone .
anyway , i &apos;m i@@ ri@@ sh , and as you can see , i know how important talking is .
&quot; and we talked -- i talked to them about movember , and then after that , my dad came up to me , and at the age of 26 , for the first time ever , i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men &apos;s health . i had a conversation with my dad about pro@@ state cancer , and i learned that my grandfather had pro@@ state cancer and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease , and he didn &apos;t know that , and he hadn &apos;t been getting scre@@ en@@ ed for it . &quot;
un@@ like the sm@@ ash@@ ed glass of my car , plasti@@ city of the brain means that there was always a possibility , with treatment , to train the brain so that you can re@@ ga@@ in and raise your level of awareness and consciousness .
so as i go through this talk , i want you to imagine this gigan@@ tic machine . we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have so@@ unded like .
what i &apos;ll try and do , is i &apos;ll try and par@@ ap@@ hrase it is sort of human terms .
so we talked about all sorts of behavi@@ or@@ al challenges having to do with sa@@ vings eventually .
the animal could be a cow , lam@@ b , or even something more exo@@ tic .
second conclusion is that the ability to con@@ cei@@ ve of a given ev@@ ent in two different ways , such as &quot; cause something to go to someone &quot; and &quot; caus@@ ing someone to have something , &quot; i think is a fundamental fe@@ ature of human thought , and it &apos;s the basis for much human argu@@ ment@@ ation , in which people don &apos;t diff@@ er so much on the facts as on how they ought to be constru@@ ed .
ja@@ mi@@ e dru@@ m@@ mond : fewer children every day .
we &apos;ve been evol@@ ving just as long , just along different pa@@ ths .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reve@@ al .
and we can see this happening over the last four billion years .
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral -- it &apos;s not .
1@@ 65 .
maybe a coming of age in the american sen@@ su@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness , never seeing an uns@@ mu@@ d@@ ged ni@@ pp@@ le , an un@@ cen@@ sor@@ ed vagina , has left me forever infe@@ cted with an un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able lu@@ st of the eye .
and a lot of what goes on inside ...
if you talk to fac@@ ul@@ ty , they may say , &quot; u@@ gh . yeah , well , they &apos;re playing video games , and they &apos;re gam@@ bling online all night long , and they &apos;re playing world of war@@ craft , and that &apos;s affe@@ cting their academic achi@@ ev@@ ement . &quot;
the international stage and the global stage where power now resi@@ des : the power of the internet , the power of the satellite broad@@ ca@@ sters , the power of the money chan@@ gers -- this vast mon@@ e@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ ro@@ und that cir@@ cul@@ ates now 3@@ 2 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it &apos;s supposed to be there to fin@@ ance -- the money chan@@ gers , if you like , the financial spe@@ cul@@ ators that have brought us all to our kne@@ es quite recently , the power of the multina@@ tional corpo@@ ra@@ tions now developing budgets often bigger than medi@@ um@@ -@@ si@@ zed countries .
and it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing , again , lots in rio .
refer@@ en@@ cing steven john@@ son &apos;s very lo@@ vely speech yesterday on where ideas come from , i was in the sho@@ wer at the time -- i was alone .
the second is maybe more pro@@ sa@@ ic , which is h@@ ong kon@@ g .
i had more supp@@ lies lower down , which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp .
but if more nest ma@@ inten@@ ance work is needed -- for example , if i put out a bunch of to@@ oth@@ pi@@ cks -- then nobody will ever switch back to nest ma@@ inten@@ ance , they have to get nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers from inside the nest .
you &apos;d have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back@@ -up .
how many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
so you &apos;re not hel@@ pl@@ ess at the pu@@ mp .
so my bo@@ ss wouldn &apos;t let me go and see clients .
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe .
it recently came out that experts tri@@ aling drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , pri@@ mar@@ ily on male animals and then , pri@@ mar@@ ily on men .
it was built in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s by robert moses .
and then the char@@ ges of tre@@ as@@ on were dropped .
in fact , they live in a 12-@@ dimensional space .
we can continue to enjoy our food , and we continue to eat well , and we can eat even better .
why didn &apos;t you just call it the con@@ stitu@@ tion so i knew what you were talking about ?
it can be worth up to one trilli@@ on dollars , being paid in bri@@ bes every year , or equal to india &apos;s gd@@ p .
how they got slowly ri@@ cher and ri@@ cher , and they add statistics .
and for those of us that have an environmental element to us , there is something like 40 billion dis@@ pos@@ able batter@@ ies built every year for power that , generally speaking , is used within a few in@@ ches or a few feet of where there is very in@@ expensive power .
it &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
here &apos;s what it looks like in 2002 , 2006 , 2008 .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y scientist david deut@@ sch puts theore@@ tical physics on the back bur@@ ner to disc@@ uss a more ur@@ gen@@ t matter : the survival of our species . the first step toward sol@@ ving global warming , he says , is to ad@@ mit that we have a problem .
life happens .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
remember that 80 percent is dest@@ ined to be lost .
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; car@@ ne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . &quot;
because obviously the public are not professional product designers .
one of the sentences was , &quot; some jobs are ja@@ ils . &quot;
hil@@ ary c@@ ot@@ ta@@ m , charlie le@@ ad@@ be@@ ater , and hu@@ go man@@ as@@ sei of partici@@ ple have taken this idea of participa@@ tion , and in their manifest@@ o enti@@ tled be@@ veri@@ dge 4@@ .@@ 0 , they are sug@@ gest@@ ing a fra@@ me@@ work for rein@@ venting the wel@@ f@@ are state .
if any child is found viol@@ ating these rules , he is sever@@ ely re@@ pri@@ m@@ and@@ ed .
so , something has got to give . and that is what i want .
why do we cra@@ ve love so much , even to the point that we would die for it ? to learn more about our very real , very physical need for roman@@ tic love , hel@@ en fi@@ sher and her research team took mr@@ is of people in love -- and people who had just been du@@ mp@@ ed .
i thre@@ w it into an or@@ bit , and it only had one color , and when it got to the center , the pain@@ t kept running out , so i had to run in there , didn &apos;t have any control over the spi@@ got re@@ mot@@ ely .
so we worked on impro@@ ving the produ@@ ctivity of the oper@@ ations and the supply cha@@ in , and went to a low-@@ mar@@ gin , high-@@ volume , absolutely certain@@ -@@ pa@@ y@@ ment business .
and these exi@@ sted for tens of millions of years .
so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of &apos; 6@@ 8 -- ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless that most of us had been even not born then .
it &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleas@@ ur@@ able , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
in his 20@@ s , he was a hot@@ shot ad execu@@ tive , and as ma@@ d men has told us , a ra@@ ging al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic .
but then there &apos;s this other self , the future self .
and everybody of course knows that the feder@@ al government de@@ bt is growing as a share of gd@@ p at a very rapid rate , and the only way that &apos;s going to stop is some combin@@ ation of faster growth in ta@@ xes or slo@@ wer growth in enti@@ tle@@ ments , also called trans@@ fer pa@@ y@@ ments .
the mo@@ squ@@ e where the respe@@ ct@@ ful foreig@@ ner is sho@@ wered with bl@@ ess@@ ings and with tears , and wel@@ com@@ ed as a gift .

we &apos;re producing spaces that ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date human activity .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosop@@ her , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
and so now what we &apos;re looking at , as the projects get larger in scale , as they interface with bro@@ a@@ der problems , that they exp@@ and the cap@@ abilities in terms of their performance .
you might look at mi@@ chi@@ gan and say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in producing the gu@@ ts for the electri@@ c vehicle , like the li@@ thi@@ um i@@ on battery .
how can you say that a sle@@ d@@ ge@@ hammer is better than a ball@@ -@@ pe@@ en hammer ? &quot;
they start over here , they love people &apos;s eyes , and it rema@@ ins quite stable .
looking through the lens of resili@@ ence , we really question how we &apos;ve let ourselves get into a situation that &apos;s so vulnerable .
turns out , the monkeys play it safe too .
now , imagine all that negative energy in there .
by now , we &apos;re used to le@@ tting facebook and twitter cap@@ ture our social lives on the web -- building a &quot; social la@@ yer &quot; on top of the real world . in his talk , se@@ th p@@ rie@@ bat@@ sch looks at the next la@@ yer in progress : the &quot; game la@@ yer , &quot; a per@@ va@@ sive net of behavi@@ or@@ -@@ ste@@ ering game dynami@@ cs that will res@@ ha@@ pe education and commer@@ ce . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
these are men and women who can sense the pres@@ ence of distant at@@ oll@@ s of islands beyond the vi@@ sible horiz@@ on , simply by watching the rever@@ ber@@ ation of waves across the h@@ ul@@ l of their ves@@ sel , knowing full well that every island group in the pac@@ i@@ fic has its unique re@@ fra@@ ctive pattern that can be read with the same per@@ spi@@ c@@ acity with which a for@@ en@@ si@@ c scientist would read a finger@@ print .
you &apos;ve got the re@@ d-@@ hat tri@@ athle@@ tes over there .
and what we find if we p@@ lot up the well-@@ known species is this sort of a distribu@@ tion .

science actually says we will live forever .
road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa .
li@@ ke@@ wise , people are also saying , but what about the iraq war ?
when bil@@ ba@@ o was finished and i looked at it , i saw all the mi@@ stakes , i saw ...
and for many decades now there have been a series of t@@ oms satelli@@ tes that have colle@@ cted data about the radiation of the earth &apos;s surface .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sen@@ sor@@ y feed@@ back is extremely no@@ is@@ y .
the bio@@ diversity and the bio@@ density in the ocean is higher , in places , than it is in the rain@@ forests .
atmosphere is great for us ; it allows us to survive here on earth .
we sil@@ ence them . we make them feel gu@@ il@@ ty for being smart . we get them to be@@ have , to t@@ one it down , not to be too inten@@ se .
now it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story -- that &apos;s powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
this is a bio@@ -@@ mor@@ phi@@ c building .
but not just work . it &apos;s within these tri@@ bes that societies get built , that important things happen .
there &apos;s something in new york city .
that &apos;s the value of living .
it was true .
and the second reason is because , wh@@ ere@@ as in europe and north america , the state &apos;s power is continu@@ ously challen@@ ged -- i mean in the european tradition , histori@@ cally against the church , against other se@@ ctors of the ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ cy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on -- for 1,000 years , the power of the chinese state has not been challen@@ ged .

i &apos;ve taken some ideas from the star@@ rs and from many other families i met .
this is real af@@ m -- at@@ omi@@ c force microscop@@ e -- data from my colleagues in the soli@@ d state ligh@@ ting and energy center .
there &apos;s a lot of research showing that to solve co@@ oper@@ ative problems , it really helps .
due to his inst@@ ability , re@@ zero is always in motion . now here &apos;s the trick .
you have to look in our brains to understand why they &apos;re sweet .
but when you start to read the article by cli@@ ff , who himself is a cancer survi@@ vor , who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents dro@@ ve him from new york city to up@@ state new york to get an experim@@ ental therapy for -- at the time -- ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s disease , which saved his life , he makes remarkable points here .
with indepen@@ dence , the whole approach of community getting involved was embra@@ ced by our new government .
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cu@@ red or changed or elimin@@ ated .
the intri@@ c@@ ac@@ ies of scale that come out of that -- you know , in the example of the no@@ se to the face , there &apos;s a fra@@ c@@ tional par@@ t-@@ to-@@ whole idea .
if you think about the problem of banan@@ as versus cho@@ col@@ ates , we think we &apos;re going to eat banan@@ as next week .
let &apos;s take it on a mai@@ den vo@@ y@@ age .
i do have to say , somebody -- i read recently that van go@@ gh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psy@@ cho@@ tic , that he might have had tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be sei@@ zur@@ es , and that might have caused his sp@@ ur@@ t of creativity , and i don &apos;t -- i suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
far@@ ming was an energy bon@@ an@@ z@@ a .
all right . stay strong . peace .
you can draw your simple stick figure , and then it collabor@@ ates with you to create , sort of , like , a post-@@ war ger@@ man et@@ ching .
here india can look at what is happening in the west and el@@ se@@ where , and look at what needs to be done .
third , that tho@@ u shall have rever@@ ence .
i was sure of it .
you can also to@@ g@@ gle between altitude for model and manufac@@ tur@@ er .
this is the second extraordinary photograph i &apos;m going to show you .
and that is , instin@@ ctively we &apos;ve gone out and clim@@ bed over difficult places , went to more ho@@ sti@@ le places , and found out later , maybe to our surprise , that that &apos;s the reason we survived .
so if you had a time you did something , and after you did it you thought to yourself , i can &apos;t believe i said that , i can &apos;t believe i did that , that was so stupid -- who &apos;s been there ?
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without plat@@ in@@ um .
he was mostly interested in ink b@@ lea@@ ching .
the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of my husband &apos;s mat@@ ern@@ al cl@@ an , nen@@ et kat@@ cha , is now appro@@ aching the age of 100 , as far as we can tell .
it puts a human face on issues which , from a@@ far , can appe@@ ar abstract or ide@@ ological or mon@@ um@@ ental in their global impact .
i don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
i realized that , though car@@ ol had died , that core piece of her had not died at all , but had lived on very determin@@ e@@ dly in my brain . &quot;
and once you &apos;ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be as@@ signed or ma@@ pped to any computing platform , appli@@ cation or device .
and the resources that we use are not this two-@@ dimensional s@@ wat@@ h of land that we have .
and after a few moments , her therap@@ ist tries a new t@@ ack , and they start singing together , and gab@@ by starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she s@@ ings , in one des@@ cen@@ ding scale , she s@@ ings , &quot; let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
the second challenge was cells .
we don &apos;t have to do it that way any@@ more .
thank you .
so i want to show you some cognitive illu@@ sions , or deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making illu@@ sions , in the same way .
i &apos;ve seen sort of ok pictures of by@@ catch , the animals acci@@ d@@ entally s@@ co@@ op@@ ed up while fishing for a specific species .
in fact , only one third of agri@@ cultural out@@ put produced in africa even re@@ a@@ ches the market .
and instead of a bal@@ an@@ ced information diet , you can end up surro@@ unded by information jun@@ k food .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
amy cu@@ d@@ dy : so a hand@@ sha@@ ke , or the lack of a hand@@ sha@@ ke , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
i &apos;m saying we need more than just , you know , v@@ acc@@ ination , malaria , aids , because i want to be treated in a pro@@ per hospital if something happens to me out there .
we thought the hi@@ tt@@ ing-@@ it@@ -@@ out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ box number was 1@@ 50,000 nets a year .
but all that a@@ side , we still have a problem , and it &apos;s a real problem .
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha .
so we went over into michael &apos;s garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff , and we put a pi@@ pe in the vi@@ ce there , and scre@@ wed a cap on the end of the pi@@ pe , dri@@ ll@@ ed a hole in the back of the pi@@ pe , took some of our fi@@ re@@ cra@@ ck@@ ers , pulled out the f@@ uses , ti@@ ed them together , put them in the back there , and -- down in that hole -- and then stu@@ ff@@ ed some of our g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der down that pi@@ pe and put three ball be@@ ar@@ ings on the top , in the garage .
audience : go on .
so i do believe this is an idea which has arri@@ ved , but simply not imple@@ mented .
now these chimpanze@@ es are using tools , and we take that as a sign of their intelligence .
so , wel@@ come to oxford , la@@ dies and gentle@@ men .
but design , for some reason , is still mis@@ understood for de@@ cor@@ ation .
we set up a foundation .
so they know what to do .
so we re@@ cru@@ it some people for an experiment .
there is no inher@@ ent meaning in information .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic down@@ turn we had .
you can see bri@@ d@@ get in africa who just ma@@ pped a road in senegal .
there &apos;s just bl@@ ame .
and most importantly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
now , put it this way : what ways of thinking about justice and mor@@ ality under@@ lie the arguments we have over marri@@ age ?
thank you , thank you , thank you .
they con@@ tain thousands of years of their own hi@@ stories within themselves , and they also con@@ tain recor@@ ds of natural and human events .
think of the huge change that means : any business that wants to bi@@ d for a government contract can see what currently is being spent .
&quot; now you &apos;ll get it , you ras@@ cal ! &quot; was the response .
well , guess what ? people that don &apos;t play a lot of action games , that don &apos;t actually spend a lot of time in front of scre@@ ens , have normal , or what we call corre@@ cti@@ ve-@@ to-@@ normal vision . that &apos;s okay .
many patients like that fa@@ vor radiation therapy .
so what pi@@ pa and s@@ op@@ a risk doing is taking a cent@@ uri@@ es@@ -@@ old legal concept , inno@@ cent until pro@@ ven gu@@ il@@ ty , and rever@@ sing it -- gu@@ il@@ ty until pro@@ ven inno@@ cent .
but dan@@ ny mill@@ er , who is a very good anthropolo@@ gist who is working on fi@@ li@@ pin@@ a migr@@ ant women who leave their children back in the phili@@ pp@@ ines , was telling me about how much par@@ ent@@ ing is going on through sky@@ pe , and how much these mothers are enga@@ ged with their children through sky@@ pe .
but rather than making war ine@@ vi@@ table by vie@@ wing this as ide@@ ological , we would be wise to se@@ ek ways to make peace possible .
i literally could not sle@@ ep thinking about , &quot; i wonder how you &apos;d roll over with no sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders . &quot;
in 199@@ 4 , i walked into a prison in cam@@ bo@@ dia , and i met a 12-@@ year-old boy who had been tor@@ tured and was deni@@ ed access to coun@@ sel .
so this is my sing campaig@@ n .
and what do they do when they &apos;re there ?
he went around and told people what he believed .
you &apos;ll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you &apos;ll find senegal , down here -- the same rate as united states .
it &apos;s to be re@@ minded that we are creatures that in@@ hab@@ it this ocean of air .
since 198@@ 9 , the country has per@@ formed at a dou@@ ble@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it rate if you know nothing about china and the so@@ vi@@ et union other than the fact about their tele@@ phones , you would have made a poor predi@@ ction about their economic growth in the next two decades .
here it &apos;s &quot; c@@ and@@ y@@ city . &quot;
you should just come across to see how well our children do .
and o@@ ct@@ op@@ us are , they live in all the oceans .
have you ever wondered why extre@@ mis@@ m seems to have been on the rise in mus@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ ority countries over the course of the last decade ?
you don &apos;t need to know where these recei@@ vers are , and it doesn &apos;t matter if these recei@@ vers move -- just think of the stere@@ o in your car .
they tell me how much you care ...
but there is something more profound here , something de@@ e@@ per .
intui@@ tion is a tool essential in my life .
wow . and so you &apos;re talking to people here at ted to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream ?
you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself .
and so one of the recor@@ ds that we had was this so@@ ot@@ y s@@ hear@@ water , which under@@ goes these spect@@ acu@@ lar mi@@ gra@@ tions all the way from new ze@@ al@@ and all the way up to al@@ as@@ ka and back again in search of end@@ less summer as they complete their life cycles .
these four dri@@ vers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper@@ -@@ consumption , towards the 21@@ st century , defined by collabor@@ ative consumption .
but this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ ve@@ yed in the united states since 195@@ 6 say that their life is very happy .
i &apos;m just going to men@@ tion a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it , so that you also see how much un@@ lo@@ cked potential .
so , one question i often get after this talk -- so i figured i &apos;d answer it now -- is , well , what happens to the animal ?
they slow the flow of technologies .
as a fren@@ ch@@ man , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectu@@ als that think happiness is not at all interesting .
when you think about that , let me go back to what li@@ on@@ el tri@@ ll@@ ing , in his se@@ minal book on authenti@@ city , &quot; sin@@ c@@ eri@@ ty and authenti@@ city &quot; -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the se@@ minal point at which authenti@@ city ent@@ ered the lexi@@ con , if you will .
well we &apos;ve shown you that gn@@ p per capita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
and i want to say we &apos;ve an@@ ni@@ hil@@ ated it in men as well as in women .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
so this is when i ran out of my ide@@ ali@@ sm and decided to qu@@ it my n@@ go job and actually study how the internet could im@@ pe@@ de democra@@ ti@@ zation .
and if you &apos;re talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-@@ conflict sett@@ ings , then you must talk about women , because they are the population you have left .
three sett@@ ings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clo@@ cked in , when you clo@@ cked in to an office , when you clo@@ cked in to a factory , there was no cont@@ act for the whole du@@ ration of the time , there was no cont@@ act with your private sphere .
so we would take the landscape and we would build up the to@@ po@@ graphy .
he has produced some power gener@@ ators , which we are now doing an experiment in banglades@@ h , in two villa@@ ges where cow man@@ ure is producing bio@@ gas , which is running these gener@@ ators .
they throw up anti-@@ access , are@@ a-@@ deni@@ al as@@ ym@@ metri@@ cal strategi@@ es .
and that &apos;s a really important thing to understand , is that the vast maj@@ ority of the edi@@ ts that go on on the website are from a very clo@@ se-@@ kn@@ it community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in con@@ stant communication .
it &apos;s just not practi@@ cal .
there was no marketing . there were no national brand@@ s .
thank you .
what experiments would you run ?
it &apos;s about people doing their bit to produce a little bit , and it all conne@@ cting .
so , i said , &quot; okay well we can &apos;t do that . then we can do something har@@ der . &quot;
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .
we can do it as an out@@ patient proce@@ d@@ ure .
the first thing , as i said , is going to be virtual stun@@ t@@ men .
even for am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans .
y@@ 2@@ k + 10 was coming , the baby boom@@ ers starting to reti@@ re .
now i was growing up in the late &apos; 60s and early &apos; 7@@ 0s , and there were a number of other pas@@ sions i was also interested in , but these two were the ones that differ@@ enti@@ ated me .
the pur@@ suit of engagement is also very strong .
so i would like to show you something i &apos;ve been working on .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
so he wrote a program to take the data , extra@@ ct it from wikipedia , and put it into a blo@@ b of lin@@ ked data on the web , which he called d@@ b@@ pedia .
om@@ c : i used to smell like you .
it &apos;s a project that now re@@ a@@ ches across three continents , and its roots go into the fiel@@ ds of mathematics , mar@@ ine biology , femin@@ ine han@@ di@@ craft and environmental ac@@ tivi@@ sm .
anybody in here has actually ever condu@@ cted a s@@ ab@@ ba@@ tical ?
now remember -- why does this happen ?
and who am i kid@@ ding when i say almost ?
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bi@@ c system , so i &apos;m going to show you the lim@@ bi@@ c system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
there had to have been 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 w@@ ells fra@@ cked in o@@ kla@@ hom@@ a , texas , kan@@ s@@ as in that a@@ qui@@ fer .
now , how many things are these ?
and they soon adop@@ ted rules which slo@@ wed down innovation and cut china off from the rest of the world .
they take more risks than children or adul@@ ts , and they are particularly pr@@ one to taking risks when they &apos;re with their friends . there &apos;s an important drive to become independent from one &apos;s parents and to im@@ press one &apos;s friends in adol@@ escence .
and so you can start read@@ ing on your i@@ pad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iphone .
we tell our stories , and a person without a story does not exist .
technology is amazing . people are innova@@ tive .
but we are certainly constru@@ c@@ tioni@@ sts .
it &apos;s a de@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary force , if not hand@@ led right .
but i &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i &apos;m also sure that technology will ad@@ v@@ ance , and therefore living standards will ad@@ v@@ ance .
and he was thinking , &quot; with all the electricity that &apos;s out there in the walls , why couldn &apos;t some of that just come into the phone so i could get some sle@@ ep ? &quot;
that would be the kind of thing that i would do , and it &apos;s not necessarily better than the be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven .
d@@ r : she off@@ ers water , and off go the two wor@@ ms over to the kit@@ chen to get water .
&quot; the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds will be elimin@@ ated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape . &quot;
so i run home , i call my mother , i call my sister , and as i do , at the end of each one of these terrible , terrible dat@@ es , i reg@@ ale them with the details .
these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching cent@@ ers . these pictures are from la vil@@ lette in fr@@ ance and the wel@@ come wing of the science museum in london .
and although less than 25 percent of south bronx resi@@ dents own cars , these projects include thousands of new parking spaces , yet zi@@ p in terms of mass public transi@@ t .
it &apos;s rain . africa is ferti@@ le . they can grow the cro@@ ps .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future .
now this is an interesting chart , and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary process@@ es -- acceler@@ ate .
what have we learned from studying genom@@ es of present day humans and extin@@ ct humans ?
because the aid and oil or min@@ er@@ al money acts the same way .
fellow abi@@ ga@@ il wash@@ burn wanted to be a law@@ yer impro@@ ving us-@@ china rela@@ tions -- until she picked up a ban@@ jo . she tells a moving story of the remarkable connections she &apos;s formed t@@ our@@ ing across the united states and china while playing that ban@@ jo and singing in chinese .
and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today .
it &apos;s a little quir@@ ky and sil@@ ly .
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into span@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most explo@@ i@@ ted , ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing country out there .
i &apos;m doing this because of an old la@@ dy in my village now , who have lost her children .
i took this photo two weeks ago in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , and i realized that 10 years ago , there was nothing like this , of these buildings .
this guy went up , went su@@ person@@ ic , ri@@ pped the f@@ in can off -- y@@ ard s@@ ale in the sky -- and a burning me@@ tal hun@@ k coming back .
so , i was just asked to go and shoot this film called &quot; eli@@ zab@@ eth . &quot;
and i said to her , &quot; you know , i want to give a computer to everybody , every child .
because i knew what a great husband he was , and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me , like he did when i was a little kid . and then a few years later , i had a child , my first child , and again , my father comes to the hospital , and we &apos;re looking at the glass , and see all the children on the other side , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to remind you again , that for each generation to do better , you &apos;re going to have to be a better father than i was . &quot;
mu@@ z@@ et@@ ta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z : using biology to re@@ think the energy challenge
so that &apos;s what the mi@@ dden workers do .
but all this exci@@ tement led to the press writing about us .
an area that was ed@@ g@@ y-@@ ar@@ ts@@ y is now starting to become much cool@@ er and engage a lot more people .
&#91; &quot; who is responsible for e@@ quality ? &quot; &#93; i &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; we are all responsible for e@@ quality . &quot;
and in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment u@@ tter@@ ly le@@ thal for anything that can &apos;t swim away .
therefore , we must invest in developing leaders , leaders that have the skills , vision and determin@@ ation to make peace .
one out of four south bronx children has asth@@ ma .
and , &quot; he noticed a large sta@@ in in the center of the ru@@ g . &quot;
and the avi@@ an flu is also not a good idea .
pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical production is already under way in major laborat@@ ories using microbes .
and before the discovery of these v@@ ents , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and photo@@ synthe@@ sis .
because what that question as@@ su@@ mes is that our ex@@ tern@@ al world is predi@@ ctive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if i know everything about your ex@@ tern@@ al world , i can only predi@@ ct 10 percent of your long-@@ term happiness .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pi@@ rou@@ et@@ ting through the ice r@@ ings of satur@@ n .
thank you .
that &apos;s the beauty of rand@@ omi@@ zation .
it was built by this man who is wa@@ y@@ ne mc@@ cul@@ l@@ ough .
we &apos;ve had economic analysis poin@@ ting out that , not only can we afford it , it &apos;s cheaper to act early .
the world was changing .
my journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
there &apos;s the nest ent@@ ran@@ ce , there &apos;s a pen@@ cil for scale .
i know that in 198@@ 9 he no longer ru@@ led the so@@ vi@@ et union , but that &apos;s the best picture that i can find .
they just le@@ ased them -- because they couldn &apos;t afford to own the fan@@ cy cars .
in sur@@ ve@@ ys of european and american execu@@ tives , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issues or concern@@ s at work that they were afraid to raise .
i kept finding myself at her page .
im : ex@@ cu@@ se me , i didn &apos;t know . all right ?
by having this amazing content be available , we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted , whether it &apos;s just to exp@@ and our minds or it &apos;s to change our lives .
and when i started my blo@@ g it was really this one goal -- i said , i am not going to be famous to the world , but i could be famous to people on the internet .
if you &apos;re using google chro@@ me and you go to a chinese language site , you notice this really c@@ ute box at the top , which automatically dete@@ cts that the page is in chinese and very quickly at a mouse cli@@ ck will give you a trans@@ lation of the page .
we have work to do . and we can mobili@@ ze resources and political will . but the political will has to be mobili@@ zed , in order to mobili@@ ze the resources .
and basically everything we know about per@@ c@@ ussion , which you can think of as an ultras@@ ound of its day -- organ en@@ lar@@ gement , fluid around the heart , fluid in the lungs , ab@@ dom@@ in@@ al changes -- all of this he descri@@ bed in this wonderful man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt &quot; invent@@ um nov@@ um , &quot; &quot; new inven@@ tion , &quot; which would have disappe@@ ared into ob@@ sc@@ uri@@ ty , except for the fact that this physician , cor@@ vi@@ s@@ art , a famous french physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentle@@ man -- cor@@ vi@@ s@@ art re@@ po@@ pul@@ ari@@ zed and rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ced the work .
actually this is not a cur@@ tain . these are vin@@ y@@ l blin@@ ds that are integr@@ ated into the windows themselves , again with fail@@ safe mechan@@ isms that can be li@@ fted such that you can completely de@@ my@@ sti@@ fy , if you chose , the oper@@ ations of the theater going on behind , re@@ hear@@ s@@ als and so forth .
africa &apos;s markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of ro@@ ads and tele@@ communi@@ cations , but also because of the virtual ab@@ sen@@ ce of necessary market institutions , such as market information , gra@@ des and standards , and reli@@ able ways to connect bu@@ yers and s@@ ell@@ ers .
you see here the work of ben fr@@ y . this is &quot; human v@@ s. ch@@ im@@ ps &quot; -- the few chromosom@@ es that di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish us from ch@@ im@@ ps .
so i changed my immedi@@ ate goal to 10,000 faces .
okay , they lay their eg@@ gs where the seas@@ on@@ al ra@@ ins are , the mon@@ soon ra@@ ins .
for me , it &apos;s kind of a feeling about the fle@@ et@@ ing@@ ness of the present moment , and i wanted to ex@@ press that .
gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .
he won the gold me@@ d@@ al in mos@@ cow in the 4,000 meter pur@@ suit .
i think the word is the holi@@ stic experience revol@@ ving around a product .
i thought you were going to throw me out of the family . &quot;
we had been visited in the night by flying squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s , who don &apos;t seem to recogni@@ ze humans for what they are because they &apos;ve never seen them in the canopy before .
and that &apos;s led to this discussion that &apos;s completely ra@@ w , completely un@@ fil@@ tered .
his name is mi@@ ke , and he is uni@@ form@@ ly im@@ pa@@ i@@ red on cogni@@ tion , vision , walking , sen@@ sation .
of course , female do@@ gs , bi@@ t@@ ches , on the other hand , have several bi@@ tch am@@ end@@ ments to male hierarchi@@ cal rule .
well i &apos;ll argu@@ e a non-@@ intelligent brain , we got hold of an old brain , and we &apos;re going to say it &apos;s like a non-@@ mam@@ mal , like a re@@ pti@@ le , so i &apos;ll say , an alli@@ g@@ ator ; we have an alli@@ g@@ ator .
it &apos;s like mush@@ rooms coming through con@@ cre@@ te .
he had written , &quot; va@@ gue , but exciting , &quot; in pen@@ cil , in the corner .
and i sli@@ ced the little spl@@ inter@@ s of wood with a broken sh@@ ard of glass , constru@@ cted this little apartment .
so , i was trying to basically make meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments .
and in that image there , you see a variety of islands of what i call ima@@ ge-@@ making regions in the brain .
and therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
isn &apos;t it ironi@@ c that chri@@ sti@@ ans who cla@@ im to believe in an infinite , un@@ know@@ able being then tie god down in clo@@ sed systems and ri@@ gi@@ d do@@ c@@ tr@@ ines ?
and l@@ o and beh@@ old , 2@@ 50,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak .
so you &apos;re looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach .
it &apos;s the same thing .
but my subject is national security .
i &apos;m always thinking , &quot; how could i be more successful ? &quot;
and i mean books everywhere around the house .
the evidence is very clear that plants pro@@ mote health .
first we do a kind of parti@@ al box and box separ@@ ation , to take away the di@@ stra@@ ction of the sub@@ way noise .
putting them there made them more recogni@@ z@@ able .
so we &apos;re kee@@ ping , like , a million ball@@ s in the air but , what &apos;s going on ?
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell cre@@ ek project .
the great poet e@@ mi@@ ly di@@ ck@@ in@@ son once said , &quot; there is no fri@@ gate like a book to take us lands away . &quot;
so they &apos;re all well docum@@ ented devi@@ ations from ra@@ tional behavior .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
we already know where that passion is going .
and they &apos;re not all bad .
this is the op@@ era house that wa@@ g@@ ner built for himself .
he makes an addi@@ tional indi@@ ct@@ ment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these strong ties in our lives , actually have a hom@@ o@@ geni@@ zing effect on us .
and , i get a lot of fla@@ k for this at cam@@ bridge .
if we re@@ move this mam@@ mal from our ecosystems , they simply will not work .
and then you can just walk behind them and try them on .
and it fun@@ ds a lot of my research .
and if you lose where you are in your biosphere , or are perhaps having a difficul@@ ty conne@@ cting with where you are in the biosphere , i would say to you , take a deep bre@@ ath .
simi@@ lar@@ ly today in the west you &apos;re seeing the problem of enti@@ tle@@ ment -- the cost of social security , the cost of medi@@ care , the cost of medi@@ ca@@ id .
it &apos;s like the earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
now how did we get here ?
connect@@ om@@ es will mark a turning point in human history .
these aren &apos;t just people being jer@@ ks . these are people that are saying , look , i don &apos;t want to talk to you now , or i didn &apos;t want to talk to you then , but i still care about you .
take this repres@@ ent@@ ation of all of the land .
i should add a tragic post@@ script to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident .
they can go into your skin and create skin infe@@ ctions .
i &apos;ve only told you a very small number of things there are data in every aspe@@ ct of our lives , every aspe@@ ct of work and pleasure , and it &apos;s not just about the number of places where data comes , it &apos;s about conne@@ cting it together .
so let &apos;s start off looking at something rather not@@ -@@ so-@@ small , something that we can see with our na@@ ked eye , and that &apos;s a bee . so when you look at this bee , it &apos;s about this size here , it &apos;s about a centi@@ meter .
we call them ba@@ star@@ ds .
in fact , the first time , derek , you played that with an orchestra , you &apos;d learned the version that you &apos;d learned , and then the orchestra , in fact , did have a different version , so while we were waiting in the two hours before the re@@ hear@@ sal and the conc@@ ert , derek listen@@ ed to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra .
but they &apos;re about to create what they call a green list , and the green list will have species that are doing fine , thank you , species that were en@@ danger@@ ed , like the bald e@@ ag@@ le , but they &apos;re much better off now , thanks to everybody &apos;s good work , and prote@@ cted areas around the world that are very , very well managed .
scaling : conven@@ tional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many .
i &apos;m a mathemati@@ cian . we would like to be able to understand better .
even when they &apos;re thinking about something they would describe as pleas@@ ant , they &apos;re actually just slightly less happy than when they aren &apos;t min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing .
one thing that &apos;s interesting : if you look at fron@@ tal@@ -@@ impact cr@@ ash@@ es -- when the car cr@@ ash@@ es , the front hi@@ ts into something -- indeed , what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daugh@@ ters &apos; mou@@ ths .
but what i &apos;m really ple@@ ased to say is , in 2010 , movember became a truly global movement .
when the wil@@ d@@ fir@@ es bro@@ ke out in san die@@ go , in oc@@ tober of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighb@@ ors about what was happening around them .
but i think these are my sort of information high@@ ways : i live in much more of an analo@@ g world , where pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an traffic and inter@@ action and diversity exchange , and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us .
the lesson from that was that it was africa -- an african story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the ben@@ ch@@ mark can be for corpo@@ rate tur@@ nar@@ o@@ unds .
give us a museum of dinosau@@ rs , and we will attra@@ ct touri@@ sts , which is our number two industry .
you just put up , just as one of your numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
i &apos;m pas@@ sing some co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ches around . take a look at their feet .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
but the days of cheap oil are over .
and so now we &apos;re playing back and forth .
it is a us@@ er-@@ appropriate technology that has been used for human@@ it@@ arian good to great effect .
there &apos;s a beautiful stat@@ ement on the screen that says , &quot; light creates ambi@@ ance , and light is also the expression of structure . &quot;
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to establi@@ sh nor@@ ms , a@@ ver@@ ages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;
it &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
my title : &quot; que@@ erer than we can suppose : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &quot;
because my cr@@ ying somehow ex@@ posed his bru@@ t@@ ality to him .
and british motor was around 1@@ 1,000 .
now , i was 16 . i was very worried about what my pe@@ ers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hi@@ ll .
so take a look at that animal .
so when i show the si@@ ms , i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an inter@@ action with the si@@ ms , not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the ta@@ ma@@ got@@ chi .
the bu@@ lk@@ heads have now turned into ho@@ ops of can@@ e , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
a week later , a hand@@ ful of people were there ready to rock and em@@ power the people on the ground who wanted to change the world .
and when media evolve so that the identi@@ ty of the media becomes increasingly unique .
boy : it was about -- interviewer : i mean , that much , or this much ?
by the time i step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely , completely pre@@ vent@@ able problem .
so , mars is a pretty big place even though it &apos;s half the size .
you might have a guess .
and they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say , &quot; sir , yes , sir , &quot; and things like gren@@ ade to@@ ss and weapons care and ma@@ inten@@ ance .
it would have &quot; heart &quot; in that it would have passion and heart and soul .

i s@@ co@@ ot over . i close the door . i leave the phone books .
you can make your own purpose .
here we have 4@@ 9 famous computers . i put them in a lo@@ gari@@ th@@ mic graph .
now , you don &apos;t really think that our airplane system depen@@ ds on the internet , and in some sense it doesn &apos;t .
and we could not find 25 girls in high school .
and if i take a re@@ ed -- if i ru@@ b this , something very amazing happens .
this is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code -- this is what they &apos;re talking about .
now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participa@@ tion in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
they basically are one nation that contro@@ ls most of the equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al wat@@ ers of the central pac@@ i@@ fic ocean .
we no longer need the heat shi@@ eld to protect us from the force of atmosp@@ her@@ ic ent@@ ry , so we je@@ t@@ ti@@ son the heat shi@@ eld , ex@@ pos@@ ing for the first time our lan@@ der to the atmosphere of mars .
this is the instru@@ ctor that ali@@ cia and i chose for the male lead .
well , we used to use tra@@ m@@ pe@@ tt@@ es . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .

businesses of america need to support mr@@ s. obama to do the things that she wants to do .
so , we create sil@@ ence as much as we create sound .
americans themselves are discover@@ ing that un@@ limited choice seems more attra@@ ctive in theory than in practice .
can you stand up ?
development institutions today are also opening for public sc@@ ru@@ tiny the projects they fin@@ ance .
the other ethni@@ c groups , which did have chi@@ ef@@ s , made sure that they surro@@ unded the chi@@ ef@@ s with coun@@ c@@ ils upon coun@@ c@@ ils upon coun@@ c@@ ils to prevent them from ab@@ using their power .
do you have a pre@@ ference ? good choice .
and this idea of p@@ aus@@ ing may be the single biggest lesson i took from my journey .
it was a very tragic time . it was a very difficult time .
but this one died at the age of 16 .
super@@ markets didn &apos;t even want to talk to me about how much food they were wa@@ sting .
they belon@@ ged to boys .
because , of course , the bee thinks he &apos;s in charge or she &apos;s in charge , but we know better .
we didn &apos;t see a single shark .
so now , the thing is that this is a different kind of sp@@ ell .
and others , also connected to the internet , used it as an instrument of democracy .
the small far@@ mer in africa today lives a life without much choice , and therefore without much freedom .
re@@ my@@ a jo@@ se has developed ...
if you go into that phone , every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics . it &apos;s all numbers at the bottom .
and mark t@@ wa@@ in , who knew all about ty@@ p@@ es@@ et@@ ting , really was s@@ mitten by this machine .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
and i think that &apos;s tremend@@ ously important .
du@@ de , you go to ri@@ ker &apos;s island aca@@ de@@ my .
and obviously , it land@@ ed in one of these fl@@ at , dark regions and it didn &apos;t sin@@ k out of sight . so it wasn &apos;t fluid that we land@@ ed in .
add on pan@@ demi@@ c threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
on the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been visited by ali@@ ens .
so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
so that means that we can have some form of self-@@ repli@@ cation .
and that change , that great historic moment , was made possible by cy@@ rus , the king of per@@ sia , reported for us in he@@ bre@@ w in scri@@ p@@ ture and in bab@@ yl@@ oni@@ an in clay .
it also has to be designed to be very aff@@ ord@@ able .
and ma@@ hm@@ oud put on his pro@@ sth@@ es@@ es , the other patients did the same , and they started practi@@ cing for the last time before being di@@ sch@@ ar@@ ged .
my students produced these in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphi@@ cs as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year respon@@ ding to the oil sp@@ ill .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion people have .
but i didn &apos;t have to cut any of them really , because i just lin@@ ed up their ja@@ ws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 te@@ eth and the next small@@ est one had 13 and the next small@@ est had 14 .
these are cellu@@ lar mobile phones .
because of the internet , the truth pre@@ vail@@ ed and everyone knew the truth .
so we cannot er@@ adi@@ cate poverty just yet , but we can get started .
or someone standing in front of a t@@ ank . or being in a position like lance arm@@ strong , and someone says to you , &quot; you &apos;ve got te@@ sti@@ cular cancer . &quot; that &apos;s pretty tough for any male , especially if you ri@@ de a bike .
this is a scot@@ tish castle where people are playing golf in@@ do@@ ors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of su@@ its of arm@@ or -- which you can &apos;t see there .
attention is a powerful thing .
so i &apos;m not saying , &quot; be like us , &quot; and &quot; we &apos;re perfect role models , &quot; because we &apos;re not , but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimen@@ sions .
i love that you put it out there .
we &apos;ve learned today that actually redu@@ cing pollu@@ tion and emissions is gener@@ ating profit .
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
we found that after they adop@@ ted it the compli@@ cation rates fell 35 percent .
i am not a lu@@ d@@ di@@ te .
thank you so much .
in a h@@ ous@@ ing project in val@@ en@@ cia , spa@@ in , we &apos;re doing , the different to@@ wers of h@@ ous@@ ing f@@ used together in shared cur@@ ves so you get a single mass , like a kind of mon@@ oli@@ th , but it brea@@ ks down into individual elements .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also redu@@ ces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
and the reason that it &apos;s pro@@ ved very successful is it &apos;s private , it &apos;s anon@@ ym@@ ous , it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s cheap .
would you go to governments and lob@@ by and use the system ? &quot;
we need to deci@@ ph@@ er the script to answer that question .
and dan led the team for the synthe@@ sis of this over one-@@ milli@@ on-@@ base pair chromo@@ some .
and though she had been part of building a liber@@ al party , a political party that was focused on diversity and tol@@ er@@ ance , about three months before the geno@@ cide , she swi@@ tched par@@ ties and jo@@ ined the extrem@@ ist party , hu@@ tu power , and she became the minister of justice under the geno@@ cide regi@@ me and was known for inci@@ ting men to kill faster and stop be@@ having like women .
this is a material you all know is sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , but i like to think of it as to@@ xi@@ c white stuff .
there are pre@@ dat@@ or be@@ et@@ les , that attack other insects and still look pretty c@@ ute to us .
he was talking about strong , smart , hard@@ working entrepreneurs who wo@@ ke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family &apos;s lives better .
in addition to cu@@ ta@@ ways , we also explain physics .
signifi@@ can@@ ce in life doesn &apos;t come from status , because you can always find somebody who &apos;s got more than you .
and so , on the right , you see gas@@ ol@@ ine emissions , the death rates of 2020 .
if local democracy is to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , it is about the active and in@@ formed engagement of every citi@@ zen .
right ? that would explain it , right ?
what in the design that made the difference is the bo@@ ar@@ ding tu@@ bes : the bo@@ ar@@ ding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a sub@@ way .
the other interesting thing for us -- we like sens@@ ors -- is this idea that you could have an on-@@ ra@@ mp for the internet of things .
well of course , you want to take the books and rele@@ ase the full text of these five million books .
there &apos;s even mi@@ rr@@ ors today that can pick up your pul@@ se rate .
and the telephone . the telephone . if your mother calls on the miser@@ able telephone , she calls and says , &quot; h@@ ello , &quot; you not only know who it is , you know what mo@@ od she &apos;s in .
suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state .
be proud that you have them .
thank you very much .

china has signed military agre@@ ements with many countries in the region .
o@@ .@@ k. , so let me remind you , a turing test is where you &apos;ve got a wall , you &apos;re talking to somebody on the other side of the wall , and when you don &apos;t know if that thing is human or animal -- that &apos;s when computers have re@@ ached human intelligence .
but it absolutely is , especially if it &apos;s being used for growth .
now , suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don &apos;t forget the dark matter , ok .
david pi@@ zar@@ r@@ o : so my favorite part of this cli@@ p is that professor da@@ w@@ kin@@ s actually ga@@ g@@ ged .
we use a very highly autom@@ ated process to sort those plasti@@ cs , not only by type , but by grade .
but in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hydro@@ carbon .
and why would they do that ?
but it appeared to me that all these years that i &apos;d been working on explo@@ i@@ tation -- explo@@ i@@ tation by land@@ lor@@ ds , by mon@@ ey@@ len@@ ders , by tra@@ ders -- gave me an insight that probably i was also an explo@@ i@@ ter , because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income ac@@ cru@@ ed because of the brilli@@ ance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good fai@@ th and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
it initially goes quite slowly .
they &apos;re in@@ expensive , really ru@@ g@@ ged .
we just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what de@@ af@@ ness is about .
cor@@ al is a very beautiful and unusual animal .
i can use it in my company .
until then , cancer was the zo@@ dia@@ c sign of my friend , stage was what i per@@ formed on , and gra@@ des were what i got in school .
you &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
i &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . i &apos;m just a faci@@ li@@ tat@@ or .
in other words , we &apos;re not literally re@@ plac@@ ing the components of the re@@ tin@@ a .
and i had mine on my pocket .
we have this ability to make things , to gras@@ p things with our hands .
this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previ@@ ous world &apos;s altitude record held by the sr@@ -@@ 7@@ 1 bl@@ ack@@ bird .
i &apos;m not quite sure how he died , actually .
when you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
so then , this just needs to have some experience .
invest .
so what i want to talk about today is belief .
and then i re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly mar@@ ia .
thank you very much .
we went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from bo@@ s@@ nia was that elections held too early ens@@ hr@@ ined se@@ ct@@ arian violence , ens@@ hr@@ ined extrem@@ ist par@@ ties , so in iraq in 2003 the decision was made , let &apos;s not have elections for two years . let &apos;s invest in vot@@ er education . let &apos;s invest in democra@@ ti@@ zation .
and when i talk about my ideas , they &apos;re like , &quot; b@@ but it &apos;s not sc@@ al@@ able , you know .
what we need is an international re@@ construction fund -- sebastian m@@ all@@ ab@@ y , washington post , great idea .
now , in their religi@@ o@@ sity , in their nai@@ ve@@ te , my mom and dad , which i believed them to be forever , as they said they were , my mom and dad con@@ cei@@ ved that i had the devi@@ l inside of me .
she dropped them off , and then they would swim away .
in times of fear , for instance , one of the things ser@@ gi@@ o used to say is , fear is a bad ad@@ vi@@ sor .
but , if you look carefully into the cra@@ cks and cre@@ vi@@ ces , you &apos;ll see little things sc@@ ur@@ rying all over the place .
what changed was the balance of the tis@@ su@@ es available .
first of all , afri@@ cans , we need to get better at telling our stories .
and recently , i &apos;ve become interested in di@@ ving much more deeply into a single story .
and i would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard el@@ se@@ where .
another very t@@ all , gri@@ zz@@ led rock star , my friend sir bo@@ b geld@@ of , issu@@ ed a challenge to &quot; feed the world . &quot;

david rock@@ well : a memor@@ i@@ al at ground zero
and i left new york fre@@ ak@@ ed , but actually em@@ power@@ ed .
what might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tui@@ tion has been increasing at almost twice the rate , for a total of 5@@ 5@@ 9 percent since 198@@ 5 .
silent . we don &apos;t have a track for it yet .
then , again , we &apos;re doing the head@@ quar@@ ters for no@@ a@@ a -- national oce@@ ano@@ graphic and atmosp@@ her@@ ic agency -- outside of washington in mar@@ y@@ land .
this gri@@ d is then said to represent the picture of the world &apos;s feelings in the last few hours , if you will .
that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light , it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more functions .
sometimes we spread out .
new models that extend long peri@@ ods of time are hard .
i wanted to get back where the ro@@ mance was .
there &apos;s no gri@@ d , there &apos;s no system , there &apos;s nothing set up in ad@@ v@@ ance .
and so the ment@@ or mother went along with .
but how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future , even if you don &apos;t make those invest@@ ments .
and that was my entire month &apos;s r@@ ent .
i mean , after all , if you look at babies super@@ fi@@ cially , they seem pretty u@@ sel@@ ess .
you really have to be journali@@ sts , you have to be invent@@ ors , you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything .
what i &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the quali@@ ties that i need .
there &apos;s a deep resi@@ stance because using these tools forces us to con@@ front that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to be@@ have with a different set of values .
you have to re@@ frame it and ask , &quot; what is responsible ? &quot;
and that is to focus on a few critical obje@@ cti@@ ves .
i did not start to make social comm@@ entary about my country .
at ide@@ o we have brain@@ stor@@ ming rules written on the walls .
so that &apos;s a ch@@ unk of what we &apos;re looking for .
and the team is exper@@ t , and the team is coura@@ geous , and bri@@ mming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedi@@ tion on the planet .
i stopp@@ ed listening to their stories quite as closely as i had before .
so many of you will be familiar with the idea that there &apos;s this gene called fo@@ x@@ p@@ 2 that seems to be impli@@ cated in some ways in the fine motor control that &apos;s associated with language .
so i wanted to create a new piece that actually for@@ ced people to come and interact with something , and the way i did this was actually by proje@@ cting a 19@@ 50s hou@@ se@@ wife into a bl@@ ender .
and this is an experiment that may test for them in our life@@ time .
i know many well-@@ inten@@ tioned non-@@ musli@@ ms who &apos;ve be@@ gun read@@ ing the koran , but given up , dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ted by its &quot; oth@@ ern@@ ess . &quot;

this is what we base our decisions on in global health : little data , old data , no data .
to bor@@ row a p@@ hrase from car@@ rie fi@@ sher , which is in my bi@@ o there ; i &apos;ll just to@@ ss it out again -- &quot; these days even inst@@ ant gra@@ tifi@@ cation takes too long . &quot;
and that &apos;s the area again .
and this is the ter@@ rain it appe@@ ars over , and we know from ge@@ ological studies that these regions are the ol@@ dest regions on mars .
so that &apos;s why he &apos;s taking the other sandwi@@ ch .
i was 26 . i remember sitting there looking down at my sle@@ dge . i had my sk@@ is ready to go , i had a satellite phone , a pump@@ -@@ action sh@@ ot@@ gun in case i was attac@@ ked by a po@@ lar be@@ ar .
it was a graduate student at -- i &apos;m at ru@@ t@@ gers and my two colleagues -- art aron is at sun@@ y st@@ ony bro@@ ok .
all of system d really doesn &apos;t pay ta@@ xes , right ?
one little gene in you has been trying to get through ?
and we &apos;re working on another transformation , and that is for the exi@@ sting hir@@ sh@@ hor@@ n museum that &apos;s si@@ ted on the most rever@@ ed public space in america , the national m@@ all .
nei@@ l bur@@ ges@@ s : how your brain tells you where you are
as op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de-@@ up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inher@@ ently interesting .
you di@@ p in a corner . the fluid goes into the center .
it &apos;s not really , really fl@@ at .
and so then i learned that listening is not only about waiting , but it &apos;s also learning how better to ask questions .
the wire is ready .
our sweet to@@ oth is an evolved and instin@@ ctu@@ al pre@@ ference for high-@@ energy food .
i &apos;d like to apo@@ logi@@ ze , first of all , to all of you because i have no form of power@@ point present@@ ation .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilo@@ grams of out@@ put .
that was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country .
and you can do more than just insects .
and i &apos;ll never forget , up in the ber@@ ing sea , i was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; dead@@ liest catch &quot; guys -- which i also work on -- in the first seas@@ on .
there &apos;s a caf@@ e and there &apos;s a touri@@ st shop .
and actually , can you see li@@ b@@ by ?
this is obviously an incredibly pain@@ ful experience .
she goes on a p@@ ill a day that tar@@ gets a path@@ way , and again , i &apos;m not sure if this path@@ way was in the system , in the cancer , but it tar@@ ge@@ ted a path@@ way , and a month later , po@@ w , that cancer &apos;s gone .
we hate losing stuff , even if it doesn &apos;t mean a lot of risk .
so , in short , yeah , the dro@@ i@@ ds are coming for our jobs .
and as teachers , after you get all the answers , you like to give them the corre@@ ct answer .
this is from the atlantic . even greater dep@@ th .
clou@@ d-@@ based , no training , no con@@ sul@@ tants , no me .
the first thing you do is lock into a ti@@ ght body position -- head down in your ch@@ est , your arms exten@@ ded , put over your reser@@ ve par@@ ach@@ ute .
but ultimately , it was a dis@@ ruption on top of a dis@@ ruption .
and these are some of the cells that might be over@@ active in dis@@ orders such as epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy .
play increases produ@@ ctivity , not de@@ cre@@ ases .
why is it that x is the unknown ?
well , you can play the tra@@ cker for a fo@@ ol , pre@@ ten@@ ding to be at work when you &apos;re really on vac@@ ation .
but it &apos;s slightly different than in the conven@@ tional picture .
voice 2 : you mean we &apos;ll have to live here , together ?
in an emotion@@ ally char@@ ged talk , ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur@@ -@@ w@@ inning activ@@ ist maj@@ or@@ a car@@ ter details her fight for environmental justice in the south bronx -- and shows how min@@ ority neighbor@@ ho@@ ods suff@@ er most from fla@@ wed urban policy .
so , i &apos;m just , like -- they &apos;re all looking at me like &apos; which one of these is not like the other , &apos; you know ?
in fact , &quot; ori@@ gin of species &quot; was written for a general and popular audience , and was wid@@ ely read when it first appeared .
urban absur@@ dis@@ m -- that &apos;s what the new yor@@ ker really calls for .
now , what is game theory about ?
ed@@ ward s@@ no@@ w@@ den started lea@@ king information , top secret classi@@ fied information , from the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cies , and we started learning about things like pri@@ sm and x@@ key@@ score and others .
and if we can main@@ tain the more positive feelings about the past , that becomes the new norm .
another suit , please .
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villa@@ ges and go into cities , is because they are always gravi@@ tat@@ ing towards increased choices and possibilities .
in the green room i received my uniform .
mo@@ und up those four pl@@ ates with vege@@ tables and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of bur@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and celebra@@ te it .
but in order to get this solution working , we have to now change how business sees itself , and this is than@@ k@@ fully under@@ way .
and what does he do ? he li@@ kes to tell you how the de@@ ce@@ ased got de@@ ce@@ ased , the people he &apos;s talking to through his e@@ ar , you see ?
and this also happened to my girls as they began to see , and , we thought , maybe became an o@@ un@@ ce more com@@ passionate .
so , there &apos;s this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go .
we need to take the fact that the current emplo@@ ye@@ es , the future li@@ abilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
he can ru@@ in the most interesting match by just spo@@ u@@ ting c@@ liche again and again and again .
so one of the reasons , if we come back to why did i call it bu@@ zz@@ car ? i wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hi@@ ve , and its incredible faci@@ lity to create this platform that individuals want to participa@@ te and inno@@ v@@ ate on .
when i was 17 years of age , i was born and re@@ ared on a farm in north carolina .
obviously , that &apos;s heavy for am@@ anda .
student : a police car pul@@ ls up in front , and a co@@ p comes to the front door , and kno@@ cks , and says he &apos;s looking for me .
as h@@ ans ros@@ ling , the master , my master , said , &quot; let the dat@@ as@@ et change your min@@ d@@ set . &quot;
then , your other ex@@ cu@@ se is , &quot; yes , there are special people who pur@@ sue their pas@@ sions , but they are geni@@ uses .
maybe because these conven@@ tional no@@ tions of progress haven &apos;t deli@@ ver@@ ed big benefits in terms of happiness , there &apos;s been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself .
and so , to me , i wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
here &apos;s he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r again .
so basically , if there &apos;s two su@@ bs in the same shot , i shot it , because where &apos;s the camera coming from ?
and we have spent a lot of money .
and so that &apos;s how they live .
why the cow was cros@@ sing the road , you know .
i had no idea how perfect a real education i was getting for the music business on this box .
and i thought , &quot; you know , i wonder what my so@@ le@@ us mu@@ sc@@ le is ? &quot;
this br@@ ings me to the third , and perhaps most proble@@ matic , as@@ sumption : &quot; you must never say no to choice . &quot;
you take 10 kilo@@ grams of feed , you can get one kilo@@ gram of be@@ ef , but you can get nine kilo@@ grams of lo@@ cu@@ st meat .
it is with this context that us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di came to be .
this was a small net that was being used in mexi@@ co to catch sh@@ ri@@ mp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
but i think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously across fron@@ ti@@ ers right across the world .
h@@ ello ! my name is gol@@ an le@@ vin .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
now , i said , &quot; move your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot;
it was appro@@ aching 11 when i exi@@ ted right toward af@@ ul@@ a , and passed a large quar@@ ry and was soon in k@@ far kar@@ a .
and so i went out .
mi@@ ko : i don &apos;t think so .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
every act of communication is , in some way , an act of trans@@ lation . on@@ stage at tedx@@ ra@@ ini@@ er , writer chris bli@@ ss thinks hard about the way that great com@@ e@@ dy can translate deep tru@@ ths for a mass audience . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , i &apos;m going to sum up a year &apos;s worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
this has cru@@ cial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
today i want to tell you about such a device .
there are four kinds of strength , or resili@@ ence , that contribu@@ te to post-@@ trau@@ matic growth , and there are scienti@@ fi@@ cally v@@ ali@@ d@@ ated ac@@ tivi@@ ties that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resili@@ ence , and you don &apos;t need a trauma to do it .
and because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : we go into deni@@ al : &quot; it &apos;s not me , it has nothing to do with me , it &apos;s never going to happen to me . &quot;
here , i &apos;ll give you an example .
why do we all follow the line in the street ?
but computers don &apos;t do much else other than speed up the process of comp@@ iling di@@ c@@ tion@@ ari@@ es .
then he practi@@ ces for another year and takes les@@ sons -- now he &apos;s nine .
for@@ ty miles an hour into a fix@@ ed bar@@ rier -- 35 gs .
you have for@@ mul@@ as that long .
they &apos;re actually looking at them down in that world .
the other thing that the early man invented was fire .
and i would like to show you here my ti@@ died up version of this picture .
it &apos;s very bu@@ sy . same principles : one-@@ on-@@ one attention , complete de@@ vo@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a bo@@ und@@ less opti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
why does what &apos;s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?
so as food became more pl@@ enti@@ ful , bread became cheaper .
this is a micro@@ flu@@ i@@ di@@ c chip that i developed .
so clearly there was a problem with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation .
it &apos;s not just innovation , compassion and passion -- compassion in the heart and passion in the bel@@ ly .
we do like to con@@ sume , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
they are sha@@ ping our very desi@@ res .
now , those little bar@@ bs obviously stick to the insects well , but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph , and that is that you might be able to see a fra@@ cture line across what would be the equ@@ ator of this , if it was the earth .

what adam &apos;s been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces , but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument .
it &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
this is a private school .
things in life start out being general cell , and they become speci@@ alized : you have tissue cells , you have mu@@ sc@@ le , brain cells . and same things happens with say , a hammer , which is general at first and becomes more specific .
and you put a drop , in this case , of ur@@ ine at the bottom .

and at the more un@@ equal end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important -- in the u.k. , usa .
so -- so this was my nature . the thing was , i saw that the rou@@ te that i took to discover@@ ing this focus in my work and who i was , i saw it as just this road to discovery .
they &apos;re watching their own brain ac@@ ti@@ vation , and they &apos;re controlling the path@@ way that produ@@ ces their pain .

i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth .
they travel at exactly the same time with the same win@@ ds to make the cros@@ sing . i know they travel at the same altitude .
so we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
some of my fellow journali@@ sts might interpre@@ t it that way .
and i started looking at how we could build battery back@@ -up systems that could give people five hours , 10 hours , maybe even a full day , or three days &apos; worth of back@@ -up power .
we love to do jo@@ gging , fi@@ t@@ ness .

go back to this image of the a@@ x@@ e and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; who made them and for who ? &quot;

this was a secret intelligence report com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed by the ken@@ y@@ an government after its ele@@ ction in 2004 .

one of the things i want to establi@@ sh right from the start is that not all neuro@@ surge@@ ons wear co@@ w@@ boy bo@@ ots .
here , we have an electri@@ cal model illu@@ str@@ ating a mind having a will , but capable of only two ideas .

and i became increasingly more and more agi@@ t@@ ated , because i was there not only to be with them , but also to ri@@ de and create a team and i didn &apos;t know what to do .

i &apos;m speaking about compassion from an isla@@ mic point of view , and perhaps my fai@@ th is not very well thought of as being one that is gro@@ unded in compassion .

so the sign@@ al-@@ to-@@ noise ra@@ ti@@ o then pres@@ ents us with a patter@@ n@@ -@@ dete@@ ction problem .
and then i think the other point is that indi@@ ans today are far more com@@ fort@@ able with globali@@ zation .

after 10 years in le@@ ban@@ on , from national marath@@ ons or from national events to smaller regional ra@@ ces , we &apos;ve seen that people want to run for a better future .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , bu@@ t@@ cher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high-@@ quality scan@@ ning .

now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious .
but then we hit the 20th century and we ent@@ ered a new culture that histori@@ ans call the culture of person@@ ality .
we go into the cold war , and we continue to try and build walls .
it &apos;s the rand@@ om@@ ness , the disorder , the cha@@ o@@ ti@@ c@@ ness of some systems .
because the theory predi@@ cts that the big bang would have been so inten@@ se that as space rapidly exp@@ and@@ ed , tiny qu@@ ant@@ um j@@ it@@ ters from the mi@@ cr@@ o world would have been stre@@ tched out to the ma@@ cr@@ o world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a di@@ stin@@ ctive finger@@ print , a pattern of slightly hot@@ ter spots and slightly col@@ der spots , across space , which powerful telescop@@ es have now obser@@ ved .

now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .
so could art change the world ?

even the parts of the airplane had french names .
and i thought a hot@@ dog will be more symbo@@ lic .
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very dou@@ b@@ t@@ ful .
people that are put in a condi@@ tion of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is alle@@ ge@@ dly patter@@ n@@ less .
and i use this little image to say this is what happens to mos@@ ses .
it &apos;s finan@@ ce@@ able in the private capital market .

how about that ?
what were these arti@@ facts for ?
and he plan@@ ted it in a ro@@ y@@ al po@@ ta@@ to pat@@ ch , with gu@@ ards who had instru@@ ctions to gu@@ ard over it , night and day , but with secret instru@@ ctions not to gu@@ ard it very well .
this is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused , creative , spon@@ tane@@ ous , and to perform at our very best in everything that we do .
was what any self-@@ respe@@ cting researchers would have done .
why would i need a b@@ loo@@ dy water fe@@ ature ? &quot;
not only has that been weak@@ . it &apos;s getting weak@@ er .
to put it very simply , the as@@ sumption so far has been that if you give people enough conne@@ ctivity , if you give them enough devi@@ ces , democracy will ine@@ vit@@ ably follow .
now that &apos;s a left vent@@ ri@@ cle pushing blood up through the aor@@ tic valve -- you can see two of the le@@ af@@ lets of the aor@@ tic valve working there -- up into the as@@ cen@@ ding aor@@ ta .
so , i was able to completely da@@ y@@ dream my way through my life .
the first insight is that while the conscious mind wri@@ tes the auto@@ bio@@ graphy of our species , the un@@ conscious mind does most of the work .
this is our task ; we know it will be hard .
no@@ ah fel@@ d@@ man : politics and religion are technologies
and it was time for us to put oxygen in .
that &apos;s all the time i have , so thank you very much for your attention .
now 199@@ 5 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
we can also use cy@@ mati@@ cs as a beautiful natural art form .
it turned out that giving the plan@@ es to the museum was worth much more than the de@@ bt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income tax .
and then it wir@@ es itself to the current colle@@ ctor .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
which means that , while we all have one bio@@ graphy , they have many .
if your leg is ch@@ opp@@ ed off and you lose blood , your body will cl@@ amp down , increase the heart rate , do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up .
throw a drug at it , and resi@@ stant cells will grow back .
4@@ 8 percent of working tri@@ bes say , these are emplo@@ yed tri@@ bes , say , &quot; i &apos;m great and you &apos;re not . &quot;
now what does that mean ?
so i thought i &apos;d start by telling you how i got here .
it &apos;s the gui@@ dance she gets around inf@@ ant feeding and sa@@ fer sex .
why has television enter@@ tain@@ ment evolved the way it has ?
so what you can do is you can multi@@ p@@ ly those data by the no that &apos;s released and you can calcu@@ late how much ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de would be released from the skin into the circu@@ lation .
you can see it even better from down on top .
but guess what happened . the moment you add ro@@ me without coffee , ro@@ me with coffee becomes more popular . and people choose it .
we &apos;ve been able to see every single ner@@ ve .
and people came up and picked up the cultur@@ ally reson@@ ant image of the fal@@ af@@ el , ate it and , you know , talked and left .
we can question : is it a good thing that all of us continu@@ ously self-@@ optimi@@ ze ourselves to fit better into that society ?
ho@@ ward is not so easily plac@@ ated .
they looked at their local population .
i &apos;ve been involved with the u.s. de@@ fen@@ se department bio@@ shi@@ eld program .
is it that i write very well ?
there &apos;s a bunch of other industri@@ es that don &apos;t have copyright prote@@ ction , including the food industry .
now , you must have all taken a band@@ -@@ aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what &apos;s the right approach .
my talk today is about what the mes@@ sa@@ ges are if you do want to stay in the work@@ force , and i think there are three .
it &apos;s two and a half in@@ ches thi@@ ck , and suppor@@ ted at two points .
you know , a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of hero@@ ism , which is kind of cool , but j@@ ill has what i call slow hero@@ ism .
if it wasn &apos;t able to stre@@ tch so much , then basically when an insect hit the web , it would just tra@@ m@@ po@@ line right off of it .
it &apos;s this techni@@ que of building the properties into the form .
with parkinson &apos;s disease , and this la@@ dy has parkinson &apos;s disease , and she has these electro@@ des in her brain , and i &apos;m going to show you what she &apos;s like when the electro@@ des are turned off and she has her parkinson &apos;s symptoms , and then we &apos;re going to turn it on .
e@@ j : finally , let &apos;s see what this looks like .
so one of the problems with the filter bu@@ bble was discovered by some researchers at net@@ fli@@ x .
but tamiflu -- the virus is resi@@ stant . it is resi@@ stant to tamiflu .
that profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they &apos;re trying to solve .
which isn &apos;t a great idea .
why ?
so , please mix them .
well , the north@@ west pas@@ sage is already there .
but when he made that speech , what could you do to build the stronger , better society ?
the people who create these games are smart .
i &apos;m really le@@ an@@ ing into me , because i , because i have to think about what decisions i &apos;m going to make on the fly as that be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven text is running in time through my head and i &apos;m trying to figure out what kinds of trans@@ forma@@ tions so this is an engaging enter@@ prise for me , and i &apos;ve really le@@ an@@ ed into that first person pr@@ on@@ ou@@ n thing there , and now my face appe@@ ars twice , so i think we can agree that this is a fundam@@ entally soli@@ p@@ si@@ stic enter@@ prise .
it was a really very stres@@ s@@ ful time .
i developed a really simple sc@@ oring system for s@@ laugh@@ ter plants where you just measure out@@ comes : how many cat@@ tle fell down ?
and as soon as i started this work , i received a memor@@ and@@ um from the world bank , from the legal department first , in which they said , &quot; you are not allowed to do this .
and how i set about that , i got some spl@@ inter@@ s of wood .
this is the ice starting to free@@ ze over . the s@@ now f@@ ence they built .
and they can feed that information back to their sub@@ scri@@ bers , but only to their sub@@ scri@@ bers on the same high@@ way lo@@ cated behind the traffic ja@@ m !
this is something that we &apos;re using today to search for e@@ .t. , and the electronics have gotten very much better too .
we &apos;d like to pick you up .
199@@ 6 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 2006 : over five million .
in europe alone , by 20@@ 50 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 17@@ 0 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
what they &apos;re doing in the red@@ wood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean , or how they got there , is completely unknown .
and then this thing here -- i &apos;m hoping as you drive by you &apos;ll hear the pi@@ cket f@@ ence effect of the sound hi@@ tting it .
finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year .
the third way in which sound affe@@ cts you is cogni@@ tively .
and that line there is a predi@@ ction from the same theory , based on the same principles , that descri@@ bes that forest .
and we can now start to comp@@ are the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences .
so it &apos;s what we call fre@@ el@@ o@@ ading .
it &apos;s a non-@@ spi@@ king cell .
and it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it .
then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ stic hit -- that i felt good about myself .
the institutions of the past with all their in@@ er@@ ti@@ a are just ir@@ relevant for the future , except they &apos;re there and we have to deal with them . i spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world , the other 85 percent , the usual -- and whatever else we de@@ vote ourselves to .
it &apos;s a moment that you can &apos;t make sense of .
thanks very much .
and in about 199@@ 7 , the th@@ en-@@ director phili@@ ppe de mon@@ te@@ b@@ ello gave me the go@@ -@@ ahead to organi@@ ze an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion for 2002 . we normally have these very long le@@ ad@@ -@@ in times .
this chair -- they sold a billion dollars &apos; worth of a@@ er@@ on cha@@ irs by rein@@ venting what it meant to sell a chair .
so there he is there .
it &apos;s a full-@@ figure cast from myself .
the neocortex is responsible for all of our ra@@ tional and analy@@ tical thought and language .
marketing is s@@ elling an ad to a fir@@ m .
but this is that attempt .
now i want to take you into the cal@@ der@@ a .
it is this mer@@ ging of our self with di@@ v@@ ini@@ ty that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our fai@@ th tradi@@ tions .
so i guess it &apos;s a world premi@@ er .
and now i really want to build one . &quot;
so now suppose we test them all .
there &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dra@@ gon@@ fish .
and we know , and especially car@@ ol@@ y@@ n knows , that when the sun will imp@@ lo@@ de , the earth will burn , explo@@ de , i don &apos;t know what , and this is sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for four , four billion years ?
now , p@@ vc is a little bit better , but still not as good as the wood that we chose .
but i wanted to show you a fish because -- in fact , it &apos;s very different from a fish .
and we actually know where brain came from .
so we go . we look at the to@@ ol@@ ing . we look at how that is produced .
we &apos;re just built differently .
from the e@@ g conference : produ@@ ctivity gur@@ u tim fer@@ ri@@ ss &apos; fun , encoura@@ ging an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es show how one simple question -- &quot; what &apos;s the worst that could happen ? &quot; -- is all you need to learn to do anything .
you &apos;ll see these different kinds of minds .
i mean , i showed my three-@@ year-old this slide last night , and he &apos;s like , &quot; papa , why is an am@@ bu@@ lance in these people &apos;s homes ? &quot;
and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago .
let &apos;s have people hold up sig@@ ns about re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . &quot;
we &apos;ve got to think about all these different kinds of minds , and we &apos;ve got to absolutely work with these kind of minds , because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future .
here &apos;s a building for the gap , where the ancient gras@@ ses of san br@@ un@@ o , california , are on the roof .
if you &apos;d gone into the minds of the people , well , you would have seen a lot of trauma , and you would have seen a lot of hear@@ ta@@ che , and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to re@@ cover .
society w@@ ins : fewer cri@@ mes , fewer victims .
so just looking at this heart , i can play back a video here .
does that ever happen to us ?
i &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
and &quot; beat@@ ja@@ zz@@ ers &quot; become as common as d@@ .@@ j@@ . &apos; s .
choice . now you all shop online , comp@@ are online , do everything online , and yet this revolution has har@@ dly tou@@ ched the surface of public services like education , or health care or poli@@ cing , and you &apos;re going to see this change mas@@ si@@ vely .
and there is the idea that , when we look at things , it is the yellow light that helps us the most , that we are the most sensi@@ tive for .
well , of course , there is globali@@ zation , technology , communi@@ cations , all that stuff , which we &apos;ll talk about a little bit later .
for ge@@ olo@@ cation , accu@@ ra@@ cy matters , and things have only improved over the last 10 years .
and then i go out , and they work on me for the rest of the night , and i needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there while they did their work , and the surgeon took out about a third of my inte@@ stin@@ es , my ce@@ c@@ um , organs i didn &apos;t know that i had , and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to re@@ move my app@@ en@@ di@@ x for me , which i thought was great , you know , just a little ti@@ dy thing there at the end .
if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine of flying .
so that &apos;s the place where you really want to co@@ ok .
and fri@@ day night we &apos;re trying to decide between risk@@ y sex or happiness . &quot;
google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people as@@ sume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine .
so this will be the typical work@@ flow situation .
the data from this is global news co@@ verage from thousands of news sources around the world .
but this shows you that the government of uganda is not com@@ mitted to spending its own revenue to invest in produ@@ ctive invest@@ ments , but rather it de@@ vot@@ es this revenue to pa@@ ying structure of public expen@@ di@@ ture .
copyright law &apos;s gri@@ p on film , music and software bar@@ ely tou@@ ches the fashion industry ... and fashion benefits in both innovation and sales , says jo@@ han@@ na bla@@ k@@ ley . in her talk , she talks about what all creative industri@@ es can learn from fashion &apos;s free culture . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i could accept that .
he was incredibly com@@ passionate in some of his relationships and terri@@ bly in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate in others .
it com@@ promi@@ ses the life and the health of some of our most under@@ pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged and vulnerable people , the ab@@ original communities that have so much to teach us .
i &apos;m still in a vulnerable position .
chris , could you stand up and let them see you -- a young , vi@@ sion@@ ary film@@ ma@@ ker who &apos;s made a film .
na@@ to forces went in , and the ser@@ bi@@ an army with@@ dre@@ w .
but when did a bee actually ever give you an in@@ voice ?
it was at that moment , in that very small town of 3@@ 0,000 or so , that i truly appreci@@ ated the va@@ st@@ ness of the universe and the sear@@ ching we might do in it .
i tried to tell them to go away .
and that was true until i got to college .
so essentially , you &apos;re able to achieve quite high rates of con@@ dom use in commercial sex .
it &apos;s a com@@ po@@ und curve inter@@ ior .
there is going to be a big shift towards pre@@ vent@@ ative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk fac@@ tors that we have as individuals .
should have done this before i tried to pi@@ tch it .
people who sell us fossi@@ l fu@@ els .
where you den@@ y the other person &apos;s reality , you have para@@ do@@ x where you allow more than one reality to co@@ exist , i think there &apos;s another philosophi@@ cal construction .
there aren &apos;t electri@@ c fiel@@ ds here . it &apos;s a magne@@ tic field .
and i think , je@@ ez , i &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !
oh , my god .
the p@@ c virus problem is 25 years old now .
i didn &apos;t do yoga . i &apos;m not ready . &quot;
there &apos;s a histori@@ cal marker .
and this was a dog that put both his o@@ wn@@ ers in hospital , plus the bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , plus the child .
and eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve master@@ y .
they didn &apos;t know all that much about it , but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them .
and it was mad@@ ame b@@ ous@@ son , you know , she was very &#91; french &#93; .
so i showed him this , and this is actual foot@@ age that he was on . this is apoll@@ o 15 . this was his mission .
and he has 2.@@ 2 million re@@ qu@@ ests for reser@@ va@@ tions .
we know that , because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week , surprise , surprise , satur@@ day comes in at first , then fri@@ day , then sun@@ day .
i start it myself .
you have to stand up in the moment to do that .
and i call them horizon@@ tal identi@@ ties , because the pe@@ er group is the horizon@@ tal experience .
it &apos;s not that a co@@ con@@ u@@ t fell on my head , and i came upon this idea .
every g@@ it system gener@@ ates this number the same way , which means this is a signature ti@@ ed directly and un@@ for@@ ge@@ ably to a particular change .
this is all seven har@@ ry po@@ tter no@@ vels , because she did tend to fa@@ ff on a bit near the end .
and that &apos;s communication .
you say , any@@ time you have a v@@ acu@@ um state , you will discover that one whe@@ el will not turn another one , if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the v@@ acu@@ um . that kind of thing .
and from that you have new possibilities for computing .
in fact , in terms of the five senses , chris &apos; clo@@ ck is a revolution .
its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet earth .
and we see a bli@@ p up in the tru@@ ck@@ ers &apos; pur@@ ch@@ ases of fuel , and we know that a re@@ c@@ ession is about to end .
h@@ ans ros@@ ling : hiv -- new facts and stun@@ ning data visu@@ als
the ga@@ y agen@@ da , people !
we lay out the building areas .
the other wonderful thing about you is memory .
n@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that i haven &apos;t seen you .
i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explan@@ ation of the political situation and expla@@ ined how hard and difficult the war will be .
somebody was smart and put a bi@@ c pen in my ne@@ ck to open up my air@@ way so that i could get some air in there .
even in today &apos;s world , their situation would be really di@@ re , but think about how much worse it would have been then .
it has cur@@ ves in two dire@@ ctions , one curve up@@ ward and opposite trans@@ ver@@ se curve down the other , so any kind of per@@ turb@@ ation spre@@ ads the forces over the surface of this type of shape .
i know it doesn &apos;t look like a school , but it is something we decided to do , and it is extremely , extremely green .
something universal is going on .
and i went to car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on , and i ear@@ ned my ph@@ d in robo@@ tics .
another technology that we have used in patients actually invol@@ ves bla@@ d@@ ders .
a few years later , tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee worked that out .
it &apos;s a u@@ ti@@ li@@ t@@ arian article , that &apos;s why .
when pat@@ ri@@ ck hen@@ ry , the gover@@ nor of virginia , said these words in 17@@ 75 , he could never have imag@@ ined just how much they would come to reson@@ ate with american gener@@ ations to come .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
these contin@@ gen@@ t mo@@ tiv@@ ators -- if you do this , then you get that -- work in some cir@@ cum@@ stances .
my favorite one was he was in the man@@ hole .
it &apos;s not about making learning happen .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ eight percent of our fa@@ thers are al@@ co@@ holi@@ cs .
it makes no od@@ ds . in fact , in the north@@ ern he@@ mi@@ sphere , we &apos;re further from the sun in summer , as it happens , but it makes no od@@ ds , the difference .
i think that &apos;s possible , because there is a corner of the death pen@@ al@@ ty de@@ ba@@ te -- maybe the most important corner -- where everybody agre@@ es , where the most ar@@ dent death pen@@ al@@ ty suppor@@ ters and the most vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous abo@@ li@@ tioni@@ sts are on exactly the same page .
do it as long as necessary until you have master@@ y .
it is , i agree , a nice thing to do .
it li@@ stens to the le@@ cture , and then it uses the am@@ pli@@ tude of each word to move a point on the x-@@ axis , and it uses the in@@ fle@@ ction of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-@@ axis .
and by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
thanks to cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , we get as@@ yl@@ um in the u.s .
so let me talk about hydrogen first .
we &apos;re also becoming children of the corn , creating farms in the middle of for@@ d@@ ham road for awareness and window bot@@ tles out of gar@@ bage .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang pu@@ ck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspi@@ ring to work towards ?
ok . now i , like ze frank , can predi@@ ct your next thought , which is , &quot; yeah , right . &quot; because when people synthe@@ size happiness , as these gentle@@ men seem to have done , we all smile at them , but we kind of roll our eyes and say , &quot; yeah right , you never really wanted the job . &quot;
we can detect sound waves in the atmosp@@ heres of sun@@ -like stars .
so making images mean@@ ing@@ ful has three components .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journ@@ al , the quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ view of biology .
un@@ aids tell us that the hiv rate in z@@ am@@ bia is 20 percent , and mortality est@@ im@@ ates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
but the one cloud that best expres@@ ses why clou@@ d@@ spo@@ tting is more valuable today than ever is this one , the cu@@ mul@@ us cloud .
so there &apos;s a do@@ t on here for every galaxy .
it &apos;s an act of un@@ condi@@ tional ac@@ cept@@ ance , something that he never had .
and to keep the many from ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ zing the one , we came up with concepts like individual liber@@ ty .
and then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way .
and then i decided i &apos;d de@@ di@@ cate my life to saving one million people every year .
and we become the subje@@ cts and objects of other people &apos;s lives .
people have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and re@@ tool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
people see each other be@@ having .
we &apos;re working on projects now -- even w@@ ing-@@ fla@@ pping things the size of haw@@ k mo@@ ths -- dar@@ pa contra@@ cts , working with cal@@ tech , u@@ cl@@ a .
what could be bad ? &quot;
one last question : how many of you feel com@@ fort@@ able that as you &apos;re plan@@ ning for reti@@ rement you have a really soli@@ d plan when you &apos;re going to reti@@ re , when you &apos;re going to cla@@ im social security benefits , what lifestyle to expect , how much to spend every month so you &apos;re not going to run out of money ?
imagine having a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are while you &apos;re a@@ wake .
the last step , of course , is appli@@ cation .
and so we re@@ defined this mar@@ gin@@ alized position as the place of architecture .
photograph@@ y off@@ ered the cri@@ minal justice system a tool that transformed inno@@ cent citizens into cri@@ min@@ als , and the cri@@ minal justice system failed to recogni@@ ze the limi@@ tations of rel@@ ying on photo@@ graphic identifi@@ cations .
we can start to figure that out .
well , in a place like sar@@ as@@ ota , florida , the average inter@@ val between times that a bo@@ at is pas@@ sing within a hundred me@@ ters of a dolphin group is six minutes .
to give you a quick pri@@ mer on where we are , a quick re@@ fres@@ her on where we are .
and we studied many models .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here -- high chil@@ d-@@ survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rain@@ bo@@ w of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
it &apos;s a very slow process .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
this here is part of the same lab at the ro@@ y@@ al college of arts .
that &apos;s how we met .
all it takes in one person to mess it up .
two , they allow you to stay under@@ water longer .
and you can start i@@ ter@@ ating the design .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convin@@ cing everybody that child labor just had to be abo@@ li@@ shed .
now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
but literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transpar@@ ency , and now it &apos;s fast becoming the norm and the law .
this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible re@@ al-@@ world sources .
&quot; i already heard your mother . i think she &apos;s right . &quot;
could we , in fact , encoura@@ ge all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their free@@ z@@ ers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succe@@ e@@ ded in terms of being effective for the treat@@ ments they were tried for ?
he helped design some of the air hand@@ ling systems in this building and the way it was venti@@ l@@ ated .
emplo@@ ye@@ es mu@@ tu@@ ally inspi@@ re each other towards greater good .
&#91; @ adam last ni@@ te was a b@@ last ! lo@@ ved d@@ at apple lo@@ l &#93; &#91; @ eve ye@@ p .. bab@@ e , know what happened to my pants th@@ o ? &#93; we do reve@@ al so much more information about ourselves online than ever before , and so much information about us is being colle@@ cted by organizations .
you can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty is being built .
thank you . thank you .
so all these little p@@ das and laptops -- every digital circu@@ it in the world -- started in africa .
and so what does that mean , that it &apos;s bio@@ degra@@ d@@ able and bio@@ com@@ pati@@ ble ?
and at one point , one of the girls who was sitting at his table , seeing what he was doing , le@@ an@@ ed over and said to him , &quot; that &apos;s terrible . that doesn &apos;t look anything like a horse . &quot;
oh , for al g@@ ore to come and be in the real world as president .
in terms of dollars per what &apos;s stor@@ ed , it &apos;s simply the best .
the research that my laborat@@ ory has been doing , that economi@@ sts and psych@@ ologists around the country have been doing , have reve@@ al@@ ed something really quite star@@ t@@ ling to us , something we call the &quot; impact bi@@ as , &quot; which is the ten@@ den@@ cy for the simul@@ ator to work bad@@ ly .
you can pull through , we have pulled through , but it &apos;s dangerous .
what if we put hol@@ ly into the same context as humans ?
no matter , she was just de@@ ligh@@ ted to be in school .
and so sebastian bought sque@@ ak to protect his repu@@ tation .
now , that doesn &apos;t mean that people understand that global warming hur@@ ts the po@@ or@@ est and the weak@@ est the most .
you know , they &apos;ll resi@@ st that compar@@ is@@ on and that &apos;s natural , that &apos;s human .
and it did happen this way .
and that &apos;s too bad , because we &apos;re very good at chari@@ ty .
but fre@@ ely li@@ cen@@ sed tex@@ t@@ books are the next big thing in education .
my belief is that you don &apos;t have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .
so while i was sitting in a t@@ all building in new york , i put those two experiences together side by side , and basically conclu@@ ded that conne@@ ctivity is produ@@ ctivity -- whether it &apos;s in a modern office or an under@@ developed village .
and we pri@@ de ourselves -- it &apos;s a spect@@ acu@@ lar anti-@@ spect@@ ac@@ le in which all the conven@@ tions of spect@@ ac@@ le are turned on their head .
if you put too much cold water in , it will sh@@ at@@ ter .
i haven &apos;t given a talk in nearly four months .
this is a photograph several years later , when bra@@ g@@ g had cause to smile .
as you can see from these pictures , the spac@@ ing between can be used for multiple pur@@ pos@@ es including agri@@ cultural land , range land or open space .
charles whi@@ t@@ man was his name .
what does that mean ?
but recently , any an@@ nu@@ al report of a power company doesn &apos;t have a power station on it .
so i go , &quot; you know , why don &apos;t we go on the internet , and maybe we can see ... like on wikipedia . &quot;
they bor@@ row money .
we hope that we can make computing a user model you &apos;re familiar with , and really der@@ i@@ ve insi@@ ghts from you , from all different dire@@ ctions .
okay so , in my world , what do we need to do ?
and we &apos;ll wind in the target .
i built it .
so definition number six is the north american definition of the word &quot; su@@ ck . &quot;
and it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affe@@ cting our world , but it starts to go up -- because i think we can start corre@@ cting our footprint and bring it down -- but there &apos;s a growing footprint that &apos;s happening in asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so i don &apos;t think we can e@@ quali@@ ze it . so ultimately the strate@@ gy , i think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .
nobody ever will . they &apos;re smaller than the wa@@ vel@@ ength of light .
a word about gal@@ vao , a very r@@ are kind of bird native to brazi@@ l .
and no matter what i say , you cannot unti@@ e me from the ma@@ st .
the electro@@ des are turned off now , and you can see that she has tre@@ m@@ or .
and the calls that -- you know how they say , &quot; your call may be recorded for quality as@@ surance ? &quot;
instead , innovation , if you remember , some of you may have read the famous econ@@ om@@ ist sch@@ um@@ peter , he said , &quot; innovation is no@@ vel@@ ty in how value is created and distribu@@ ted . &quot;
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
i gradu@@ ated from ris@@ d . my grandparents were very proud , and i moved to boston , and i set up shop .
and the mal@@ di@@ ves , and i &apos;m sure some of you have been there -- so here is home .
so , i don &apos;t know what the name of this thing is .
there wasn &apos;t this dialo@@ gue going on that i imag@@ ined was happening .
14@@ th let &apos;s say that you and me like each other .
so you see , they are spread all over the city .
these are com@@ post toi@@ lets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the princi@@ p@@ al .
now if you don &apos;t like these rules , and many of us don &apos;t -- i know i didn &apos;t , and i still don &apos;t , even though i follow them half the time , not quite aware that i &apos;m following them -- what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hum@@ or ?
jun@@ ki@@ es find v@@ eins in their to@@ es when the ones in their arms and their legs collap@@ se . developing tar sands and coal s@@ hal@@ e is the equi@@ valent . here are just a few of the invest@@ ments that i personally think make sense .
and john do@@ er@@ r and bro@@ ok and others got concerned , &#91; unclear &#93; , and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepar@@ ed for a pan@@ demi@@ c . and we saw a lot of ga@@ ps .
i mean , i li@@ ked him a lot better than the sand@@ wor@@ ms .
and finally , another individual s@@ at for me from behind and later res@@ cin@@ ded his participa@@ tion , so i had to pi@@ x@@ el@@ ate him out so he &apos;s un@@ recogni@@ z@@ able .
and they didn &apos;t care whether you became a doctor or a law@@ yer or a general , and they never expected any gener@@ als in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
so , when i got to the village , i said , &quot; can you take me to the square building ?
i stand with my back to the door so john@@ ny can &apos;t bu@@ st in the room and see that i &apos;m not doing anything , and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something .
and it doesn &apos;t just apply to compu@@ tation .
there &apos;s the whole action there , sitting , kind of , on the side , and the dum@@ my head and our recor@@ ding engine@@ ers standing around while we re@@ build the piano .
and even then -- god is mer@@ ci@@ ful ; for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess is su@@ pre@@ me -- and so , essentially , better if you don &apos;t .
and what has it ignor@@ ed ?
thank you once again .
i want to play a bad guy . i want to rob a bank .
think of your di@@ sh@@ was@@ her or your t-@@ shirt .
they were men who had been contra@@ ctors , or they had been building hou@@ ses and they had lost their jobs after the h@@ ous@@ ing bo@@ om , and they were in this group because they were fail@@ ing to pay their child support .
this book was published in 19@@ 0@@ 4 .
when we climb that sta@@ ir@@ case , self-@@ interest fa@@ des away , we become just much less self-@@ interested , and we feel as though we are better , no@@ bl@@ er and somehow u@@ pli@@ fted .
but what else could i off@@ er her ?
they &apos;re called den@@ g@@ za@@ ho@@ os -- they &apos;re like p@@ in t@@ ac@@ ks to the ground .
but eventually they did come around .
there &apos;s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn &apos;t sound good to you .
they are all people who demon@@ stra@@ te advanced ability in ma@@ ths and the sci@@ ences .

you know if you are in an aircraft at 3@@ 0,000 feet and the cab@@ in depres@@ su@@ ri@@ zes , you can have oxygen .
and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
which is why we have these four@@ -@@ minute dat@@ es .
there &apos;s the one that cu@@ ts itself .
no , they &apos;re not .
that &apos;s 10 to the si@@ x@@ te@@ ent@@ h . and they con@@ sume one and a half mega@@ watts of power .
and , bud@@ dy , that made us ma@@ d .
who are these people ?
are you going to hu@@ g a tree , or are you going to hu@@ g a child ? pick . &quot;
i &apos;m call@@ ing it the one machine . but we &apos;re lin@@ king data .
the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking .
and indeed i did . it was the very first thing i film@@ ed , which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
he &apos;s lea@@ ving red ink behind .
and i &apos;m showing you core war here , which is an early game that takes advan@@ tage a@@ esthe@@ ti@@ cally of the limi@@ tations of the process@@ or .
it may be a little surprising how many things there are , but it &apos;s not surprising what they are .
and that &apos;s the cru@@ x of it .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
we &apos;re trying to turn them into bar@@ e@@ foot entrepreneurs , little business people .
and so , if you see that texas -- you know , texas and california are under canada , and that south carolina is on top of north carolina , this is the home that i grew up in , ok ?
and wh@@ en@@ ever they made one of the two choices , chose one od@@ or , in this case the blue one over the orange one , we swi@@ tched on the lights .
am i right ? they &apos;re not fri@@ ghten@@ ed of being wrong .
you think about re@@ wards sch@@ em@@ es , air miles .
and there are many others .
and we were now well out of our comfort zone , and in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory .
the amazing thing about this is that it &apos;s controlled by a really tiny set of neurons , about two do@@ zen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns , and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny gan@@ gli@@ on in the cra@@ b is actually in@@ und@@ ated by many , many neuro@@ mod@@ ul@@ ators .
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , &quot; okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supp@@ le@@ ment .
when this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy was probably 30 .
they went from re@@ treating to the nurse &apos;s station to disc@@ uss the various states and needs of patients , to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients , using a simple software tool .
the od@@ ds of getting it are 4@@ ,@@ 1@@ 65 to one .
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
look at that . what are you feeling about it ?
okay , the second story takes place here in gala@@ pa@@ gos .
but rob van lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
like i said , shanghai and copenhagen are both port cities , but in copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two gra@@ pes every single time , or they can take a risk@@ y bet and choose between one and three .
and i &apos;m going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of i@@ con@@ ic things from my life .
thank you .
people will tell you it &apos;s impossible , and that &apos;s exactly why we try to do it .
but they want experience in creating an organization .
we have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking .
this explains most contemporary political de@@ b@@ ates .
but as a si@@ del@@ ine , he happens to collect cor@@ nets .
and that &apos;s actually the br@@ unt of what we do is , people going straight from their work@@ place , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
i think it &apos;s time that we moved beyond the idea of tol@@ er@@ ation and move toward appreci@@ ation of the other .
you feel like you &apos;re clim@@ bing a wall of wood .
i need to think about this some more .
now looking at a few cases , here &apos;s one of the first cases that we had .
and you pur@@ posed this stupid story to national geo@@ graphic .
and when one student like me has some sort of in@@ clin@@ ation or understanding about that mole@@ cule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
so israel , who in the 198@@ 0s lob@@ bi@@ ed for and improved u.s.@@ -@@ iran rela@@ tions now fe@@ ared a u.s.@@ -@@ iran ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement , thinking that it would come at israel &apos;s security interests &apos; expen@@ se , and instead s@@ ought to put iran in increased is@@ ol@@ ation .
it makes all key information about life on earth acc@@ es@@ sible to anyone , on dem@@ and , anywhere in the world .
and these sy@@ nap@@ ses together form the network or the circu@@ it of the brain .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher recei@@ ves them , they pa@@ ste them on the school .
it &apos;s a way of looking for natural explan@@ ations for all phenomen@@ a .
i will tell you by the end of my speech .

if the sun could one day -- and indeed the earth , in fact -- if the earth could read its own astro@@ logical , astron@@ omi@@ cal chart , one day it would say , &quot; not a good day for making plans .
of course , it got much better after that .
things got a bit tri@@ cky when i tried to expen@@ se it at the company .
okay . there we go .
no ger@@ man soldi@@ er fell to the ground .
d@@ g : i already said that this site , from a human perspective , is to@@ xi@@ c as hell .
it takes a long , long time to make these sc@@ or@@ es , and right now i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 1@@ 80 pages in length , and it &apos;s just a big ch@@ unk of my life , and i &apos;m just pulling out hair .
it &apos;s true . n@@ ine@@ ty percent of children do play video games .
can you imagine ? it &apos;s very symbo@@ lic .
to this day , this is the most me@@ d@@ als of honor ever awar@@ ded for a single bat@@ tle .
in america , before the motor vehicle , transportation depen@@ ded enti@@ r@@ ely on the urban horse , which dropped , without re@@ stra@@ int , 25 to 50 pounds of man@@ ure on the streets every day together with a gall@@ on of ur@@ ine .

she dre@@ am@@ t she and thousands of other women ended the b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed .
we had millions see them on tv and on tv news .

this pur@@ ch@@ ase inclu@@ ded mining and hun@@ ting rights , ow@@ ner@@ ship of all land on the island , and a castle with no furniture inclu@@ ded .

then came the second school , the third school , the four@@ th school and a j@@ uni@@ or college .
if you come in you will see us : ev@@ ening time , at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served .

so they took me to a private , ca@@ tholic , elem@@ entary school , which set the foundation for what ended up being my career .

it was a random en@@ coun@@ ter when i was young , and since then , i &apos;ve often wondered about the amazing success of physics in descri@@ bing the reality we wake up in every day .
it &apos;s actually basically three square rooms with a couple of sky@@ lights and stuff .
there are other states that do that , but we don &apos;t .
and i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman &apos;s big , massive , big we@@ dding ring on my finger .
because at pas@@ so@@ ver , when we have to eat un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bread , the rab@@ bis say , what is the difference between d@@ ough that is made into bread , and d@@ ough that is made into un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bread , or &quot; mat@@ za@@ h &quot; ?
the revenue of the top hand@@ ful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today .
they could define the vie@@ wing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual ima@@ gery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this we@@ dding , for example .
the epidemi@@ c was introdu@@ ced to the us by actually one male ste@@ ward on an air@@ line flight , who got the disease in africa and brought it back .
and i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking .
interest@@ ingly , one of those birth defe@@ cts has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s .
we should not fear other countries becoming weal@@ thy .
this dis@@ rup@@ tive ment@@ ality of what food is would essentially open up the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia of what ra@@ w ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents are , even if we just swa@@ pped out , say , one of these for fl@@ our , that would elimin@@ ate so much energy and so much waste .

life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade .
r@@ b : no , he told me ju@@ mp , but once his weight had gone , the bal@@ lo@@ on just shot up to 1@@ 2@@ ,000 feet and i ...
so , it &apos;s a fundamental problem .
could i go there ? who would i meet ?
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
and these were intellectu@@ als or stat@@ es@@ men of the 19@@ th century , and later , 20th century , which looked at europe basically and saw that europe has many things to ad@@ mi@@ re , like science and technology .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
so you can have these really nice things that can &apos;t happen , and it &apos;s a kind of &quot; wow ! &quot; and i want to say &quot; wow ! &quot;
it &apos;s also got a little ch@@ in bar@@ bel here with a blue lu@@ min@@ es@@ cent l@@ ure on it that it can use to attra@@ ct pre@@ y from a long way off .
and i said in the beginning , i wasn &apos;t going to tell you about expor@@ ts .
but the point is , if it &apos;s a production tool , why do we have to worry about that ?
all of the wind in the entire country shu@@ t down for a week .
type the word &quot; define &quot; and then the word you want to know .
currently , what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing bo@@ ats , and they were cle@@ an@@ ing clean lines in an ocean of dir@@ t .
now , we see this space , this three-@@ dimensional environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sorts of appli@@ cations can play out , and map &apos;s dire@@ ctions are really just one of them .

they have signed the p@@ act for peace and treat@@ y in the great la@@ kes region , and they end@@ or@@ se her@@ o rats to clear their common bor@@ ders of land@@ min@@ es .
but that &apos;s just the beginning .
peter don@@ n@@ el@@ ly : how ju@@ ries are fo@@ ol@@ ed by statistics
it was mi@@ ke that got me invi@@ ted to the squ@@ id sum@@ mit , a gather@@ ing of squ@@ id experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week .
however , there &apos;s a basic ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic problem here .
so let me go from an example to something very specific and personal .
whatever . i don &apos;t know . &quot;
it needs to perform on p@@ ar or better than the best products on the market .
6@@ 2 percent of our population is below the age of 24 .
we ex@@ hal@@ e carbon di@@ o@@ xi@@ de , so does my@@ ce@@ li@@ um .
d@@ h : a type of ju@@ ggl@@ ing i actually invented , right after i saw another ju@@ ggl@@ er do it .
and if you &apos;re thinking of the brain as a computer , this is the transi@@ stor .
however , once we elimin@@ ate public funding for the arts , there will be some dra@@ w@@ bac@@ ks .
which number ? one , two , three , four or five ?
they &apos;re fully functional , fiel@@ d-@@ te@@ sted , ready to roll out .
so imagine you &apos;re inside the big bang .
a wonderful book , where she talks about universal city walk as -- you know , she de@@ cri@@ es the fake , but she says , at least that &apos;s a real fake , right , because you can see behind the fac@@ ade , right ?
local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be bal@@ in@@ ese , and this was a really big com@@ mit@@ ment .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
i really miss the old tel@@ em@@ ar@@ ke@@ ters now , i &apos;ll tell you that .
i went from living in a house with five guys in pal@@ o al@@ to and living off their le@@ f@@ to@@ vers , to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .
and let me explain what i mean .
my mother worked hard in the farm to grow cro@@ ps so that we can eat .
how did look at the stuff in your life ?
it &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved w@@ ins .
i &apos;d like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy , and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they &apos;re communi@@ cating with other people outside of science .
me was trying not to be an out@@ come of my violent past , but the separ@@ ation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant out@@ come .
here &apos;s one such fru@@ strated scientist , mo@@ she pri@@ t@@ sk@@ er , the fo@@ under of jo@@ ve .
if you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ olo@@ gist .
bab@@ bage was totally obsessed with mathematics .
i had some very interesting conver@@ sations , as you can imagine .
the cro@@ ws learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the co@@ in to come out , put the co@@ in in the s@@ lot , and then they get their pe@@ an@@ u@@ t .
so , i grew up in this neighborhood . when i was 15 years old , i went from being what i think was a stra@@ pping young athle@@ te , over four months , slowly wa@@ sting away until i was basically a fam@@ ine victi@@ m with an un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able thir@@ st .
thank you .
on mar@@ ch 14 , this year , i po@@ sted this poster on facebook .
so imagine you have carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes growing inside a 3d prin@@ ter , and they are em@@ bed@@ ded inside a mat@@ ri@@ x of plastic , and follow the forces which occur in your compon@@ ent .
they are the future and i try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told , don &apos;t think outside the box .
for some reason it explo@@ des , and you begin to get these things .
it is appro@@ ved under an f@@ da@@ i@@ de at the university of virginia in char@@ lot@@ tes@@ ville using focused ultras@@ ound to ab@@ late a point in his thal@@ am@@ us .
well , i think all of you can guess that 12 years on , we &apos;re still nowhere near that goal .
so when i was a star@@ ving post-@@ do@@ c at colum@@ bia university , i was deep in a publi@@ sh@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ per@@ ish phase of my career .
i mean there &apos;s like -- there &apos;s a meth@@ od that can be dep@@ lo@@ yed for various things .
we call it rock@@ et@@ c@@ am .
because it is the most proble@@ matic chemical element .
four very different habi@@ tat@@ s might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen sig@@ nat@@ ures .
the younger , maybe not .
in order to do what i do , you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry .
look , i lied to the fe@@ ds . i lost a year of my life from it .
artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do , sometimes pushing into what they can &apos;t do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
thank you .
but i really did stru@@ g@@ gle for financial support .
take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and i promise you , you will find it much col@@ der at da@@ wn and much hot@@ ter at mid@@ day than that same piece of ground if it &apos;s just covered with li@@ tter , plant li@@ tter .
so imagine that there is an imag@@ in@@ ary line out here , so everyone here will be group a , everyone out here will be group b .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
that was the level of r@@ he@@ t@@ ori@@ c .
you &apos;re in tri@@ bes here . hop@@ efully you &apos;re exten@@ ding the reach of the tri@@ bes that you have .
&quot; well this is very valuable .
so let &apos;s have a look here on my victi@@ m computer .
so that &apos;s the first kind of invi@@ sible innovation coming out of india .
all the things we &apos;re going to walk through in our explor@@ ations and discover@@ ies of the oceans were mostly discover@@ ies made by accident .
fortunately , her lu@@ mp pro@@ ved to be ben@@ ig@@ n .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate -- in fact , of the order of two to four trilli@@ on doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth of natural capital .
let &apos;s see , such as my street ju@@ ggl@@ ing , for example .
we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools .
where they have the same kind of security to take risks .
and i know that i have been waiting all week to tell this jo@@ ke .
and so she can &apos;t move out .
it &apos;s the effect of looking for harmon@@ y in the con@@ tradi@@ ction that exists in a poet &apos;s mind , a con@@ tradi@@ ction that exists in a story@@ teller &apos;s mind .
i don &apos;t think we need to worry about that .
i want to talk now about er@@ r@@ ors in value .
and so i ask myself , i &apos;m starting to ask myself now , even before this extreme dream gets achi@@ ev@@ ed for me , i &apos;m asking myself , and maybe i can ask you tonight too , to par@@ ap@@ hrase the poet mary oli@@ ver , she says , &quot; so what is it , what is it you &apos;re doing , with this one wild and preci@@ ous life of y@@ ours ? &quot;
i just instead said , &quot; i &apos;m going to make something out of it , and maybe next year ... &quot; and i appreci@@ ate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who &apos;ve already given me so much sol@@ ace , and just say to ted@@ sters : i &apos;m proud of me . that i take something bad , i turn it , and i &apos;m going to make something good out of this , all these pieces .
and we believe that it &apos;s in this way that the different to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behavi@@ ors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanze@@ e popu@@ lations studied in africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next , through obser@@ vation , imi@@ tation and practice , so that we can describe these to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behavi@@ ors as primitive culture .
so what you want to focus on instead is allo@@ wing your lower body to dra@@ ft behind your upper body , much like a small car behind a big car on the high@@ way .
and many times i don &apos;t see afri@@ cans working with them .
we see people on our scre@@ ens .
pm : but by putting yourself personally out there -- both proje@@ cting a different image of ye@@ men@@ i women , but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal dan@@ ger ?
because we lived sc@@ at@@ tered .
and , if you &apos;re going to make a personal op@@ era , what about a personal instrument ?
the team is proud of our four attemp@@ ts .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
because if you do the math , you have a thousand ted@@ talks , the pay 10 c@@ ents each ; you have to do more than one sum@@ mary for each of those talks , because some of them will probably be , or are , really bad .
as he corre@@ ctly gu@@ essed , some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun .
they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for s@@ elling shoes , and they wrote tele@@ grams back to man@@ che@@ ster .
this is also , i think , con@@ fir@@ med by the fact that the se@@ clu@@ sion of women in creating a divi@@ ded society is something that you also do not find in the koran , the very core of islam -- the di@@ vine core of islam that all musli@@ ms , and equ@@ ally myself , believe .
sol@@ ly on the bank sees that i &apos;m in trouble .
but the ir@@ ony is , of course , that angel@@ a can do this because she &apos;s the one person who you know would never , ever , ever break any rules of wikipedia .
you say , you say , &quot; um@@ m ... that &apos;s risk@@ y , kid .
what &apos;s important about this is these shapes are du@@ als of each other .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to sha@@ do@@ w , we fall so fast to bar@@ b@@ ari@@ a .
shame is an epidemi@@ c in our culture .
so i &apos;m sort of thinking , &quot; well , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know if i want to get up@@ set with this yet . &quot;
so thank you very much .
on the other hand , the nation is too big .
here are the robots that they inspi@@ re , the me@@ cho@@ -@@ ge@@ ck@@ os from i@@ robot .
after all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ dest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
but there is one other reason why india fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of wood and a ru@@ b@@ ber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
all of them come from the cameras of american soldiers .
in 200@@ 1 , the u@@ pri@@ sing es@@ cal@@ ated into an arm@@ ed conflict , and one of the major inci@@ dents was the destru@@ ction of the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp in the west bank town of jen@@ in .
because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
sex is a place you go . it &apos;s a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
and the next day , when i wo@@ ke up in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of tele@@ phones and t@@ v@@ s and laptops , the days seemed to stre@@ tch for a thousand hours .
but the difficul@@ ty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects pra@@ g@@ matic chaos has .
fol@@ ded lens , you divi@@ de up the pan@@ els , you add fle@@ x@@ ures .
oh , yeah . there , okay . j@@ -@@ o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bo@@ w . that bo@@ w helps .
and that to me , spo@@ ke vol@@ um@@ es , because it &apos;s -- the film started about a tru@@ e-@@ life story about a woman who was har@@ as@@ sed , su@@ ed her emplo@@ yer , led to a land@@ mark case that led to the equal opportunity act , and the violence against women act and others .
they &apos;re wrong .
the first is vulner@@ ability is not weak@@ ness .
women tend to get inti@@ ma@@ cy differently than men do .
this is an inter@@ ior design fir@@ m that is literally called ut@@ opia .
and we &apos;re very care@@ ful about the brains that we do take .
so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very , very large budget .
developing the sky@@ car has been a real challenge .
i figured it &apos;d be popular with the young kids .
there &apos;s only 8@@ ,000 bas@@ king shark fe@@ mal@@ es in the world ?
this made it un@@ profi@@ table for some farmers to even harv@@ est the gra@@ in from the fiel@@ ds .
im@@ pose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fe@@ es .
now , the satur@@ n system is a rich planet@@ ary system .
and then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; can you give me some ? &quot;
and it &apos;s those c@@ ables in particular that i want to focus on .
but they have two types of gi@@ ll structures .
el@@ se@@ where in africa there was fam@@ ine .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
so here i am taking care of bec@@ k at 2@@ 1,000 feet , and i felt what i was doing was completely tri@@ vi@@ al compar@@ ed to what he had done for himself .
suddenly , here we are .
we had to wait now and see what happened .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
i mean , i had to check the tags and make sure .
is it miser@@ able ? it doesn &apos;t seem to be .
so , we do something a little bit more serious .
and we go through this several ro@@ unds .
do you wake up in the night sometimes , just asking questions about the possibly un@@ inten@@ ded consequences of your team &apos;s brilli@@ ance ?
what else could it possibly be if it wasn &apos;t the pil@@ ls ?
you will be able to look at all the aspe@@ cts that make you yourself , all your experiences .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before we &apos;ll be able to perform a face@@ book@@ - or goo@@ g@@ le-@@ like search and see a complete picture of someone &apos;s behavi@@ ors in different con@@ tex@@ ts over time .
well , in bas@@ e@@ ball , you play to win .
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work .
the solution , in fact , may be clo@@ ser to hand than we think , because all of those cities we &apos;re building are opportunities .
even on the first view , your eyes will success@@ fully pick out patterns , but on re@@ pe@@ ated views , your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information .
this is the wrong way of looking at it .
at the beginning , they &apos;re all going to be very bor@@ ing .
and you can see other countries as well .
i want to leave this up here and come back to it .
sales tri@@ pl@@ ed . why ?
and indeed , there are now three academic arti@@ cles in which they &apos;ve looked at this attra@@ ction , which may only last for a second , but it &apos;s a defini@@ te attra@@ ction , and either this same brain region , this re@@ ward system , or the chemi@@ c@@ als of that re@@ ward system are involved .
and it was for , you gu@@ essed it , speed yoga .
of course , first you have break@@ fast , and then you fill the sh@@ ell full of bon@@ do and pain@@ t it and na@@ il it up , and you have an architectural button in just a fra@@ ction of the time .
the glo@@ ves go away in a matter of months or years .
who is that going to come from ?
it doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
deli@@ ver@@ ing the power and the band@@ wid@@ th into the ocean will dramatically acceler@@ ate adap@@ tation .
it &apos;s the green@@ est building in the world .
it bran@@ ches on more the experim@@ ental side .
for too long now , children with develop@@ mental dis@@ orders have suff@@ ered from mis@@ diagno@@ sis while their real problems have gone un@@ dete@@ cted and left to wor@@ sen .
it taught me -- it gave me a greater appreci@@ ation , an understanding for the present moment .
and not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the bro@@ a@@ der community .
so health leads was born of these conver@@ sations -- a simple model where doctors and nur@@ ses can pres@@ cri@@ be nutri@@ ti@@ ous food , heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they pres@@ cri@@ be medi@@ cation .
so , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ?
they basically looked at it and said , &quot; car 1.@@ 0 we &apos;ll solve everything within the car itself . &quot;
we have the south@@ ern right whale that we see here and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and cal@@ f off the coast of florida .
ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables are no longer a fr@@ inge activity .
well , that &apos;s because they &apos;re all young .
and business creates them when it &apos;s able to meet a need at a profit .
now i was getting a little anxi@@ ous .
and in order to do that , you also need oce@@ an-@@ basi@@ n management regi@@ mes .
but also , it &apos;s extremely expensive , co@@ sting 800 dollars per test , and it &apos;s gross@@ ly in@@ accu@@ rate , missing 30 percent of all pan@@ crea@@ tic can@@ cers .
it is emp@@ ha@@ ti@@ cally an out@@ door public room .
secon@@ dar@@ ily , we wanted to see if we could ex@@ port this dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation and bring it into other countries .
there was a time when you played cricket , you played ti@@ mel@@ ess test mat@@ ches , when you played on till the game got over .
how have i in@@ sul@@ ted my ho@@ st ? &quot;
we &apos;re really hoping he thanks us for that later on .
here &apos;s some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year &apos;s minim@@ um of the ar@@ c@@ tic sea ice , and it &apos;s the lo@@ west by far .
ph : how come ?
an emerging opportunity came -- didn &apos;t have time to get everybody together .
it is very ti@@ ring . yeah ?
and he could still hold his wife &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do butt@@ ons on his clo@@ th@@ es , can &apos;t feed himself .
and the tiny water cr@@ yst@@ als here now look for all the world like they are fro@@ zen dro@@ ple@@ ts of sal@@ ty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the je@@ ts come from po@@ ck@@ ets of li@@ qu@@ id water , but that that li@@ qu@@ id water is in cont@@ act with rock .
i &apos;ve always been attra@@ cted to those r@@ are people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the gr@@ it of the war@@ ri@@ or and the gra@@ ce of the my@@ stic -- people like martin luther king , j@@ r . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
what was remarkable is , they expl@@ ored this key@@ board on their own . there was no inter@@ vention on our part .
that &apos;s where those big pe@@ a@@ ks are over to the left .
over 85 percent of all pan@@ crea@@ tic can@@ cers are diagno@@ sed late , when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival .
all those in fa@@ vor , raise your hands .
there was a time in which , i don &apos;t know , people who were black couldn &apos;t have the same rights .
so you must have pati@@ ence .
now , if you were to go down to , say , 300 feet , you don &apos;t have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs -- you &apos;ve got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs .
if we did , it would be a complete mess , because there &apos;s a lot of stuff out there .
and i &apos;m present@@ ing it here at ted . why ?
a few days later , we received a call : &quot; is the data available and can it be used for re@@ construction ? &quot;
but i was a little disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted -- pretty young -- but i went back again a few years later and this time was in california , and i went to ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y .
walk up to it and s@@ ma@@ ck it on the back@@ side . &quot;
then come con@@ vul@@ sions .
there are many organ@@ isms that build their sh@@ ells out of cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate -- plants and animals both .

shame is a focus on self , gu@@ il@@ t is a focus on behavior .
some of these economi@@ es were ru@@ led by auth@@ ori@@ t@@ arian governments in the 60s and 7@@ 0s and 198@@ 0s .
and those hero@@ es did not need an army behind them .
in fact , i don &apos;t read much of anything .
the only other thing is , it was a real sho@@ ck .
and i didn &apos;t give the talk always . you did , and we had to watch you , and so forth .
it was three son@@ y &quot; h &quot; devi@@ ces that respon@@ ded to sound .
women are moving back into the job market .
as a result , what happens ?
he wouldn &apos;t have gran@@ ted the c@@ art , and he had a very interesting dis@@ sent .
well , it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts , and that looked like the end of the story , but some@@ time last year , a young couple got married .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundam@@ entally , people are communi@@ cating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most inti@@ mate sphere .
and i recently made a film called &quot; the budd@@ h@@ ist science of the mind . &quot;
in my talk today , i &apos;ve told you a little bit about min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing , a vari@@ able that i think turns out to be fair@@ ly important in the equation for happiness .
these chri@@ sti@@ ans , who are these chri@@ sti@@ ans ?
okay .
it &apos;s a slow , deli@@ ber@@ ative process of discovery .
you can go onto our website , nation@@ al@@ geo@@ graphi@@ c@@ .com / geno@@ graphic .
so i &apos;ve gone and got some stuff to add into it .
they &apos;re my students , my friends .
no , the pi@@ one@@ er is the one who allows himself to throw over@@ board a lot of bal@@ last .
ge@@ ology has these effects , which is moving the pl@@ ates around and so forth .
those fe@@ mal@@ es are pas@@ sing the p@@ c@@ bs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their off@@ spring , and their off@@ spring don &apos;t survive .
the same thing -- ar@@ ches are very glam@@ or@@ ous .
if you talk with a sad person , you &apos;re going to adop@@ t a sad expression and a sad post@@ ure , and before you know it you feel sad .
he &apos;s going to put something in its hand , he &apos;s going to bring it over here , press a button and let go of that thing in the hand .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
the beautiful thing is that it mo@@ ves bo@@ di@@ ly .
you needed to get life out of this jun@@ k that is present on the early earth , four , 4@@ .@@ 5 billion years ago .
the other point i &apos;d like to make about this is that this ocean &apos;s inter@@ connected .
it &apos;s a way to bring power to the developing world , because it &apos;s produced in a factory and it &apos;s cheap .
you take the profit from that to buy more ads .
at that point , we &apos;ll start roman@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing the future again , instead of the na@@ sty , bru@@ tish past .
you probably think that the force that i led was all ste@@ el@@ y-@@ e@@ yed com@@ man@@ do@@ s with big k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le fi@@ sts carrying exo@@ tic weapons .
now for some people , that seems to lead to an idea of ni@@ hi@@ li@@ sm .
there is an infinite game , and we &apos;re playing in that infinite game .
this was initi@@ ated in delhi prison .
think about all the services we have online .
we have to accept that there will be ha@@ z@@ ards .
there was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we &apos;re in this together , and that if we united and we inter@@ cultur@@ ally co@@ oper@@ ated , then that might be the key to humanity &apos;s survival .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the ter@@ ror , illegal and cri@@ minal economy .

in order to pull glamour off , you need this ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance quality of spre@@ zz@@ at@@ ur@@ a , which is a term co@@ ined by ca@@ sti@@ gli@@ one in his book , &quot; the book of the cour@@ tier . &quot;
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
and i have a ti@@ p for you . if you have to work in spaces like that , carry head@@ phones with you , with a so@@ o@@ thing sound like bir@@ d@@ song .
so i just bought one speci@@ men of everything which was sold on the ro@@ ad@@ side .
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to in@@ surance .
you can get the t@@ one and the ti@@ m@@ b@@ re and the p@@ ace of the speech , things that you can &apos;t get out of clo@@ sed cap@@ tioning .
but even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : the expansion must be slo@@ wing down .
why was this horri@@ ble little building so important to their ren@@ own and their innovation ?
and nobody cele@@ br@@ ates imi@@ tation the way &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; guys know it has to be done .
and sure enough -- i &apos;ve never been in one , but appar@@ ently they go all around the bu@@ ses and the trucks and it &apos;s cra@@ zy and it &apos;s no@@ is@@ y and it &apos;s exciting .
the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence .
these are enormous forces .
one on the extreme right is a photograph of an american foot@@ b@@ aller .
this is the board , this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work .
but who is going to want to pl@@ u@@ g them in ?
well , yes , you had a big aid program . thank you very much .
so , i &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many .
so there &apos;s an interesting discussion going on there .
a nation explo@@ ding in conversation in real time in response to what &apos;s on the broad@@ cast .
and their parents , the kid &apos;s parents might have done some of these things when they were young , but not many parents have written apps .
the thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
they were actually high school class@@ mat@@ es together at the same high school in subur@@ ban los an@@ gl@@ es in the 196@@ 0s .
so that &apos;s just to give a sense of scale .
let &apos;s find out .
so this is a form of synthe@@ tic hy@@ bri@@ di@@ zation of the genome of an extin@@ ct species with the genome of its clo@@ sest living relative .
repor@@ ter jen@@ ni@@ fer 8 . lee talks about her h@@ unt for the ori@@ g@@ ins of familiar chin@@ es@@ e-@@ american di@@ shes -- explor@@ ing the hidden spots where these two cultur@@ es have comb@@ ined to form a new cu@@ is@@ ine .
ways of controlling , pre@@ venting soil erosion .
now , what did we do ? we &apos;re co@@ wards , but we &apos;re smart co@@ wards .
voice : what kind of disease ?
our cam@@ er@@ am@@ an , who it turned out was a pretty ner@@ v@@ ous fl@@ yer at the best of times , actually asked the pilot , before we got on the plane , how long this flight would take , and the pilot -- russi@@ an pilot -- completely dead@@ p@@ an , repli@@ ed , &quot; six hours -- if we live . &quot;
and then the pilot didn &apos;t go and i was so sad , but i kept rema@@ ining a fan of y@@ ours .
and my country reli@@ es on its security through military alli@@ ance , that &apos;s clear .
it &apos;s sad , and it &apos;s not pleas@@ ant to talk about , but your husband might leave you , your gir@@ l@@ friend could che@@ at , your he@@ ada@@ ches might be more serious than you thought , or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .
how does this work ? basically , i send people signals at random points throughout the day , and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment@@ -@@ to-@@ moment experience at the inst@@ ant just before the signal .
you can do it in a beautiful place as well , like in a la@@ ke .
i actually love di@@ ving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the da@@ y@@ time .
the golf clu@@ bs were ow@@ ned by john f@@ . kennedy and sold for three-@@ quar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ ction .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
the her@@ d was safe within the con@@ fin@@ es of the park , because of this de@@ di@@ cated group of park ran@@ gers .
and over time , these neu@@ ral path@@ ways become hard@@ wi@@ red , they become the norm -- even if it &apos;s bad for us because it causes us stress and anxi@@ ety .
the way to break down the si@@ los is to get inter@@ -@@ oper@@ ability between social net@@ working sites .
ok , here we go .
so we collect this m@@ r .
i did not want to re@@ cap the cr@@ ash with ab@@ ed .
afterwards , the camp -- just having the camp -- increases imm@@ uni@@ zation from six percent to 17 percent .
so , that one is his .
we made do@@ zens of prototy@@ pes to get to this .
this was the big bang , the beginning of the universe .
a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of energy and ideas , stephen ri@@ tz is a teacher in new york &apos;s tough south bronx , where he and his kids grow l@@ us@@ h gar@@ dens for food , gre@@ ener@@ y -- and jobs . just try to keep up with this new york tre@@ asure as he sp@@ ins through the many , many ways there are to grow hope in a neighborhood many have written off , or in your own . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i can choose the next american i@@ do@@ l . you &apos;re fi@@ red .
derek si@@ vers : how to start a movement
he stayed late at night every day .
we know how to deal with these fel@@ lo@@ ws , &quot; and ignor@@ ed them .
he &apos;s foc@@ using all his attention on getting himself out of trouble .
our 27 percent o@@ be@@ sity rate is high , even for this country , and diabetes comes with it .
i could not have asked for a better pro@@ of of concept .
and she &apos;s listening to various languages in the ear@@ phones that are in her e@@ ars .
it &apos;s totally strange .
mo@@ unds visuali@@ zes the entire dat@@ as@@ et as large , gel@@ at@@ in@@ ous blo@@ bs which kind of j@@ ig@@ gle .
and so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing ri@@ ches in .
it br@@ ings to mind a head@@ line i saw recently : &quot; education : the great divi@@ de . &quot;
what year , chris , would you like ?
this is &quot; sle@@ ep , &quot; the virtual cho@@ ir .
bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
it &apos;s when my dad told me , &quot; here , i give you this girl as your fi@@ ance . &quot;
when you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest pri@@ ority .
es@@ sex only pa@@ ys in the ev@@ ent that it &apos;s saving them care costs .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of embar@@ ras@@ sing myself , because i think part of the work of femin@@ ism is to ad@@ mit that a@@ esthe@@ tics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
the first is a kin@@ e@@ ct camera , which will be out in nov@@ ember , some incredible a@@ i that was hidden in the du@@ sty v@@ au@@ l@@ ts , colle@@ cting dust in microsoft , plus our quite cru@@ de attemp@@ ts at a@@ i at a company called li@@ on@@ head , mix@@ ing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea : to create a real , living being in a computer .
as you can see here , there &apos;s some direct light on the floor , but they could easily figure out where that comes from .
and then that signature is lost .
i was seeing myself not from my perspective , but vi@@ vi@@ dly and continu@@ ously from the perspective of other people &apos;s respon@@ ses to me .
and so we pe@@ er through a legal microscop@@ e , and look at everything .
because there is this as@@ ym@@ me@@ try , which creates , basically , fail@@ ing govern@@ ance .
that &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
d@@ h : then here we go .
but when i saw that , i said , &quot; maybe the problem is just an auth@@ ori@@ t@@ arian culture in the region , and some musli@@ ms have been influ@@ enced by that .
this is ab@@ un@@ dance , which is exactly what we want our economic system to provide .
and that went on for about two years , until -- i think i was about 12 -- my dad brought home a lincoln mark i@@ i@@ i .
using three i@@ po@@ ds like magi@@ cal pro@@ ps , mar@@ co temp@@ est sp@@ ins a clever , surpri@@ sing@@ ly hear@@ t@@ felt meditation on truth and lies , art and emotion .
so he comes over to this country , and he says , &quot; we need a big fi@@ s@@ cal sti@@ mul@@ us . &quot;
it &apos;s nearly hal@@ f@@ way around the globe .
here you can see that the insects are being tra@@ cked as they &apos;re flying around , which is kind of fun .
the system was designed to au@@ gment human intelligence , it was called .
that &apos;s what the celebra@@ tion is all about .
so when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els .
we were very lucky to have two of our part@@ ners participa@@ te in this : the historic scot@@ land , and the glas@@ go@@ w school of art .
comm@@ un@@ al value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggre@@ gate of shared , publi@@ c@@ ly available data , whether it &apos;s photos on fli@@ ck@@ r or videos on youtube or whatever .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of bin@@ ary , you need a device .
now in the mean@@ time , the two dan@@ ish guys to the left of the camera , they &apos;re cra@@ cking up .
while we can &apos;t say exactly how fast these am@@ pli@@ fying feed@@ bac@@ ks will occur , it is certain they will occur , unless we stop the warming .
we have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to co@@ ok again , because , of course , they don &apos;t -- because we &apos;ve had this process@@ ed food in schools and institutions for so long .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our dem@@ and@@ s .
there is a lot of var@@ ni@@ sh still sitting there , several re@@ tou@@ ches , and some over cle@@ an@@ ing . it becomes very vi@@ sible .
40 years later , a@@ er@@ o experts co@@ ined the term tran@@ son@@ ic .
and it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycl@@ ing .
but there &apos;s another dinosau@@ r that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops , except it &apos;s bigger , and it &apos;s called torosaurus .
you can &apos;t just go around going , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to put some tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es in a circle and they &apos;re going to be symmetri@@ cal . and they &apos;re all going to add up , and it &apos;s going to be , oh yeah , i figured that out . &quot;
kids do art .
they seem to have the exper@@ ti@@ se to keep cars working .
it was first ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ated in 196@@ 1 as they were building la@@ x , although scientists believe that it dat@@ es back to the year 2000 before common era , when it was used as a bu@@ sy trans@@ dimensional space port by the ancient astron@@ au@@ ts who first coloni@@ zed this planet and rais@@ ed our species from sa@@ va@@ gery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revol@@ ving restaurants .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
we are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts .
when i was 11 , i wanted to be left alone .
the po@@ em is called &quot; no man is an island . &quot;
in the fall of 20@@ 11 peter nor@@ vi@@ g taught a class with sebastian th@@ run on artifi@@ cial intelligence at stanford atten@@ ded by 17@@ 5 students in si@@ tu -- and over 100,000 via an inter@@ active web@@ cast . he shares what he learned about teaching to a global classroom .
i &apos;ll tell you what that theory was soon enough .
they &apos;re so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it .
they don &apos;t want secon@@ d-@@ standard , secon@@ d-@@ quality out@@ puts .
and you get to think about yourself and your memor@@ ies , and before you go back into su@@ spen@@ sion , you edi@@ t your memor@@ ies and you change your person@@ ality and so forth .
because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader , a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity , takes away a choice that people in the economy want .
this is the most well-@@ known example , ta@@ da@@ o and@@ o &apos;s church of light .
that &apos;s a much higher number than in the u.s. or u.@@ k .
anybody ? nobody .
now that can work well for an individual lear@@ ner , and i encoura@@ ge , one , for you to do it with your kids , but i also encoura@@ ge everyone in the audience to do it yourself .
where do they get their re@@ produ@@ ctive resources ?
so although i had every reason to be fe@@ ar@@ ful of what was ahead , and had no clu@@ e quite what was going to happen , i was alive .
is he bald in front ? does he wear glasses ? &quot;
when we land@@ ed on the dro@@ p@@ -@@ zone , everything had changed .
i &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ an@@ ced people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
but it can go beyond data , and it can go beyond numbers .
so we can &apos;t rel@@ ate to her . and when you can &apos;t rel@@ ate to somebody , you don &apos;t en@@ vy them .
this is a place called the ma@@ dan@@ gir@@ i sett@@ le@@ ment colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these charac@@ ters who showed me around for the day .
the blue system . the vio@@ let . it &apos;s all there .
and i may say , i may not see the church , or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow .
some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family .
this , as you know , is an act of her@@ es@@ y .
so the bottom line is , maybe it was where to go to work , and you met the love of your life there .
he wasn &apos;t the only man in america who suff@@ ered in a pre-@@ civil rights america .
they need an inclu@@ sive process where the real fabri@@ c of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
what you get is a highly sele@@ ctive loss of one function , with other functions being pres@@ er@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this gives you some confidence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in medi@@ ating that function .
because we also need your intellectu@@ al capital : your ideas , your skills , your in@@ genu@@ ity .
other data has the music industry at about 4@@ 5,000 people .
we had condoms in all the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators in the hotels and the schools , because al@@ co@@ ho@@ l im@@ pa@@ irs jud@@ gment .
cou@@ l@@ om@@ b , in fr@@ ance , found the same law for electri@@ c char@@ ges .
but once the bones had f@@ used together it would have been healthy .
here are the top five things that people with post-@@ trau@@ matic growth say : my priori@@ ties have changed . i &apos;m not afraid to do what makes me happy .
so , will we find the whole of physics ?
but i bor@@ row a lesson that i learned from him .
by meas@@ uring it , the act of meas@@ u@@ rement changes it .
for instance , the re@@ sting brain ten@@ ds to generate a lot of al@@ ph@@ a waves .
so , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or illu@@ sions or so on and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the cro@@ p cir@@ cles .
electronics ki@@ ts are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts inher@@ ent in their design influ@@ ence the way we learn .
we write our own stuff , repli@@ cate it , and are very proud of ourselves .
now , what does this have to do with energy ?
so , for example , the middle line there , 0@@ .@@ 1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of sau@@ di ar@@ abi@@ a , nor@@ way , mexi@@ co in purple , and banglades@@ h 15 years ago , and half of the world &apos;s population lives in countries that are already above that line .
and who is this guy , al@@ e@@ x , to begin with ?
what you see here is a ma@@ dly s@@ warming mass of particles , each of which represents a single human feeling that was st@@ ated in the last few hours .
&quot; you know , it &apos;s the end of an error &#91; si@@ c &#93; .
this is the ke@@ ck obser@@ v@@ at@@ ory . it ho@@ sts two telescop@@ es with a mi@@ r@@ ror 10 me@@ ters , which is roughly the diam@@ e@@ ter of a ten@@ nis cour@@ t .
this particular one is called e@@ et@@ wi@@ dom@@ a@@ y@@ lo@@ h , &quot; he who gre@@ ets with fire , &quot; and you can just see that about him , you know -- that &apos;s his character .
well , i found a way to use it .
and i gave the grand@@ mother my business card .
i want to show you a couple of examples why .
and of course , this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hi@@ ding , as they di@@ vine their rou@@ te to take us out of the mountains .
and they get to the top and let &apos;s say there &apos;s some lea@@ ves there .
so the ultras@@ oni@@ c trans@@ du@@ cer e@@ mi@@ ts basically an ultras@@ oni@@ c be@@ am that foc@@ uses inside the ph@@ an@@ tom .
here , here , ken@@ ya , east africa , they &apos;ve actually just come out of a long dr@@ ought .
but there &apos;s a second model for argu@@ ing : arguments as pro@@ o@@ fs .
if i had ever gone home and told those im@@ migr@@ ant people that , &quot; you know , i &apos;m ti@@ red of school and i &apos;m dropping out , &quot; they &apos;d said , &quot; we &apos;re dropping you out . we &apos;ll get another kid . &quot;
we don &apos;t know -- again with tamiflu , the number one side effect of tamiflu is flu@@ -like symptoms .
we tried , with a tiny little piece of lim@@ bur@@ ger che@@ ese , which sm@@ ells bad@@ ly after feet , to attra@@ ct african malaria mosquitos .
they all have a small power per unit area , and we have to live with that fact .
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i cli@@ cked on , and it was noti@@ cing that , actually , i was cli@@ cking more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; links than on my conser@@ va@@ tive friends &apos; links .
it &apos;s going to come gradu@@ ally at first . it &apos;s going to pick up speed .
we began to find limb bones ; we found finger bones , the bones of the p@@ el@@ v@@ is , ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e , ri@@ bs , the col@@ lar bones , things that had never , ever been seen before in hom@@ o ere@@ ctu@@ s .
since he was a great teacher , len@@ ny ber@@ n@@ stein always started from the meaning . look at this , please .
now , on the video , on the video here , i &apos;m going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i &apos;m showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tab@@ let .
hop@@ efully , a dialo@@ g between adul@@ ts and children will happen on many different levels , and hop@@ efully different kinds of hum@@ or will evolve .
it &apos;s a sensi@@ tivity to the physical environment , the ability to pick out patterns in an environment -- der@@ i@@ ve a gist .
and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too .
theater a@@ wa@@ kens our senses and op@@ ens the door to our imagination .
but that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomi@@ c technology .
and also start with a little bit of statistics .
and you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was united states and united kingdom .
if you had 100 million people proper@@ ly spread out , then if there &apos;s some gar@@ bage , you throw it away , prefer@@ ably where you can &apos;t see it , and it will rot .
computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world , but i think they &apos;ve changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group .
so we &apos;ve laun@@ ched a women &apos;s open network this week in i@@ ke@@ a , and we &apos;ll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
some of the teena@@ gers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
so , &quot; son@@ ority is time and meaning &quot; -- a great quote .
on the ban@@ ks of a river called the indu@@ s , now in pakistan .
n@@ ine@@ ty percent of women don &apos;t , and 95 percent of women don &apos;t know that it increases your breast cancer risk .
you come into the magic kingdom and the hot@@ el that tony ba@@ x@@ ter &apos;s group is doing out here .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
and we could also produce power c@@ ables , to trans@@ fer enormous amo@@ un@@ ts of current between power sta@@ tions .
and this next shot here is one of the lun@@ ch@@ rooms .
and am@@ on@@ gst the chaos , a@@ mid@@ st the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wi@@ el@@ ded power before 198@@ 9 , in eastern europe , continued to do so after the revol@@ utions there .
and you talk about it with your friends .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily he agre@@ ed . and the the@@ me , in two years , is going to be &quot; c@@ ute pictures of pu@@ pp@@ ies . &quot;
but here &apos;s what &apos;s true -- we need it . we can do it through inti@@ ma@@ cy , through friend@@ ship , through pra@@ yer , through walking in nature .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west ni@@ le fe@@ ver ?
and the reason for this is because of networks .
and they are very happy with that , appar@@ ently .
a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around .
but he didn &apos;t use new par@@ ch@@ ment , he used par@@ ch@@ ment recycl@@ ed from earlier man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ ts , and there were seven of them .
vi@@ la@@ y@@ an@@ ur ra@@ mach@@ and@@ ran tells us what brain damage can reve@@ al about the connection between celebra@@ l tissue and the mind , using three star@@ t@@ ling del@@ u@@ sions as examples .
no . there &apos;s serious issues in the region .
expl@@ ore this ver@@ tical axis , that means expl@@ ore all the different ways to do , all the different ways to be@@ have , all the different ways to think , before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish .
so we have a diam@@ ond dri@@ ll .
first they don &apos;t grow .
we simply cannot store and main@@ tain or re@@ cycle all our stuff .
all we have to do is create a fab@@ ul@@ ous platform for participa@@ tion -- non@@ tri@@ vi@@ al .
they weren &apos;t mi@@ stakes ; i saw everything that i would have changed and i was embar@@ ras@@ sed by it .
here &apos;s your bru@@ te force approach . once you get through your bru@@ te force approach , then you just ri@@ p off whole moun@@ tain@@ t@@ ops . and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions , which are co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red gas plants . that is probably not the best use of bio@@ energy .
a preci@@ sely similar calcu@@ lation by hawking and g@@ ary gi@@ bb@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates .
even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day .
and they sort of stand as a bu@@ ff@@ er in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside .
wh@@ en@@ ever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge dire@@ ctions .
these kinds of things .
i think we all might have some questions .
thank you .
so we gave some examples of what you could spend it on .
have we stopp@@ ed seeing in@@ justice ?
many other orph@@ ans survived this way , or worse .
it was the winter of 200@@ 9 , and i had been blind for about a year .
thank you so much .
the chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on .
each incre@@ ment gets a seri@@ al number and a cer@@ tifi@@ cate , and then the bre@@ wers and others buy those cer@@ tifi@@ c@@ ates as a way to return water to these degra@@ ded ecosystems .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rat@@ tle .
so , we may be off in the top ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner , slightly unusual , the united kingdom ac@@ compani@@ ed by ger@@ many , japan , south korea , the ne@@ ther@@ lands , and a bunch of other slightly odd countries , but many other countries are coming up and to the right to come and join us , so we &apos;re a picture , if you like , of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too .
and there he is , his dro@@ opy little eyes up here .
but before we p@@ at ourselves too much on the back , we have po@@ u@@ red 15@@ 1 mega@@ watt hours of energy into constru@@ cting this house when there was a house there before .
why is he so str@@ angel@@ y ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to david that he doesn &apos;t understand that david &apos;s not going to fight him until the very last moment ?
i co@@ -@@ fo@@ unded a company called navi@@ geni@@ cs , where , if you sp@@ it into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic mark@@ ers for disease , all of which are del@@ a@@ y@@ able in many of the can@@ cers -- you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
i think the time is right for an agi@@ le family manifest@@ o .
mad@@ die &apos;s using temper@@ ature to extend this phenomenon to a new scen@@ ari@@ o .
if , however , the core issues that prop@@ elled the revolution aren &apos;t addres@@ sed , the consequences could be cat@@ astro@@ phi@@ c -- not just for eg@@ y@@ pt , but for the entire region .
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organi@@ ze the whole thing is .
however , i also think it &apos;s got to do with the fact that bats come out at night , and we don &apos;t really understand them . we &apos;re a little fri@@ ghten@@ ed by things that can per@@ cei@@ ve the world slightly differently than us .
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us se@@ cure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel se@@ cure .

more safe , more se@@ cure . you can be an i@@ os ha@@ cker , make your iphone do stuff it wasn &apos;t supposed to .
boy : no , now you sit around like a bu@@ m all day .
i actually came across this fascinating study by the pe@@ w center this week that reve@@ al@@ ed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as a non-@@ internet user to believe that most people are tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
it car@@ ries male sex cells from one flower to another .
so finally , they put her at the edge of the village in a hu@@ t .
this will be the first building in the united states that took -- well , i can &apos;t say it took the air condi@@ tioning out . it &apos;s a hy@@ bri@@ d .
it was one of the ti@@ tles that i was sort of thinking about call@@ ing my record , except there &apos;s a couple of problems .
al@@ vin and sea cli@@ ff and cy@@ ana , and all the major deep sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les we have , which are about eight .
len@@ n@@ art green : three -- good .
life is temp@@ tation . it &apos;s all about y@@ i@@ el@@ ding , resi@@ sting , yes , no , now , later , impul@@ sive , refle@@ ctive , present focus and future focus .

one : whi@@ t@@ ley st@@ rie@@ ber was played by christ@@ op@@ her wal@@ ken .
you can see the individual structures of the woman .
i think it &apos;s not good , but there you are , that &apos;s my view .
because five years from now , it will b@@ low you away what we &apos;ll actually have as alterna@@ tives to this horri@@ ble , disa@@ str@@ ous nuclear power .
if we don &apos;t take action , we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jer@@ k the str@@ ings that tie us to sla@@ very in the products we buy , and in our government poli@@ cies .
and finally , there &apos;s other combin@@ ations , such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it .
because that had not yet been done . and then it da@@ w@@ ned on me , and here &apos;s part of what i &apos;m saying .
and going out into the community and intervie@@ wing your neighb@@ ors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that &apos;s a home@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment .
day two , you see people running towards police instead of from the police .
she had three kids under the age of 12 , and this is her ct scan .

and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and re@@ program@@ ming mo@@ unds of fat into foun@@ tains of you@@ th@@ ful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other , more speci@@ alized , cells , which one day may be used as cell tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ts .
and i couldn &apos;t for@@ give myself for the coun@@ t@@ less , coun@@ t@@ less hours i had lost in negative thought -- all the time i had spent be@@ ating myself up for losing my marri@@ age and not stopp@@ ing the sexu@@ al ab@@ use when i was a kid and career mo@@ ves and this and this and this .
i met y@@ as@@ ser ar@@ af@@ at .
north central india , the cham@@ b@@ al river is where we have our base .
this is me building a prototy@@ pe for six hours straight .
all of a sudden , human exist@@ ence needed an in@@ tent .
and what follo@@ ws is a stream of images , a series of images cap@@ tured by some of pakistan &apos;s most dynami@@ c and young photo@@ gra@@ pher@@ s , that a@@ im@@ s to give you an alternative gli@@ mp@@ se , a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary paki@@ stan@@ i citizens .
do you know that driving acci@@ dents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
sor@@ cer@@ ess , tran@@ ced , ec@@ sta@@ tic , stock@@ -@@ still on the si@@ de@@ walk ra@@ g@@ ged co@@ at han@@ ging aga@@ pe , pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by flo@@ wing around her , her mouth tor@@ n suddenly open as though in a scre@@ am , sil@@ ently though , as though only in her brain or breast had it er@@ up@@ ted .
and then we have the sen@@ su@@ al fac@@ tor of the face .
when you open it up , it &apos;s going to go &quot; bing ; &quot; it &apos;ll be on ; it &apos;ll use it ; it &apos;ll be just like it was in 198@@ 5 , when you bought an apple ma@@ cin@@ to@@ sh 5@@ 12 .
he sort of mu@@ m@@ bled .
so , i did it .
the problem is that we play the role of victims .
and this is for a chapter that i &apos;m doing in a book , and the chapter is on honor .
americans , incredibly gener@@ ous people -- over 300 billion a year , don@@ ated to chari@@ ty every year , compar@@ ed with the amount of foreign aid given by the top 17 industri@@ alized nations at 1@@ 20 billion .
he said it sort of g@@ le@@ efully .
it post@@ ul@@ ates a vast and rapidly growing number of univer@@ ses exi@@ sting in parallel -- mu@@ tu@@ ally un@@ dete@@ ct@@ able except through the nar@@ row por@@ tho@@ le of qu@@ ant@@ um mechanical experiments .
dur@@ ga , the fe@@ ar@@ less one .
real depen@@ dence on this person .
well , it turns out that there &apos;s been a great deal of spe@@ cu@@ lation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundam@@ entally wrong with go@@ li@@ ath , an attempt to make sense of all of those appar@@ ent an@@ om@@ ali@@ es .
we have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the la@@ ws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions .
and then when i did the second one , it really di@@ stur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cr@@ as@@ hing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of ten@@ sion and an over@@ la@@ p .
genetic engineering cou@@ pl@@ ed with pol@@ y@@ mer physi@@ ot@@ ech@@ nolo@@ gy cou@@ pl@@ ed with x@@ en@@ ot@@ ran@@ sp@@ lan@@ tation .
but for a young man that made a real im@@ pression on me , that one never knows how much time one really has .
one example among many .
microsoft &apos;s stephen law@@ ler gives a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper@@ -@@ real ci@@ ty@@ sc@@ apes with da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty , a remarkable fe@@ at that re@@ quir@@ es sta@@ g@@ ger@@ ing amo@@ un@@ ts of data to bring into focus .
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .
and if you measure very , very carefully with a sti@@ ff arm and a straight edge , you &apos;ll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size .
i &apos;m foc@@ using on biology , the biological sci@@ ences .
and so i think we &apos;re making progress in that direction , and i feel confi@@ dent that we &apos;ll get there .
civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the u.k. , and also in japan , which is not proper@@ ly en@@ for@@ cing , and so on .
it &apos;s another one that lives at the con@@ flu@@ ence of health and enter@@ prise .
the mon@@ key recogni@@ zed that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthe@@ tic arm would do .
so my husband has f@@ ond memor@@ ies of talking to and playing with and generally being around his de@@ ce@@ ased grandfather , and for him there is nothing un@@ natural about this .
it represents a colo@@ s@@ sal waste of food , but what i discovered wh@@ il@@ st i was writing my book was that this very evi@@ dent ab@@ un@@ dance of waste was actually the ti@@ p of the i@@ ce@@ berg .
on my way here on the airplane , i was walking up and down the a@@ is@@ le of the plane .
and then , what &apos;s next ?
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hop@@ e@@ ful picture for the future of america .
i like it when my charac@@ ters surprise me .
well , not always .
i figured out their bi@@ os , their pas@@ sions in life and their art sty@@ les , and i started making their work .
this is just like a resi@@ den@@ cy program , for those of you that are in medical school .
a@@ g : okay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ental not@@ e@@ book out .
weird concept : i hi@@ red you ; i should trust you .
so amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the bl@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton bees project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
and following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it .
and she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
the family won &apos;t listen to reason .
it &apos;s called &quot; to my favorite 17-@@ year-old high school girl . &quot;
gr@@ é@@ go@@ i@@ re cour@@ t@@ ine : the paraly@@ zed rat that walked
maybe you can do it together with other countries .
so actually , it &apos;s filled with 100 billion neurons just zi@@ z@@ zing away , electri@@ cally trans@@ mi@@ tting information , zi@@ z@@ zing , zi@@ z@@ zing . i &apos;m going to give you a little side view here .
they begin to ch@@ ant .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
these are spor@@ es -- this is in their spor@@ es .
and he said , &quot; so what are you going to do to celebra@@ te ? &quot;
that 9@@ 9 percent of the time when a fi@@ re@@ truck is not parking there , it &apos;s in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating pollu@@ tants .
this is all the press we got , and we said , it &apos;s time to celebra@@ te .
it &apos;s the ultimate distribu@@ ted foot : its whole body in this case is acting like its foot .
you &apos;re helping him discover the garden by just poin@@ ting out these s@@ na@@ ils .
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , &quot; look , you guys made this possible . and thank you very much . &quot;
char@@ ley : i &apos;ll stick to my original the@@ sis .
and when do you think that will happen ?
and so it &apos;s giving people more choices , but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
sh : well yeah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly del@@ u@@ sional belief system .
these guys make the lou@@ dest car stere@@ o in the world .
and we get the whole pattern here of the world , which is more or less like this . and if we look at it , how it looks -- the world , in 1960 , it starts to move . 1960 .
so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are accoun@@ t technologies around that allow you to see many , many pieces of dna very quickly .
ok , i &apos;m not going to spend too much time on that , but what i want to talk about is some of the dis@@ conne@@ cts that appe@@ ar when an author publi@@ shes a book that in fact , the publi@@ shing process -- just because of the fact that it &apos;s complicated , it &apos;s heavy , books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between auth@@ ors of books and the ultimate users of books , be they teachers , students or just general re@@ a@@ ders .
so i come up , and i say , &quot; what am i going to do today ? &quot; i &apos;m not going to do what i plan@@ ned to do , and i put myself into absolute pani@@ c .
if it &apos;s more being tra@@ pped on the way out , then you would expect it to be war@@ mer here and cool@@ er here . here is the lower atmosphere .
and our quality of life is going to be sever@@ ely com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed .
but the second thing that &apos;s not shown on here : the earth has never had any ice on it when we &apos;ve had 1,000 parts per million co2 .
and then i pa@@ sted huge po@@ sters everywhere in the b@@ our@@ geo@@ is area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
actually , we found 100 percent is easi@@ er to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
they &apos;ve been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recor@@ ding that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and we can &apos;t just imi@@ tate the past . no .
in fact we &apos;ve done two more blue zone expedi@@ tions since this and these common den@@ om@@ in@@ ators hold true .
the japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
now , the question is , where &apos;s the sound made ?
i am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
but that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet .
another character called j@@ am@@ i has the ability to create fantastic inven@@ tions .
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
now i keep thinking this would be a great name for an in@@ die rock band , but develop@@ ers generally use it to re@@ fer to under@@ used parking lots -- and subur@@ bia is full of them .
do you know these books , these such and such &quot; for dum@@ mies ? &quot;
i mean this comes out .
how many po@@ ets could cra@@ m e@@ bay , friend@@ ster and mon@@ ster@@ .com into 3@@ -@@ minute po@@ em wor@@ thy of a standing o@@ vation ? enjoy ri@@ ves &apos; unique talent .
you should try it yourself .
so si@@ t@@ opia , for me , is really a way of seeing .
something will happen behind it .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
this one s@@ ank carrying a pre@@ fabri@@ cated , home de@@ pot ro@@ man temple .
it was pretty embar@@ ras@@ sing , given what was going on in my mind .
let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
i mean , look : if you can show instead of just descri@@ bing , that problem goes away .
so i started a farm in mis@@ sour@@ i and learned about the economi@@ cs of far@@ ming .
we &apos;re starting to do it in the western pac@@ i@@ fic as well .
would you get any popu@@ la@@ tion-@@ level imm@@ uni@@ ty ?
if you look close , it &apos;s this shape , called a c@@ ran@@ e .
the s@@ laugh@@ ter of millions in the tren@@ ches and in the death cam@@ ps have caused people to ask , &quot; where is god in all this ?
but here in africa , you &apos;ve got these non@@ linear scaling f@@ ences .
it was at that point , just the spar@@ k of an idea .
you send in a picture of your cat if it looks like hit@@ ler .
and jack@@ son pol@@ lock also .
no , no , no .
a lot of them made jo@@ kes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
and what i hope to do , when i make these connections , is short circu@@ it people &apos;s thinking .
sar@@ ah@@ -@@ ja@@ y@@ ne bla@@ ke@@ more : the mysteri@@ ous work@@ ings of the adol@@ es@@ cent brain
but they are not appli@@ c@@ able in all situ@@ ations .
james gl@@ att@@ felder studies complexity : how an inter@@ connected system -- say , a s@@ warm of birds -- is more than the sum of its parts . and complexity theory , it turns out , can reve@@ al a lot about how the economy works . gl@@ att@@ felder shares a gro@@ und@@ brea@@ king study of how control flo@@ ws through the global economy , and how con@@ cent@@ ration of power in the hands of a sho@@ ck@@ ingly small number lea@@ ves us all vulnerable .
so if you were thinking of buying an i@@ pad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
now what if we could achieve that historic two-@@ percent growth for the next 70 years ?
i hope there &apos;s one thing you all won &apos;t forget : in between the time you arri@@ ved here this morning and the time we break for l@@ unch , there are going to be four h@@ omi@@ ci@@ des in the united states .
you &apos;re afraid to look ridiculous .
neuro@@ scientist and invent@@ or christ@@ op@@ her de@@ char@@ ms demon@@ str@@ ates a new way to use f@@ mri to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . in other words , you can actually see how you feel .
i went from des@@ k@@ -@@ d@@ w@@ elling computer ner@@ d to the kind of guy who bi@@ kes to work -- for fun .
they did give me a tour , though .
there was no metaphor . was it a dat@@ ab@@ ase ?
and this orange line here mar@@ ks the typical son@@ gs of east coast hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks .
and if my mother ever questi@@ oned him , he beat her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult .
that this old man would inter@@ ru@@ pt his mo@@ on@@ light stro@@ ll with his s@@ wee@@ the@@ art with the preci@@ se reason of making fun of a child .
i can make it larger or smaller , i can change its br@@ ass to sil@@ ver , i could make it a le@@ ver . i can change your door , put colors on ; i can put windows in . i can change a thousand things about your door , and in the two seconds you take to open your door , you &apos;re going to notice that something has changed .
mt : ni@@ kol@@ a tes@@ la died on the 7@@ th of janu@@ ary , 194@@ 3 .
i want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
and we then can re-@@ per@@ fu@@ se the li@@ ver with cells , pres@@ er@@ ving the blood ves@@ sel tree .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , this year &apos;s flu was rela@@ tively mi@@ ld .
although we want to avoid suffering , it seems we are running some@@ what towards it .
and when sur@@ fers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you &apos;ve never been out there , what are they doing ?
ue : it &apos;s a dream . it &apos;s a dream . yeah .
there &apos;s a lot of damage to the nest , and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess .
sum@@ mi@@ ze built a twitter search engine .
we were pil@@ ot@@ ed , i could say , by a highly auto@@ cra@@ tic stat@@ es@@ woman , but who also had an incredible passion for environment .
sa@@ mu@@ el &apos;s kids are in private school , and he &apos;s starting to help other farmers in the area also go into ar@@ te@@ mi@@ sia production -- di@@ gni@@ ty being more important than wealth .
and so there &apos;s a bar@@ code on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
the fact of the matter is that it just isn &apos;t true , and it &apos;s easy to think that it is true , but in order to see it in another way , in order to see that actually tex@@ ting is a mira@@ cul@@ ous thing , not just ener@@ ge@@ tic , but a mira@@ cul@@ ous thing , a kind of emergen@@ t complexity that we &apos;re seeing happening right now , we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is , in which case , one thing that we see is that tex@@ ting is not writing at all .
we need the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test from many different di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ines to come and join this eff@@ ort -- all ages , all different groups -- because this is the time , folks .
now you can just go on google . just look it up .
they were the same people that later went in to medical school , you know , because there was money in it , you know . i mean , later , then they all got into business -- i mean , there are waves of -- going into your high school , person saying , you want to be rich , you know , be a scientist . you know , not any@@ more .
she &apos;s going to spon@@ sor the prin@@ ting of this book in pa@@ per@@ back form .
and because we cannot do it on our own , we &apos;ve developed a very fan@@ cy auth@@ oring tool that any author , any par@@ ent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education , can use this auth@@ oring tool to develop similar apps on tab@@ lets without program@@ ming .
and that &apos;s true both for contin@@ ental areas like the u.s. or europe and for smaller areas em@@ bed@@ ded within a larger gri@@ d .
they &apos;re thinking about putting it on the insi@@ des of buildings to move water up without pump@@ s .
it &apos;s ligh@@ ter than an i@@ pad , it &apos;s a bit cheaper .
if you &apos;re in the comm@@ un@@ al industry , look at religion and do the comm@@ un@@ al bit .
and if you can , just scri@@ bble a pattern .
third point , very brie@@ fly . he talked a lot about freedom from fear .
on the back@@ side , it &apos;s much more human@@ e -- ent@@ ran@@ ce , din@@ ing hall , etc .
because it means that -- the way life can live out there , it has enormous advan@@ tages as compar@@ ed with living on a planet .
but they use their ta@@ ils a lot , especially in ru@@ t .
i &apos;ve been a civil ser@@ v@@ ant , and i &apos;ve been in charge of policy for this guy as well .
buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen and i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful that i &apos;ve gotten to do that here at ted .
i said , &quot; could i come and inter@@ view you in prison to find out it you &apos;re psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths ? &quot;
that &apos;s why , in the face of our re@@ gre@@ t , the thing we consi@@ st@@ ently say is , &quot; i could have ki@@ cked myself . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to try that right now .
so , state spon@@ sor of terror@@ ism , fe@@ ature of the cold war .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
it makes no sense , if you think about it .
what does environmental de@@ va@@ station actually look like ? at tedx@@ victori@@ a , photograph@@ er gar@@ th l@@ enz shares sho@@ cking photos of the al@@ ber@@ ta tar sands mining project -- and the beautiful ecosystems under threat . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
oh , man . um , yes .
ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreci@@ ate why a 10@@ -@@ foot po@@ le that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
paper ma@@ ps are becoming ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
this is going to be a piece called &quot; ap@@ ha@@ sia , &quot; and it &apos;s for hand gest@@ ures synchroni@@ zed to sound , and this invi@@ tes yet another role , and final one i &apos;ll share with you , which is that of the ch@@ ore@@ o@@ graph@@ er .
during his time at the american museum of natural history , andre@@ ws led a range of expedi@@ tions to un@@ char@@ ted regions , like here in the go@@ bi desert .
and here i want to remind you of a wonderful point that paul ma@@ c@@ cre@@ ad@@ y made at ted three years ago .
so the lamp is not just giving a light , it &apos;s also giving a dar@@ k@@ ness .
laptops , computers , tab@@ lets -- you name it , they have it .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
but the biggest neuro@@ logical tur@@ n@@ -@@ on for people is other people .
my wife , as i said , she grew up outside of boston .
i just looked at it , and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
and to change the game , you have to change the frame , the way we see things -- to change the frame from ho@@ sti@@ lity to hospi@@ t@@ ality , from terror@@ ism to touri@@ sm .
i sele@@ ct this one because it was 197@@ 3 , and it was a master plan for one of the can@@ ary islands .
and i have to tell you about my friend , len , to talk about why positive psych@@ ology is more than positive emotion , more than building pleasure .
and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
the fear has chil@@ led professional inter@@ action so thousands of tragic er@@ r@@ ors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up : &quot; are you sure that &apos;s the right do@@ sage ? &quot;
what do organized religions do ?
and that is why the message is that of gand@@ hi@@ an engineering .
the organized crime and corruption repor@@ ting project is sta@@ ff@@ ed by journali@@ sts and citizens where they are crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing what di@@ ct@@ ators and terrorists are doing with public fun@@ ds around the world , and , in a more dramatic case , we &apos;ve seen in mexi@@ co , a country that has been ra@@ cked by 50,000 nar@@ co@@ ti@@ c@@ s-@@ related mur@@ ders in the past six years .
the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals mi@@ gra@@ te down from the can@@ adi@@ an ar@@ c@@ tic to the g@@ ul@@ f of st. la@@ wr@@ ence in canada to engage in cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p , mat@@ ing and to have their pu@@ ps .
i hope you &apos;ll join me next time when i will be making an equ@@ ally scientific and fac@@ t-@@ based in@@ quir@@ y into the cost of alien music pi@@ ra@@ cy to he american economy .
lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .

fru@@ g@@ al digital is essentially a small research group at c@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ d .
one idea is to dra@@ stically reduce public support for the arts .
it &apos;s children &apos;s de@@ light , a teacher &apos;s en@@ vy , as they say .
so you can do it only with their trust .
consider the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ de ro@@ und@@ wor@@ m , the most ab@@ und@@ ant of all animals .

he was beg@@ ging by a bus stop a few years ago , got picked up and is now in an orph@@ an@@ age , has been coming to school for the last four and a half months .
one of the great mi@@ stakes , i think , of economi@@ cs is it fa@@ ils to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s reti@@ rement , un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , cost , is a function , not only of its amount , but also its meaning .
but then these same children den@@ y each other their full attention .
now this happens very fast , in the blin@@ k of an eye , so , together with l@@ g , we cap@@ tured this motion with a camera that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second .
we humans are invent@@ ing a new fire , not du@@ g from below , but flo@@ wing from above ; not sc@@ ar@@ ce , but bo@@ unti@@ ful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transi@@ ent , but per@@ man@@ ent ; not co@@ stly , but free .
and then , when we took addi@@ tional pictures , we discovered that from these fra@@ ctures are issu@@ ing je@@ ts of fine , i@@ cy particles exten@@ ding hundreds of miles into space .
and that &apos;s simply what i did .
but this is a pro@@ mis@@ ing era in the musli@@ m world .
he took my master fal@@ con pattern , he actually did lost wa@@ x casting in bron@@ ze for me , and this is the bron@@ ze i got back .
and each time i make public art , i want something that &apos;s really relevant to the place it &apos;s inst@@ all@@ ed .
in &quot; the des@@ cent of man , &quot; he wrote , &quot; in each great region of the world , the living mamm@@ als are closely related to the extin@@ ct species of the same region .
this system equ@@ ates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary .
this time &#91; i &apos;ll &#93; give you the entire picture that i saw in 2002 , and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in africa , think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this contin@@ ent .
so growing up , you know , i had a ca@@ ke and everything , but i never got any pres@@ ents , because , born two days after christmas .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
made in 19@@ 39 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grandparents .
it &apos;s completely silent and non@@ pollu@@ ting .
and of course , the baby bab@@ o@@ on was so inno@@ cent , it didn &apos;t turn and run .
the libr@@ ary of the free university , which open@@ ed last year , is an example of that .
ten thousand years ago , the humans and li@@ ve@@ stock and pe@@ ts were not even one t@@ ent@@ h of one percent and wouldn &apos;t even have been vi@@ sible on such a curve .

jen@@ ny is horri@@ fied at what she has done , but then the transl@@ ator explains that the patient &apos;s condi@@ tion has nothing to do with the operation .
and what i &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
the su@@ ri@@ mi sticks &#91; of &#93; cr@@ ab@@ meat , or is being sold as cra@@ b meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dy@@ ed with co@@ chin@@ e@@ al .

me@@ ds don &apos;t equal medical care .
re@@ u@@ ben mar@@ go@@ lin : sculp@@ ting waves in wood and time
i had to learn the language .
we had stories like &quot; the se@@ ven@@ -@@ lea@@ gue bo@@ ots &quot; : the giant who had these bo@@ ots , where , once you put them on , with every stri@@ de you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able to people without that kind of energy at their dis@@ posal .
obviously , being a technology magazine , technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about .
whether they support islami@@ sts or liber@@ als , eg@@ ypti@@ ans &apos; priori@@ ties for this government are identical , and they are jobs , st@@ ability and education , not moral poli@@ cing .
or is the whole design of the system wrong ?
so we formed cour@@ ser@@ a , whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instru@@ ctors at the best universi@@ ties and provide it to everyone around the world for free .
that &apos;s what emergen@@ ce means .
and i &apos;d also like to say that the ir@@ ony of course , is that den@@ ying girl , supp@@ res@@ sing girl , supp@@ res@@ sing emotion , re@@ f@@ using feeling has lead thus here .
you &apos;ve got the idea .
it &apos;s totally inti@@ mi@@ dat@@ ing .
so the an@@ nu@@ al death rate ad@@ ds up to 1@@ 50,000 -- sorry , the da@@ ily death rate -- 1@@ 50,000 people per day , which is a huge number by any standard .
because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call &quot; the big image . &quot;
so now we get to the exist@@ enti@@ al reality of the story , right ?
these are not glasses , these are empty fra@@ mes .
the village square was filled with hundreds of people .
now , unless you &apos;re a prison gu@@ ard , the sent@@ ence &quot; some jobs are ja@@ ils &quot; is literally fal@@ se .
now , i want to tell a story , which is a very famous story in the indian and budd@@ h@@ ist tradition , of the great sa@@ int as@@ ang@@ a who was a contemporary of au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine in the west and was sort of like the budd@@ h@@ ist au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine .
and when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disa@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third as@@ sumption : they know the truth , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es .
you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . &quot;
but he &apos;s an absolute geni@@ us when it comes to design .
so these are kind of some of the little challenges , you know , that we have to face .
the second is colum@@ bus finally gets funded to go to india , but he gets lost .
during the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i spent a lot of time in central america , which was eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by civil wars that stra@@ dd@@ led the ide@@ ological divi@@ de of the cold war .
simply because of this gigan@@ tic , mamm@@ oth machine called des@@ al@@ ination .
we don &apos;t know of any other house , &quot; and so forth and so on .
and this project started when the ja@@ i@@ pur foot organization , the largest fi@@ tter of prosthe@@ tic lim@@ bs in the world , came to the bay area and they said , &quot; we need a better kne@@ e . &quot;
so i &apos;m gon@@ na take you through what i think is a remarkable sequ@@ ence .
i decided , okay , i can cla@@ im the femin@@ ist lab@@ el .
so these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health .
on street cor@@ ners everywhere , people are looking at their cell phones , and it &apos;s easy to dis@@ miss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture .
and you see these reci@@ pes on the side ?
i don &apos;t know how they did it .
so beyond sp@@ ati@@ al memory , if we look for this gri@@ d-@@ like fir@@ ing pattern throughout the whole brain , we see it in a whole series of lo@@ cations which are always active when we do all kinds of auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal memory tas@@ ks , like re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing the last time you went to a we@@ dding , for example .
&quot; that is exactly right .
by that compar@@ is@@ on , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
and one fur@@ ther@@ more has the impul@@ se to gener@@ ali@@ ze , as much as possible , in defin@@ ing who that ene@@ my is .
nearly every year for more than a hundred years , it &apos;s looked like this in the summer .
you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times , or have different parts of the hardware doing different things .
plan b appeared in its first full-@@ blo@@ wn form in 199@@ 8 -- something called the digital mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um copyright act .
but even as mor@@ ality bin@@ ds people together into a unit , into a team , the cir@@ cl@@ ing blin@@ ds them .
as a pa@@ stor , i do see a lot of ko@@ o@@ ks .
and we wanted to use the water not only as a context , but as a pri@@ mary building material .
and one of the soldiers wrote home , and this is the sent@@ ence that he put : &quot; the stru@@ g@@ gle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather sever@@ e one . &quot;
so one of the pi@@ one@@ ers , for example , is dr. an@@ th@@ ony at@@ ala , and he has been working on la@@ y@@ ering cells to create body parts -- bla@@ d@@ ders , val@@ ves , kid@@ ne@@ ys .
i &apos;ve been to some of those continents , but africa was , in the words of steven pin@@ ker , was a blank s@@ late , largely .
and basically , the shape appe@@ ars largely because of a kind of a fir@@ st-@@ mo@@ ver advan@@ tage .
this is alex@@ ander le@@ bed , who was a general that worked with yel@@ t@@ sin , who talked about , and pres@@ ented to congress , this idea that the russi@@ ans had developed -- these su@@ it@@ case bom@@ bs . they were very low y@@ i@@ eld -- 0@@ .@@ 1 to one kil@@ ot@@ on , hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma was around 13 kil@@ ot@@ ons -- but enough to do an unbelie@@ vable amount of damage .
i think this is an extraordinary example of how curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty-@@ based research -- we just wondered how they clim@@ bed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine .
until recently , what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal &apos;s brain could do too , so we could study it in animal models .
and the rate at which the ar@@ c@@ tic sea ice is going away is a lot qui@@ cker than models .
and the brain then senses that there &apos;s an out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ body experience .
a wise person is like a ja@@ zz musi@@ cian -- using the notes on the page , but dan@@ cing around them , invent@@ ing combin@@ ations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .
-- le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da vin@@ c@@ i . and further , i should invi@@ te him to meet my ol@@ dest tru@@ ste@@ e , who had maj@@ ored in french history at yale some 7@@ 0-@@ odd years before and , at 8@@ 9 , still ru@@ led the world &apos;s largest priv@@ ately ow@@ ned texti@@ le empire with an ir@@ on hand .
and thir@@ dly , because of the rise of non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations .
it &apos;s awful .
when i was in da@@ vo@@ s , china &apos;s ma@@ yo@@ r of d@@ ali@@ an was pres@@ sed about their co2 strate@@ gy , and he said the following , &quot; you know , americans use seven times the co2 per capita as chinese . &quot;
and where they &apos;ve gone . so these are all post@@ graduate students .
the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a heal@@ th@@ care re@@ form de@@ ba@@ te , &quot; our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clini@@ cs , hospi@@ t@@ als and nur@@ sing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot;
and the ironi@@ c thing about it is that they are not sta@@ ving off the a@@ qu@@ atic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they &apos;ve all agre@@ ed on , and they love .
this is the main meth@@ od that i use . this is called functional mri .
we couldn &apos;t do them without technology .
it was part of the quality of life .
well you can see this on an mri .
so , does it work ? yes , it works -- to a certain point .
these are mill@@ en@@ ni@@ al structures -- por@@ tions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
and we said , &quot; he &apos;s five . &quot;
and you inspired an i@@ an m@@ ce@@ wan no@@ vel i think with that .
very simple stuff .
you can &apos;t talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets , and i again give je@@ ff@@ re@@ y sa@@ chs of harvard huge ku@@ do@@ s for bringing to the world this notion of his ra@@ ge -- for five dollars you can save a life .
we can make history .
when i arri@@ ved i didn &apos;t speak a word of french , and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
we also have se@@ ven@@ -@@ day execu@@ tive pro@@ grams .
why should new ideas be accep@@ ted ?
you know , my grandfather died many years ago when i was little , but his love for ma@@ e west lives on as a mis@@ sp@@ elling in the dna of his pro@@ gen@@ y .
they have cul@@ tiv@@ ated a brand of profession@@ ali@@ sm , business acu@@ men and innovation .
thank you very much .
in this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
a hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechani@@ cs of the car and how the i@@ gni@@ tion ti@@ ming worked and all sorts of things .
and so when ty@@ r@@ one talks about the fe@@ tu@@ s being tra@@ pped in a cont@@ am@@ inated environment , this is my cont@@ am@@ inated environment .
so what were these ancient -- i mean , they &apos;re ancient , they &apos;re foreign , but they &apos;re at the same time somehow familiar .
but it was also a slightly more or@@ tho@@ do@@ x india that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
that ev@@ ening , i came home to hundreds of hate mails , hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .
you picked a particular bre@@ ed , you learned some new information about the bre@@ ed .
richard ni@@ xon goes to represent the united states government at the celebra@@ tions for indepen@@ dence in ghana .
i don &apos;t deser@@ ve it . i don &apos;t deser@@ ve anything .
we argu@@ e about it every time we use it .
because the last 20 years , the som@@ al@@ i woman has stood up .
hun@@ t@@ ington &apos;s kit@@ chen . i work with a community .
now , this robot is currently our star robot .
but the conditions for compassion to be activ@@ ated , to be ar@@ ous@@ ed , are particular conditions .
the children who sc@@ ored highest on this &quot; do you know &quot; scale had the highest self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em and a greater sense they could control their lives .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
hy@@ -@@ wire is the world &apos;s first dri@@ vable fuel cell , and we have follo@@ wed up that now with sequ@@ el .
why ? because it is a qu@@ ant@@ um phenomenon . it &apos;s qu@@ ant@@ um physics .
now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it .
now , this was a my@@ ster@@ y in the new york times where the hon@@ ey was very red , and the new york state for@@ en@@ si@@ cs department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dy@@ e with that found in a mar@@ a@@ sch@@ in@@ o cher@@ ry factory down the street .
now there &apos;s ven@@ u@@ es like this , a disco@@ the@@ que , and there &apos;s ju@@ ke@@ boxes in b@@ ars , where you don &apos;t even need to have a band .
but for example , bi@@ kers , they have the same speed .
that is col@@ tan extra@@ ction , gold mining .
so , i wanted to show 2.@@ 3 million prison uni@@ forms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a ni@@ ck@@ el on its edge .
v@@ us@@ i mahl@@ as@@ ela : &quot; th@@ ul@@ a ma@@ ma &quot;
he came over to a piano that was there , and he bal@@ an@@ ced himself and began playing something like this .
and part of the reason i love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood , i notice they re@@ act completely differently .
and turned up the other way , the people who are reti@@ rement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boom@@ ers get to reti@@ rement age .
leadership matters . those men are following the orders of a super@@ ior offi@@ cer .
but can i just tell you , the little sign for a g@@ ents &apos; toilet or a la@@ dies &apos; toilet is determined by a tri@@ angle .
when it comes to choice , we have far more to ga@@ in than to lose by engaging in the many trans@@ lations of the nar@@ ra@@ tives .
and then it could help track that for you .
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo pan@@ or@@ ama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there .
and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- acci@@ d@@ ental , again -- it was an intui@@ tive kind of thing , and i just kept going with it , and made this pro@@ posal for a building , which was only a pro@@ posal .
basically , you don &apos;t have to necessarily buy brand new things . you have con@@ dem@@ ned computers that are stri@@ pped apart , and you can buy sal@@ va@@ ged components and things that you can reas@@ semble in a new con@@ figu@@ ration .
now , she was the master . this photo was taken in 194@@ 8 and she was already a cele@@ br@@ ated artist .
and i put them together , and you walk between them .
so i get two sources .
so , there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health .
the wor@@ ms are growing in@@ ches per week !
and by getting a good education , you too can control your own de@@ stin@@ y .
so the more radical the innovation , the more the un@@ certain@@ ty , the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for .
and i want to tell this little story about my own beginn@@ ings because it &apos;s very inter@@ related to happiness and ag@@ nes .
the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful , beautiful child , and i remember , as she was appro@@ aching me , the voices of friends saying , &quot; the moment they put the baby in your hands , you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is &#91; on &#93; an order of ma@@ gni@@ tude more powerful than anything you &apos;ve ever experienced in your entire life . &quot;
they &apos;re made from &quot; cre@@ ma@@ ins . &quot;
my mother was cla@@ im@@ ed by the war .
so you make yourself big , you stre@@ tch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
and here is what science knows .
so i decided that i would start to draw . how hard could that be ?
here &apos;s an example from a variety of con@@ tex@@ ts .
we can p@@ lot the plan@@ ari@@ ty of the surfaces , their cur@@ v@@ ature , how radi@@ al they are -- all information that may not be inst@@ antly vi@@ sible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can arti@@ cu@@ late , and that we can use to control the fol@@ ding .
but i think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
far more effective , i have to say , than anything i later learned in law school .
they have res@@ pite homes , the first , the first care cent@@ ers , the first coun@@ sel@@ ing services -- and not just in urban , 7@@ -@@ milli@@ on-@@ population ban@@ gal@@ ore , but in the har@@ dest to reach villa@@ ges in the state of kar@@ nat@@ ak@@ a .
so , variety is important . have you ever r@@ ented a video or a film that you &apos;ve already seen ? who &apos;s done this ? get a fu@@ cking life .
and so three months later , just before she returned to the united states , nur@@ ses in ac@@ cr@@ a go on strike .
i was a body sur@@ fer and i thought , &quot; wow , that was an incredible wa@@ ve ! &quot;
d@@ r : no , i don &apos;t think so .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
and they came down on the side of open publi@@ cation , which is the right approach -- we &apos;ve brie@@ f@@ ed the white house , we &apos;ve brie@@ f@@ ed members of congress , we &apos;ve tried to take and pus@@ h the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advan@@ ces .
for me personally , the most critical lesson of all is this : local com@@ mit@@ ment to peace is all@@ -@@ important , but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence .
in gand@@ o , there was no electricity , no access to clean drin@@ king water , and no school .
i call this hy@@ person@@ ic sound .
so today i &apos;m going to give you an example dra@@ wn from my pen@@ is study to show you how knowledge dra@@ wn from studies of one organ system provi@@ ded insi@@ ghts into a very different one .
but most bats are vor@@ aci@@ ous insect pre@@ dat@@ ors .
and it works like this -- this doesn &apos;t actually produce any sound .
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes , and speci@@ fi@@ cally by hor@@ mon@@ es .
this sch@@ ism has only gro@@ wn wi@@ der .
and you know what it makes me think of , is it &apos;s sort of s@@ nu@@ g and pu@@ ff@@ y ; it &apos;s like a du@@ v@@ et spread over a bed .
and what i wondered was whether they were being affe@@ cted by the name or the content of the color , so i decided to do a little experiment .
right ? it can happen in the stock market .
i even &#91; at &#93; that time was not speaking swa@@ hil@@ i .
david .
every day , we make decisions that have good or bad consequences for our future selves . daniel gold@@ stein makes tools that help us imagine ourselves over time , so that we make smart choices for future us .
so , bringing together the small to help faci@@ li@@ tate and create the big , i think , is something that we believe in -- something i believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at ide@@ o .
what we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on .
pm : thank you . b@@ v : thank you . thanks very much .
i thought , &quot; what &apos;s my mother &apos;s face going to look like on the day of my fun@@ er@@ al ? &quot;
most of the works have no title , unti@@ tled .
so there &apos;s a certain amount of super@@ fi@@ ci@@ ality in that data .
because , you know , we both come from families that really look up to hu@@ mi@@ lity and wisdom , but we both like to live larger than life .
we can write down all the la@@ ws of physics we know in one line .
this is a colle@@ ction of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
and if you move to the right you also get language , because that &apos;s abstra@@ cting even further from res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce , but still main@@ taining meaning .
and when you feed these kids bad food , that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . so that &apos;s really what this is all about .
this technology works by introdu@@ cing a mi@@ r@@ ror into the telescope opti@@ cs system that &apos;s continu@@ ously changing to counter@@ act what the atmosphere is doing to you .
he said i was thro@@ wing my life away if that &apos;s all i chose to do with it ; that i should go to college , i should become a professional person , that i had great potential and i was wa@@ sting my talent to do that . &quot;
and so it wasn &apos;t really a career .
and i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it uni@@ tes kind of di@@ spar@@ ate elements .
and if you &apos;re then interested in the history of a piece of dna , or the whole genome , you can re@@ constru@@ ct the history of the dna with those differences you obser@@ ve .
j@@ y : to better understand how this bio@@ degra@@ dation works , we wanted to veri@@ fy the cat@@ abo@@ lic path@@ ways of our three stra@@ ins .
we developed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on ht@@ m@@ l .
they recei@@ ve surgery the following day , and then they will stay for a day or two , and then they are put back on the bu@@ ses to be taken back to where they came from , and where their families will be waiting to take them back home .
and we went in , and right off the bat , our conversation really wasn &apos;t taking flight , but he was or@@ der@@ ing a lot of food .
this is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office .
and they said , &quot; well you can dig . &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of di@@ gging down .
we have , actually , a pretty good working definition of complexity .
i teach courses in physical computing and we@@ ar@@ able electronics .
now the trick with this is that i &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t speak mal@@ ag@@ asy .
this increase in life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy is the remarkable product of culture -- the cru@@ ci@@ ble that hol@@ ds science and technology and wi@@ de-@@ scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-@@ being .
so we had some good ideas : we took old automo@@ bi@@ le wind@@ shi@@ el@@ ds , put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whi@@ te@@ board .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continu@@ ous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can be@@ have like a continu@@ ous fluid .
we &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
but i -- i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
yet , i have nothing that i would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency , especially a foreign intelligence agency .
so what we ad@@ ded is a second element to our network , which is a battery swa@@ p system .
ro@@ cky planets like our earth are signific@@ antly more complex than stars because they con@@ tain a much greater diversity of materials .
giving people less control might be a wonderful way to coun@@ ter the ab@@ un@@ dance of choice and make them happ@@ i@@ er .
let &apos;s prevent the tasmani@@ an devi@@ l from being the first animal to go extin@@ ct from cancer .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thro@@ wn away .
you had separ@@ ated functions , increasingly .
we actually view it as a baby step in terms of , it &apos;s taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level .
this is a ko@@ hl@@ er sho@@ wer , a wat@@ er@@ fall sho@@ wer , and actually , all those kno@@ bs bene@@ ath are also sho@@ wer@@ heads .
or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here ?
it cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
i am an hon@@ ors but go home with regular students who are soldiers in terri@@ tory that ow@@ ns them .
so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priori@@ ties straight .
and they &apos;re tiny . they &apos;re the thi@@ ck@@ ness of a hair .
now , if you want to understand what happened then when the continents bro@@ ke apart , and dinosau@@ rs found -- land@@ lu@@ b@@ bers , as they are -- found themselves ad@@ ri@@ ft . there &apos;s some missing puzzle pieces .
because this is where we are .
you might be surpri@@ sed to know that most people in the g@@ ul@@ f who are leading these cultural initi@@ ati@@ ves happen to be women .
so by now i was walking the lob@@ by , and of course , that hur@@ t , because of my hi@@ p , and i kind of needed a sign .
there is one particular quote -- a les@@ oth@@ o chi@@ ef once said that &quot; here in les@@ oth@@ o , we &apos;ve got two problems : rats and the government . &quot;
if the sales person says , &quot; wait a second .
but the process itself is without purpose , without for@@ esi@@ ght , without design .
do you ri@@ p it off quickly -- short du@@ ration but high inten@@ sity -- or do you take your band@@ -@@ aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as pain@@ ful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re interested in looking at in my lab .
a@@ v : well , i &apos;m gla@@ d ruf@@ us is bringing this up , because you can notice where he di@@ ps in the first years where i think i was doing most of the work .
most of you are familiar with por@@ to@@ b@@ ello mush@@ rooms .
in particular , one person had put it forward .
this is thomas de@@ mar@@ se at the university of florida .
and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about .
a few free@@ ze@@ -@@ dri@@ ed me@@ als , but mostly i try and eat much more un@@ process@@ ed fo@@ ods .
well the answer is the science of radio astron@@ omy .
he allowed facebook , a u.s.@@ -@@ based service , to continue to stay on inside of t@@ uni@@ sia .
so i went off to the states , as many people do if they &apos;re going to do research , and i spent a few years in pi@@ ttsburgh . this is pi@@ ttsburgh .
and so they did .
video text : &quot; from con@@ ception to birth &quot; o@@ o@@ cy@@ te sper@@ m eg@@ g inse@@ min@@ ated 24 hours : baby &apos;s first di@@ vision the fertili@@ zed o@@ v@@ um divi@@ des a few hours after fu@@ sion ...
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
the challenge i have is how to do that .
so i &apos;m really a basic scientist , not a clini@@ cian , but in the last year and a half i &apos;ve started to switch over , to use what we &apos;ve been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthe@@ tic devi@@ ces , and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
well , if you try to ti@@ le it , it doesn &apos;t work too well , does it .
re@@ bec@@ ca ma@@ ck@@ inn@@ on : so the underlying message of this video rema@@ ins very powerful even today .
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallu@@ c@@ ination .
and the de@@ fen@@ se minister -- she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and air force and so forth .
so , we &apos;re really fascin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
we &apos;re fac@@ ing very tough challenges .
and i said , &quot; look , i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them , to see if you appro@@ ve of them .
and str@@ angel@@ y enough , the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast au@@ g@@ ment@@ ation is li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction , and most of that is being done by men .
if you &apos;re wondering why , i &apos;ll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
it &apos;s when the internet combin@@ es with these kinds of passionate pro-@@ am con@@ sum@@ ers -- who are knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able ; they &apos;ve got the in@@ cen@@ tive to inno@@ v@@ ate ; they &apos;ve got the tools ; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collabor@@ ation .
and i &apos;m going to create this in two years , and i have .
as you ad@@ just , you pun@@ ch it up , and then when i would do that , it was thro@@ wing my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der this way , which as i was doing it , i was like , &quot; oh wow , that &apos;s beg@@ ging for a 3@@ 60 flip , &quot; because that &apos;s how you load up for a 3@@ 60 flip .
so , i thought , maybe i &apos;ll do this for the next tw@@ enty years or something .
in the general ele@@ ction , it &apos;s the citizens who get to vote , if you &apos;re over 18 , in some states if you have an id .
this is serious business . this ain &apos;t no fun .
our ri@@ b@@ bon is a ha@@ ir@@ y ri@@ b@@ bon .
as i expla@@ ined earlier , plants extra@@ ct phosphorus from the soil , through water .
and i can see that something else died there in the b@@ loo@@ dy mu@@ d and was bu@@ ried in the bli@@ zz@@ ard : a people &apos;s dream died there , and it was a beautiful dream . &quot;
i learned that it was against the law in ken@@ ya .
and it &apos;s in@@ fl@@ ated twice a year for one month at a time .
and 1957 -- the united states had the same economy as chi@@ le has today .
i have my clients . i am doing my work like i always did .
a couple of bud@@ dies of mine and i had finished a 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ -@@ day run across the entire sahar@@ a desert .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back sh@@ ell , and we &apos;re now in fre@@ e-@@ fall .
there &apos;s a very simple institu@@ tional technology which can transform that , and it &apos;s called veri@@ fied au@@ ctions .
we set them off on this air ho@@ ck@@ ey table .
the i@@ con of i@@ con@@ s finally has a face .
it &apos;s better than a computer .
it all beg@@ ins with empathy .
the ance@@ stor of the apes stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the pla@@ in .
so we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would , and say , &quot; how can we do better ? &quot;
it &apos;s ti@@ tled &quot; the culture of organs . &quot;
and that de@@ ple@@ tes oxygen , and it builds up co2 in your blood . so , i learned never to move .
but i &apos;m going to end by wi@@ den@@ ing the lens to the entire region to look at the mun@@ dan@@ e t@@ opi@@ cs of ar@@ ab views of religion and politics and how this imp@@ acts women , reve@@ aling some surpri@@ ses along the way .
what &apos;s un@@ expected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong mag@@ net .
this is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .
so we have this sound .
when we act together , the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts .
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 4@@ 9 c@@ ents -- that &apos;s what the government allo@@ c@@ ates for l@@ unch .
and then what happened ?
and yes , that means cat@@ ching all of those mis@@ eri@@ es and hur@@ t , but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , i &apos;m ready to catch them .
low-@@ income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lot@@ ter@@ ies .
when i laun@@ ched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second .
the high degre@@ e of inter@@ conne@@ ctivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant syste@@ mic risk to the global economy and we could easily re@@ produce the tn@@ c network with a few simple rules .
so , that &apos;s for bed nets . so you will think , &quot; that &apos;s great .
but i &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as mar@@ vel@@ ous -- your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is .
and home , we know , is not just the place where you happen to be born .
they are co@@ ated . these fra@@ ctures are co@@ ated with organic materials .
well , i have a big anno@@ un@@ c@@ ement to make today , and i &apos;m really excited about this .
and in this universe there &apos;s nothing fix@@ ed and absolute . z@@ il@@ ch , ok .
are we dre@@ aming ? is this real ? it actually is real .
of course , you could bet they have done the most stupid thing : they ar@@ rested the bar@@ re@@ l . and now the picture of the sm@@ ash@@ ed face on the bar@@ re@@ l with the poli@@ ce@@ man dra@@ gging them to the police car , that was the best day for the photo@@ gra@@ pher@@ s from new@@ spa@@ pers that they ever will have .
so what happens when you put these things together ?
we actually created an artifi@@ cial sch@@ ism between cre@@ ation and execu@@ tion , as if you could actually create without knowing how to ex@@ ec@@ ute and as if you could actually ex@@ ec@@ ute without knowing how to create .
i wish i was that coordin@@ ated .
i &apos;m going to talk about post-@@ conflict re@@ co@@ very and how we might do post-@@ conflict re@@ co@@ very better .
they wear bright colors , ro@@ se and blue , like eastern dres@@ s . &quot;
so the question is , what fra@@ ction of these planets are actually su@@ it@@ able for life ?
buy it .
but if ru@@ be gold@@ berg machines and video poe@@ try aren &apos;t quite your c@@ up of tea , how about this .
either god is responsible for the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i , or god is not in control .
now for me , task shi@@ fting is an idea with truly global signifi@@ can@@ ce , because even though it has ari@@ sen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries , i think it has a lot of signifi@@ can@@ ce for bet@@ ter-@@ resour@@ ced countries as well . why is that ?
and what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories , and they sell their lo@@ g@@ gia or roof rights , and someone else builds on top of their building , and then that person s@@ ells the roof rights , and someone else builds on top of their building .
ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z : will our kids be a different species ?
so we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another cop@@ y of all of this and we actually put it back in the libr@@ ary of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a .
and it has a very nice ac@@ ute proper@@ ty .
there are 200 countries in the world . we like to think of the internet as a global village .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossi@@ ls , the baby fossi@@ ls , were missing .
the reason why that &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able is , when your grandparents were given social security , they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 6@@ 8 .
we cut cu@@ st@@ oms du@@ ties , we redu@@ ced im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the multina@@ tion@@ als coming in , with multina@@ tional budgets , who looked at per@@ -@@ capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian .
now the back@@ ground is -- the guy who did this is a physi@@ cist .
there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of syn@@ c with the culture of schools today .
what makes places like the tor@@ re david particularly remarkable is this sort of skel@@ eton fra@@ me@@ work where people can have a foundation where they can ta@@ p into .
works like this were hung in bas@@ el while i was p@@ uni@@ shed and stood in front of the pal@@ ace with my dra@@ wing in my mouth .
the complex things get more fragi@@ le , more vulnerable ; the gol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks conditions get more str@@ in@@ gen@@ t , and it &apos;s more difficult to create complexity .
i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find .
and we need to re@@ think our development strategi@@ es , so that we &apos;re not pro@@ mot@@ ing educational campaig@@ ns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
they develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not appro@@ ve of necessarily .
but don &apos;t take my word for it .
michael di@@ ck@@ in@@ son : how a fly flies
are we the victims of a mass del@@ u@@ sion ?
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , ex@@ cell@@ ent .
now a lot of us in the audience here live in the mid@@ west .
it simul@@ ates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment p@@ an out .
art can create an analo@@ gy .
so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-@@ bio@@ tic planet , because it &apos;s so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material , and therefore life could have evolved on it .
and they said , &quot; choose something reali@@ stic . &quot;
between them , these new revenue flo@@ ws d@@ warf aid .
they are taking responsibility .
and another par@@ ent said , &quot; i feel as if i &apos;ve played a role in an execu@@ tion . &quot;
he took 20,000 and then 6@@ 0,000 disa@@ g@@ gre@@ g@@ ated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip .
what i want instead , is for you to be whole , in@@ t@@ act , and functional enough to go out and save the world , after you &apos;ve decided you need to do it .
and you can basically see that the ri@@ cher a country is , the older the people are within it .
and we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that eth@@ ic ... &quot;

now da@@ mi@@ en knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
i would do birthday par@@ ties , we@@ dd@@ ings , di@@ vor@@ ces , anything for anyone who wanted to use my services .
that &apos;s an amazing thing .
one of the things that defin@@ es a ted@@ ster is you &apos;ve taken your passion , and you &apos;ve turned it into ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship .
&quot; dan , i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready . &quot;
to re@@ boo@@ t and make real tan@@ gi@@ ble change , real change , so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say , &quot; in 10 years time , the history of your children &apos;s lives , happiness -- and let &apos;s not forget , you &apos;re clever if you eat well , you know you &apos;re going to live longer -- all of that stuff , it will look different . ok ? &quot;
20 percent are getting treated .
woman 1 : yes .
and all the se@@ di@@ ment is then put through these scre@@ ens , and where we go again through it very carefully , looking for small b@@ one fra@@ g@@ ments , and it &apos;s then wash@@ ed .
fortunately , our leaders in washington at nasa head@@ quar@@ ters knew better and we began a very exten@@ sive study of the red planet .
now let &apos;s go over to india .
and indeed , they would say , &quot; all day . all night . i can never stop thinking about him or her . &quot;
it &apos;s to culture that we should look for gui@@ dance , for con@@ sol@@ ation , for mor@@ ality .
since september the 1@@ 1@@ th , when my work on islam suddenly prop@@ elled me into public life , in a way that i &apos;d never imag@@ ined , i &apos;ve been able to sort of go all over the world , and finding , everywhere i go , a ye@@ ar@@ ning for change .
in principle , you make those trees into biological photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic cells .
and we &apos;re going to do things like elimin@@ ate re@@ stri@@ ctions .
so he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against co@@ y@@ ot@@ es and other pre@@ dat@@ ors .
this is a book of cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , and i &apos;ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth .
other people are cl@@ inging to a piece of dri@@ ft@@ wood .
i &apos;ve started ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing my memory to the digital world , you know ? but that comes with a problem .
the re@@ actor will ser@@ ve to fertili@@ ze the environment , deli@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ dding approach .
it just simply can &apos;t be done , and bon@@ nie said to me , &quot; but if you &apos;re going to take the journey , i &apos;m going to see you through to the end of it , so i &apos;ll be there . &quot;
this was &quot; plan@@ ning &quot; -- in quot@@ es -- that did not have our best interests in mind .
everyone bur@@ st into laugh@@ ter . i was hu@@ mili@@ ated .
conne@@ cting them together through con@@ fer@@ ences -- like a ted -- br@@ ings so many powerful connections , or through the world for@@ um on social entrepreneur@@ ship that my foundation does at oxford every year .

right ? so , effectively , we ended up with a 3d dat@@ ab@@ ase of everything bra@@ d pi@@ tt &apos;s face is capable of doing .
you may teach them whatever cre@@ ed you think is most important , but i say you have a responsibility to let them be in@@ formed about all the other cre@@ e@@ ds in the world , too .
interviewer : no . if you try and put one foot in front of another , it &apos;s moving your feet away from under you . am : yes .
they can save lives because this stuff can ab@@ sor@@ b up to 12 times as much cr@@ ash energy per po@@ und as steel .
so if life could be establi@@ shed out there , it would have all the essen@@ ti@@ als -- chemistry and sun@@ light -- everything that &apos;s needed .
then we have our bu@@ d light guy who &apos;s the happy cou@@ ch po@@ ta@@ to .
and by the way , mi@@ stru@@ st was always very important for democracy .
the first consider@@ ation , make it clear , simple and un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous .
thank you very much .
so , ur@@ ani@@ um , which is very big , wants to spli@@ t .
and in paris , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c released its study con@@ fir@@ ming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
so , for all these reasons , i think we need better materials , and there are three key principles we can use to gui@@ de these materials .
tell them what you think i mean when i talk about mo@@ ves to pro@@ ve . i &apos;ve talk about -- i think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the con@@ cre@@ te reality of it .
what had happened was another se@@ al had s@@ nu@@ ck in behind me , and she did that to threat disp@@ lay .
it &apos;s like visual illu@@ sions , in which understanding them does not make them go away .
she &apos;s being ba@@ pti@@ zed .
i want to just cut this short . we did this over and over again .
but let me end with something i think much more important -- much more important than business .
this is un@@ heard of , both for us the publi@@ sher , and the author .
but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he &apos;s about to solve this problem .
do i want to walk in , because unless i have ari@@ ad@@ ne &apos;s thre@@ ad to an@@ ch@@ or -- enough metaph@@ ors for you ? -- somewhere , i may not get out .
so wei@@ bo , the 300 million public sphere , became a very good , conveni@@ ent tool for a political fight .
we establi@@ shed a green tax , and then everybody accep@@ ted it and all busin@@ ess@@ men paid it regul@@ arly .
i read that new york city was the first mega@@ -@@ city , a city of 10 million people or more , in 1950 .
but of course , what you said , i think the key to saving the world , the key to compassion is that it is more fun .
metaphor matters because it op@@ ens the door to discovery .
now , in order to harv@@ est it -- i mean , what &apos;s harv@@ est@@ ing ?
my mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
who are these people ?
our work &apos;s always had a focus on health . that &apos;s the key .
so that &apos;s this kind of re@@ cur@@ sive obser@@ vation system .
we all want it . most people sett@@ le for connection because love &apos;s too sc@@ ary . don &apos;t want to get hur@@ t .
thank you very much .
and i say that sin@@ cer@@ ely , par@@ tly because -- -- i need that !
we cam@@ ped over@@ night in the trees , in tree bo@@ ats .
so i decided to do work with clouds .
there &apos;s six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
these are all basically port@@ als into that one machine .
i say , &quot; time out . stop . &quot;
i &apos;ve been a huge fan of enter@@ prise and entrepreneur@@ ship since 199@@ 3 .
what does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
is just one way of looking at ethi@@ cs .
i think that if you can in@@ still some interest in science and how it works , well , that &apos;s a pa@@ yo@@ ff beyond easy measure . thank you very much .
thank you very much .
cu@@ z , like , as a hi@@ p ho@@ p thing , you know what i &apos;m say &apos;@@ n , ted be rock &apos;@@ n -- you know what i &apos;m say &apos;@@ n .
and i tell you what , it like everybody &apos;s got a story .
we have a bit of a love / hate thing going on .
and the consequ@@ ence is that many highly tal@@ ented , brilliant , creative people think they &apos;re not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn &apos;t valu@@ ed , or was actually sti@@ g@@ mati@@ zed .
what &apos;s going on here ?
now , when someone makes a b@@ old and bizar@@ re idea , sometimes that &apos;s all it is -- b@@ old and bizar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us .
i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there .
they were working on the third floor .
but that &apos;s the clo@@ sest appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tion i can have to it .
the first quote is from je@@ an-@@ cl@@ au@@ de tri@@ ch@@ et when he was gover@@ nor of the european central bank .
z@@ ambi@@ a-@@ born film@@ ma@@ ker franc@@ o sa@@ c@@ chi t@@ ours us through nollywood , nigeria &apos;s boom@@ ing film industry . gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ a film@@ making and brilli@@ ance under pressure from cre@@ ws that can shoot a full-@@ length fe@@ ature in a week .
it can get in the way of our desire to really be mean@@ ing@@ ful and useful in another person &apos;s life and , in short to love .
now , here &apos;s another example .
my lost year was my ju@@ bi@@ lee year .
and along the way i &apos;ve started noti@@ cing -- i &apos;m on my third generation of kids -- that they &apos;re getting bigger .
and it &apos;s in a piece of land that &apos;s this site .
and they &apos;ve been un@@ in@@ habi@@ ted for most of time because even in the ancient days , these islands were too far away from the bright lights of fi@@ j@@ i and ha@@ wai@@ i and ta@@ hit@@ i for those ancient pol@@ y@@ ne@@ si@@ an mar@@ in@@ ers that were tra@@ ver@@ sing the pac@@ i@@ fic so wid@@ ely .
they would say , look , these tests were designed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their e@@ ye@@ sight was , whether they had control of their we@@ apo@@ n .
because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
so in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they ad@@ ored , a living person they ad@@ ored .
a recent study by the world bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
one , it &apos;s a very attra@@ ctive planet -- it just has the beauty of the r@@ ings and so on .
we had all sorts of help from all wal@@ ks of life .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazi@@ l .
so we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habi@@ tat@@ s degra@@ des the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate , or are not able to perform critical functions .
but it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and ma@@ je@@ sty of satur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a tiny , fa@@ int blo@@ b just han@@ ging underneath one of the r@@ ings .
and then he ph@@ oned me .
well this one is@@ p in pakistan chose to effe@@ ctu@@ ate the block for its sub@@ scri@@ bers in a rather unusual way .
that is 500 times the power of the 7@@ .@@ 0 that hit port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ prin@@ ce -- 500 times the power , yet only under a thousand cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties .
because under this scen@@ ari@@ o , we walk further and further away from the current climate .
and of course , we were stun@@ ned for a while , but when we managed to get our wi@@ ts about us , we looked at it and said , &quot; my go@@ sh , what &apos;s going to happen with that little cu@@ b ?
now i thought that it was because i have this totally comp@@ elling hel@@ met cru@@ sa@@ de , right , this epi@@ ph@@ any of tom &apos;s .
it &apos;s incredible .
and co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ches , as anyone who &apos;s tried to get rid of them knows , have become really imm@@ une to the po@@ is@@ ons that we &apos;re using .
what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fiel@@ ds , but in terms of the entire food network .
here are a few quot@@ es indi@@ cating that : &quot; man has no nature , &quot; from the histori@@ an jo@@ se or@@ te@@ ga y gas@@ set ; &quot; man has no instin@@ cts , &quot; from the anthropolo@@ gist ash@@ ley mon@@ tag@@ u ; &quot; the human brain is capable of a full range of behavi@@ ors and pre@@ dis@@ posed to none , &quot; from the late scientist stephen ja@@ y g@@ ould .
so you start seeing here that the a@@ esthe@@ tics that are so important to a museum colle@@ ction like mom@@ a &apos;s are kept alive also by the sele@@ ction of these games .
in fact , even sh@@ enz@@ hen , the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people , and today it bo@@ a@@ sts about 10 to 11 million .
now if you have trouble main@@ taining your diet , it might help to have some extra ima@@ gery to remind you how many cal@@ ories are going to be coming at you .
and during my ph@@ .@@ d , i wanted to know exactly what chemi@@ c@@ als from our skin mosquitos used , african malari@@ al mosquitos use to track us down at night .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy appli@@ ed to people .
s@@ j : and that &apos;s me over there , taking photos the whole way .
one of the lines of encoura@@ gement that i heard over and over was , &quot; the streets of hollywood are li@@ tter@@ ed with the car@@ cas@@ ses of people like you , who think you &apos;re going to come to this town and make movi@@ es . &quot;
what is the point ? &quot;
you have pal@@ est@@ in@@ e-@@ lo@@ ves@@ -@@ israel .
wh@@ ere@@ as on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people paid a lot more attention to her inno@@ cent belief , and said she deser@@ ved a lot less bl@@ ame for caus@@ ing the accident .
so clearly , apo@@ cal@@ ypti@@ call@@ y-@@ minded auth@@ ors have over@@ st@@ ated the case .
in@@ ca sculp@@ tur@@ es are re@@ gar@@ ded as tre@@ as@@ ures in british muse@@ ums , while shakespeare is transl@@ ated into every major language of the earth .
since this was a high-@@ risk lo@@ cation , the police had war@@ ned the resi@@ dents , and no one was there when the water ro@@ se .
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
thank you .
what if we could do that ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fiel@@ ds around the world every single year .
why have we got 13@@ 0,000 tro@@ ops on the ground ?
ed : all right . well , i guess we &apos;ll double check it when i come in .
and , by the way , the chinese prime minister rei@@ ter@@ ated this at da@@ vo@@ s last sun@@ day .
how was the bible written ?
and here &apos;s the we@@ apo@@ n , it seems , that it did so over the last 500 million years .
that &apos;s one of the reasons why they &apos;re having such trouble today , and why ro@@ y disney is out to get michael eis@@ ner .
you stop , you &apos;ve got to figure it out .
and it might true that just the m@@ ere act of thinking can change your connect@@ ome -- an idea that you may find em@@ power@@ ing .
i would say it probably meas@@ ures ...
i would just like to add a cr@@ ass commercial -- i have a kids &apos; book coming out in the fall called &quot; mar@@ vel sandwi@@ ches , &quot; a com@@ pendi@@ um of all the serious play that ever was , and it &apos;s going to be available in fine book@@ stores , cru@@ m@@ my book@@ stores , tables on the street in oc@@ tober .
and that &apos;s design that matters .
first , i &apos;m going to try to give you a different perspective of genomi@@ cs .
and we started talking , and he said -- i told him what i was doing , and i told him rather grand@@ ly i was going to establi@@ sh independent diplomat in new york .
they &apos;re all big .
it re@@ quir@@ es that everyone treat choice as a private and self-@@ defin@@ ing act .
the best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspe@@ cts of life that we need to embra@@ ce in order for our own creativity to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh .
so the idea was to take these 6@@ 6@@ ,000 see@@ ds that they agre@@ ed to give us , and to take each seed and tra@@ p it in this preci@@ ous op@@ tical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind .
now this is being au@@ g@@ mented with further la@@ yers of technology like au@@ g@@ mented reality .
and maybe by 2020 , you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
we are losing our listening .
don &apos;t over@@ do it . &quot;
but the current ent@@ r@@ y-@@ level cars in compar@@ is@@ on to that is eight percent less , but 21 percent more inside space .
un@@ like other care@@ gi@@ vers , grandparents don &apos;t qu@@ it their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby .
one of the reasons why we &apos;re moving away from ban@@ qu@@ eting hall@@ s such as the one in which we stand , ban@@ qu@@ eting hall@@ s with extraordinary images on the cei@@ ling of k@@ ings en@@ thr@@ oned , the entire dra@@ ma played out here on this space , where the king of england had his head lo@@ pped off , why we &apos;ve moved from spaces like this , thr@@ ones like that , towards the town hall , is we &apos;re moving more and more towards the energi@@ es of our people , and we need to ta@@ p that .
the only ligh@@ ting in that area had to come from artifi@@ cial sources , and that &apos;s where i go out and i do the actual re@@ construction of the scene with ph@@ ot@@ ome@@ ters , with various meas@@ ures of illu@@ min@@ ation and various other meas@@ ures of color per@@ ception , along with special cameras and high-@@ speed film , right ?
i &apos;d like to tell you that it &apos;s also for self-@@ knowledge .
all that costs money .
and it &apos;s worth probably about three ma@@ c@@ book pro@@ s .
did you notice this se@@ ction is fore@@ play ?
it &apos;s ab@@ normal to get re@@ habi@@ li@@ t@@ ated .
the dna is organized in words , call them : genes and chromosom@@ es .
so i thought , you know what , i &apos;m going to start with connection .
oh , i know when your gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s really pi@@ s@@ sed off , even though she appe@@ ars to give you what you want .
i &apos;m currently a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . student at mit , and i absolutely understand the importance of deta@@ iled , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we &apos;re trying to teach 13@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
this a photograph of the des@@ k@@ top of a student of mine .
we then ask them , &quot; how powerful do you feel ? &quot; on a series of i@@ te@@ ms , and then we give them an opportunity to gam@@ ble , and then we take another s@@ ali@@ v@@ a sample .
after that , it had to be kne@@ aded . it had to then go in , kind of , a man@@ gle .
let &apos;s have a look at that .
they carry over 60 million simul@@ tane@@ ous voice conver@@ sations , and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very appar@@ ent vulner@@ ability .
we make these tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s again and again , multiple times a day .
i don &apos;t think it does . i think it &apos;s already part of a euro@@ -@@ turk@@ ish super@@ power .
the industry is 15 years old .
let &apos;s start with those of you who object , who would rule it out even before trying .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is enti@@ tled to make that choice .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual ini@@ tial strike , or bre@@ ath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wi@@ shed i &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arri@@ ving last night .
the difference is in@@ tent .
you can see they &apos;re very blas@@ é and kind of eff@@ or@@ t@@ less .
because until we convin@@ ce congress that the way to deal with copyright viol@@ ation is the way copyright viol@@ ation was de@@ alt with with nap@@ ster , with youtube , which is to have a trial with all the present@@ ation of evidence and the has@@ hing out of facts and the as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of re@@ me@@ dies that goes on in democra@@ tic societies .
so what are we going to do about that ?
it &apos;s not a dinosau@@ r ; it &apos;s a whale , animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean .
all right , i &apos;m going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the sk@@ ep@@ tics is a non@@ profit educational organization .
we &apos;re working with our physi@@ cist colleagues that have given us the mathemati@@ cal calcu@@ lations of the n@@ -@@ dimensional sch@@ rö@@ d@@ inger equation in time .
and then , in the middle of a sent@@ ence , at the very birth of twi@@ light , i turned and looked down the street .
and it &apos;s when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants , that they start to re@@ produce .
i said , &quot; hi , h@@ es@@ a . &quot; and he said , &quot; hi . &quot; i said , &quot; happy new year . &quot;
this is andrew ar@@ cher .
yes , great . i see people going down like this .
there was an age in the age of em@@ pi@@ res when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
we are a small fishing tribe situ@@ ated on the sou@@ the@@ a@@ stern ti@@ p of long island near the town of south@@ am@@ pt@@ on in new york .
and his life -- the transformation of his life from de@@ pri@@ vation and what one would expect -- poten@@ tially prison or death -- he become a lingu@@ ist , a trainer for the 7@@ 6@@ ers and now is a moti@@ va@@ tional speaker .
they didn &apos;t tri@@ ple their sales with ad@@ verti@@ sing ; they tri@@ pl@@ ed it by doing something remarkable .
well that &apos;s great . they gra@@ ze , they de@@ f@@ end each other , they work together , they generate wealth .
i mean , do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder , gent@@ ler philosop@@ h@@ y of work with a successful economy ?
number two : a de@@ clin@@ ing population means sc@@ ar@@ ce labor .

which is , of course , our old friend , the &quot; don &apos;t rock the bo@@ at &quot; argument .

over the next few days to a week , there will be a radiation cloud , again , going with the wind , and sett@@ ling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case , over long island .
students may disp@@ lay cap@@ tions in their native language .
that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe . the interesting thing is , these games requi@@ re that you have a lot of cognitive appar@@ at@@ us on line .
and this is the scene that gre@@ ets you in mc@@ mur@@ do .
that &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
and as a matter of fact , it &apos;s better not to know anything , because if you know too much , you &apos;re sty@@ mi@@ ed .

so this is the shot . that &apos;s a little video of what you &apos;re looking at there , which is our little test , so that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing , and i thought it was sort of an interesting thing , because it was , part of the hom@@ age of the movie itself is coming up with this sort of geni@@ us trick which i can &apos;t take credit for .
so she did that for two more months .
and that was the mission that we came up with .
and so the present self can tro@@ un@@ ce all over its dre@@ ams .
i gradu@@ ated from graduate school in 2006 , and i got a fel@@ lo@@ w@@ ship to go back to europe .
and i would pro@@ pose , with the better lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty that women have overall , that women probably should theore@@ ti@@ cally do better , if we could just get treated .
mo : we &apos;re re@@ com@@ men@@ ding to our clients a buy and hold strate@@ gy .
it &apos;s about how our brain is tri@@ cked into seeing a persi@@ st@@ ence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — s@@ as@@ ha bar@@ on co@@ hen is a very clever , very smart guy , com@@ edi@@ an , wanted to basically do an hom@@ age to the kind of the bu@@ ster ke@@ at@@ on sort of s@@ lap@@ stick things , and he wanted his leg bra@@ ce to get caught on a moving train .
there &apos;s a my@@ th@@ ology in india about -- where they say , and i &apos;ll say it in hin@@ di , &#91; hin@@ di &#93; right . what does that mean ?
it could change the way that we die , but more importantly , it could transform the way that we live .
but you get too many sti@@ t@@ ches on the nee@@ d@@ le . so she quickly realized cro@@ ch@@ et was the better thing .
so o@@ din was docum@@ ented every single day .
but there are companies .
an african economy can be broken up into three se@@ ctors .
and he expla@@ ined to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on spre@@ es in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an at@@ m here , $ 3@@ 0,000 from an at@@ m there , using cl@@ oned credit car@@ ds .
&quot; i feel r@@ ough now , and i probably ga@@ ined 100,000 pounds , but it was worth it . &quot;
there &apos;s gu@@ il@@ t about our treatment of native peop@@ les in modern intellectu@@ al life , and an un@@ will@@ ing@@ ness to ac@@ knowledge there could be anything good about western culture .
no@@ bel prize nom@@ ine@@ e her@@ n@@ and@@ o de so@@ to recogni@@ zed that the key to economic li@@ f@@ to@@ ff for most developing countries is to ta@@ p the vast amo@@ un@@ ts of un@@ capi@@ tali@@ zed land .
we need stories that have different kinds of hero@@ es willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that con@@ front re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness head on , that put the pre@@ cau@@ tion@@ ary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get ar@@ rested , blo@@ cking dir@@ ty power plants or fighting moun@@ tain@@ top-@@ re@@ mov@@ al coal mining .
you could sit at the bottom of your po@@ ol for four hours -- so , &quot; hon@@ ey , i &apos;m in the po@@ ol , &quot; will take on a whole new meaning .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you li@@ ft the adult inter@@ vention .
my ac@@ cent with english improved a lot .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
how do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
it &apos;s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well .
because where we have a sur@@ plus of technology in the cyber@@ security industry , we have a defini@@ te lack of -- call me ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned -- human intelligence .
all right . now , the idea for doing this , it wasn &apos;t very old at the time that i made that photo .
i &apos;m not going political on you but ... and so , i go to my mother &apos;s .
but the tasmani@@ an devi@@ l population has been under@@ going a really extremely fast decline .
and by the way , this is not a de@@ ba@@ te that we &apos;re ready for , because we have really mi@@ su@@ sed the science in this .
lots of people are doing things at the same time .
well , one thing is , it &apos;s not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the united states .
okay . you see that ?
it is thought to have been a re@@ plac@@ ement for the older space por@@ ts lo@@ cated , of course , at st@@ on@@ eh@@ enge and considered to be quite an improv@@ ement due to the un@@ clu@@ tter@@ ed design , the lack of dru@@ i@@ ds han@@ ging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
for example , we have an in@@ surance system where the person who dri@@ ves 20,000 miles a year pa@@ ys the same in@@ surance as somebody who dri@@ ves 3@@ ,000 .
right here , it &apos;s just a fo@@ cal -- right there .
you know we use p@@ vc , and we she@@ ath wir@@ es with p@@ vc for in@@ su@@ lation .
we had s@@ las@@ h and burn agriculture ; people cannot afford the fertili@@ zer , so they burn the trees and have the min@@ er@@ als available there ; the fir@@ es become more frequ@@ ent , and after a while you &apos;re stuck with an area of land where there is no ferti@@ lity left .
we can &apos;t afford to be cool and sit this one out .
it is an increasingly difficult picture , even as@@ sum@@ ing the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do .
but it was shor@@ tly afterwards that i discovered my once brilliant proce@@ d@@ ure had something like a million holes in it , and over the course of seven months , i pain@@ sta@@ k@@ ingly filled each and every one of those holes .
they cannot make sa@@ vings easy .
and i kind of try not to look back , you know .
&#91; cla@@ pping &#93; and they &apos;re getting lou@@ der , lou@@ der , lou@@ der , like really l@@ oud , right over us .
finding deep reson@@ an@@ ces with other religions and philosophi@@ es and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning .
so the problem is that meas@@ uring -- if you try to measure all the proteins , it &apos;s a very el@@ abor@@ ate process .
there is clearly a range of materials that con@@ stitu@@ te healthy food .
el you can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing .
so that &apos;s the experiment we did .
if you buy a two-@@ b@@ y-@@ four and it &apos;s not straight , you can take it back .
i started in 199@@ 9 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in new delhi .
i &apos;ve just got one question for you , peter .
and if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very specific organ .
i feel that i &apos;ve fi@@ tt@@ ed in , in many ways , to some of the things that i &apos;ve heard .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that can analy@@ ze the lingu@@ i@@ stic tra@@ ces of de@@ ception .
it &apos;s important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole .
and we see these amazing structures -- these little kn@@ ots of two colors of thre@@ ad we call &quot; social hot spots . &quot;
from this level , the more you can raise this angle of view , the more you will be important for the society .
and everyone said it was impossible .
and there are some brilliant lingu@@ i@@ sts , mostly russi@@ ans , who are working on that , at s@@ anta fe institute and in mos@@ cow , and i would love to see where that leads .
richard pre@@ ston : yes , that is corre@@ ct . i men@@ tioned hy@@ peri@@ on , the world &apos;s t@@ all@@ est tree .
nobody noticed the gn@@ arly stuff sort of looked ali@@ ke .
but what happened was that ma@@ da@@ gas@@ car went through a violent cou@@ p .
we &apos;re looking at cr@@ yst@@ al lat@@ ti@@ ces to see the bon@@ ding process in this .
i wi@@ shed to tell him that not only paraly@@ z@@ ers and paraly@@ ze@@ es must evolve , re@@ con@@ ci@@ le to reality , but we all must -- the aging and the anxi@@ ous and the di@@ vor@@ ced and the bal@@ ding and the ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and everyone .
ch@@ as@@ ing 2@@ 50,000 pieces of mal@@ ware a day is a massive challenge , and those numbers are only growing directly in propor@@ tion to the length of my stress line , you &apos;ll note here .
so penguins really diff@@ er in their person@@ ali@@ ties just like our do@@ gs and our cat@@ s .
we &apos;ve found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
so this model is an intelligent repres@@ ent@@ ation of reality .
there was once a stat@@ ement made by a psych@@ olo@@ gist that said that 80 percent of the pur@@ suit of happiness is really just about the genes , and it &apos;s as difficult to become happ@@ i@@ er as it is to become t@@ aller .
so there &apos;s a basic line for people . and also , it can be changed .
and &quot; confidence &quot; became a new york times best@@ s@@ eller and t@@ opp@@ ed business week &apos;s hard@@ cover best@@ s@@ eller list .
these african students are doing their home@@ work under stre@@ et@@ lights at the air@@ port in the capital city because they don &apos;t have any electricity at home .
they resi@@ st the temp@@ tation . they del@@ a@@ y the now for later .
see me now . don &apos;t talk about it later .
the four cor@@ ners of the world are watching , so travel daughter , travel .
it &apos;s a little paper chip .
those are cap@@ tured in the char@@ ter .
and just as these north@@ -@@ to-@@ south trans@@ fers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ fers .
but we break it down to some basic reali@@ ties .
those guys drin@@ king all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their lo@@ g@@ books , trying to get this thing to work , with all these 2,@@ 600 v@@ acu@@ um tu@@ bes that failed half the time .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , &quot; what hand gras@@ p pattern do i want ? &quot;
it &apos;s hard to con@@ cei@@ ve , and beg@@ s more questions .
but that would sort of be jump@@ ing to the middle of the story , and i &apos;m not going to show you that poli@@ shed video .
but sometimes i see this ingeni@@ ous idea in there , and i have this eu@@ re@@ ka moment .
they &apos;re going to survive as long as our species survi@@ ves on what shakespeare called &quot; this mor@@ tal co@@ il . &quot;
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bi@@ li@@ tat@@ ing disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will m@@ elt down if you think it already has@@ n &apos;t , and where we are clini@@ cally today , and where we might go tom@@ or@@ row , and what some of the hur@@ d@@ les are .
so this is just the first of three attac@@ ks that occurred in that scene .
but just a few months ago , ju@@ dy was diagno@@ sed with sta@@ ge-@@ three lung cancer .
well , i in@@ tend to build these self-@@ organized learning environ@@ ments .
and now we think we know .
it &apos;s a great place for par@@ ties -- it was , it was only up for six weeks .
at my feet , the path to the north to@@ wer -- 60 yards of wire ro@@ pe .
other people are going to say , &quot; this is great .
in 2010 , only on facebook , in a single month , 2.@@ 5 billion photos were up@@ loaded , most of them identi@@ fied .
if you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200@@ ,000 , from a million to two million , 10 to 20 million , it doesn &apos;t matter , then systemati@@ cally you get a 15 percent increase in wa@@ ges , wealth , number of aids cases , number of police , anything you can think of .
he turned the wrong valve when he filled his cy@@ lin@@ der -- he had 80 percent oxygen in his t@@ ank when he should have had 40 .
people are always asking , &quot; well , who &apos;s in charge of this ? &quot;
a him@@ ba is one of the 2@@ 9 ethni@@ c groups in nami@@ bia .
and suddenly , brenn@@ an walked over to my chair and he grab@@ bed the bell , the bell i ring to signal a change or a re@@ conven@@ ing of cab@@ ine@@ ts , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the bell .
i &apos;ll ask the techni@@ cians to start the music .
well , i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by heli@@ cop@@ ters , so -- and each time , i didn &apos;t expect to come home to tell the tale .
then i am dro@@ w@@ ning , in des@@ pair at having to leave her , this , everything , all , unbe@@ ar@@ able , awful .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappe@@ ared into the sha@@ do@@ ws , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
there is a zone there , around gu@@ ant@@ an@@ am@@ o bay , where a treat@@ y gives the united states admini@@ stra@@ tive responsibility for a piece of land that &apos;s about twice the size of manhattan .
so what &apos;s wrong ?
but heavy arti@@ ll@@ er@@ y is nothing new in terror@@ ist oper@@ ations .
true story .
thank you very much . good@@ by@@ e .
but things are changing , and one of the reasons why is the digital na@@ tives , or gen@@ -@@ y .
we were sitting over there with a country in a down@@ fall , in a slo@@ w-@@ motion down@@ fall .
&quot; how am i going to fit this into everything else i &apos;m doing ? &quot;
but mr. tes@@ z@@ ler answered , &quot; no , that will not be necessary .
that costs about 100 dollars .
he was ar@@ rested because there were trans@@ fers of eight million dollars that went into some dor@@ m@@ ant accoun@@ ts that belon@@ ged to him and his family .
and they , if you try to produce a different wall with this 18@@ th one , it will have to have the same symme@@ tries as one of these 17 .
what do you think these people are doing ?
that &apos;s rou@@ tin@@ ely transl@@ ated as , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
1@@ 50,000 people from all over the world , doctors of every race , religion , culture and nation , who f@@ ought side by side , brothers and si@@ sters , with each other , not against each other , in a common cause to make the world better .
film@@ makers , friends of mine , they look at nollywood and they say , &quot; wow , they are doing what we really want to do , and make a bu@@ ck and live with this job . &quot;
but , like sar@@ din@@ ia , o@@ kin@@ a@@ wa has a few social constru@@ cts that we can associ@@ ate with lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
this is the basis . the imi@@ tation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
mo@@ she saf@@ die : building uni@@ qu@@ eness
frei ot@@ to was starting to use fo@@ am bu@@ bble dia@@ grams and fo@@ am bu@@ bble models to generate his man@@ n@@ heim conc@@ ert hall .
and we didn &apos;t have -- like , my mother pre@@ si@@ ded over the back y@@ ard from an up@@ stairs window , where she would be ir@@ oning or something like that .
there will be a sp@@ inning magne@@ tic field .
and i was asked , &quot; well aren &apos;t you ner@@ v@@ ous ?
so , everything that i put into my body i considered as medicine .
and what you see is -- actually , the red dot@@ ted line shows the track of this per@@ forming element , which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was a robo@@ tic dri@@ ll , basically , that went all the way around , cru@@ is@@ ed the museum , went all around the walls and did a lot of damage .
if i had not gro@@ wn up in nigeria , and if all i knew about africa were from popular images , i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landsc@@ apes , beautiful animals , and in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible people , fighting sen@@ sel@@ ess wars , dying of poverty and aids , un@@ able to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind , white foreig@@ ner .
has@@ an , thank you very much .
we set out to do this .
but that kind of condi@@ tioning just kept me there for so many years , until i re@@ ached my mi@@ d-@@ 3@@ 0s and i thought , &quot; you know , i &apos;m not getting any younger .
jo@@ dy willi@@ ams : a reali@@ stic vision for world peace
and you know , i don &apos;t say that i do everything well , i just say that i do a lot of things , that &apos;s all .
it sounds really dum@@ b , but that &apos;s what it is .
you know , of course , this is via un@@ o shoes .
martin luther king did not say , &quot; i have a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he inspired the civil rights mov@@ ements .
you learn things un@@ consci@@ ously .
i then challen@@ ged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
after these genom@@ es are synthe@@ si@@ zed , the first step is just tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ting them into a cell without a genome .
it meant , for the first time , i could read back what i had ty@@ ped into it .
this is just theore@@ tical .
net green@@ house gas emissions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolute ton@@ na@@ ge .
you had to survive .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diver@@ si@@ fy -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil se@@ ctor alone , but from non-@@ oil .
i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or ti@@ me@@ -@@ specific elements .
sil@@ k , gra@@ y , those beautiful butt@@ ons .
and i was just recently at the eve online fan festi@@ val in re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ v@@ í@@ k that was quite amazing .
if we really want to see the kind of wide con@@ su@@ mer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environ@@ ment@@ ali@@ sts and food people , maybe we just need to di@@ tch the term &quot; con@@ su@@ mer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
we can no longer pret@@ end that we just spe@@ cu@@ late about politics , we need to look at this in a ri@@ gor@@ ous way .
he came up with this bo@@ w@@ den@@ -@@ we@@ dge he@@ el that has to be made out of steel or ti@@ tani@@ um ; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material , it &apos;ll actually cra@@ ck in two .
but i feel a bit like a fish out of water .
and if you look , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s only one way you can score three .

focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bu@@ bble , the so-called &quot; bu@@ bble kids &quot; -- kids where your inter@@ vention can get them just maybe over the line from fail@@ ing to pas@@ sing .
and there are industrial ver@@ sions of this -- about 20,000 dollars .
the g@@ 8 nations have been incredibly gener@@ ous on polio over the last 20 years , but we &apos;re starting to have something called polio fa@@ ti@@ gue and that is that the don@@ or nations aren &apos;t willing to fund polio any longer .
20 researchers can stand on a bridge su@@ sp@@ ended inside of the sphere , and be completely immer@@ sed in their data .
and now , all six cu@@ ps . should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose ?
we need a dra@@ stic change in the way we think and be@@ have to transform bul@@ gari@@ a for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
that earth would likely warm in the 198@@ 0 &apos;s , and warming would ex@@ ce@@ ed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century .
you can see the cop@@ per ti@@ ps on these things .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we con@@ done .
so you burn off the ha@@ agen@@ -@@ da@@ z@@ s from the night before ?
r@@ s@@ w : what &apos;s his sch@@ edu@@ le on that ?
and our mission is to produce enter@@ tain@@ ment that creates and inspi@@ res social change .
ah : oh my god , it &apos;s har@@ sh up here .
in fact , it became the largest re@@ habi@@ li@@ tation len@@ der in the country .
pm : yeah , the house lights and we &apos;ll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better .
and this disorder is in direct contra@@ st to the un@@ alter@@ able order of a b@@ loo@@ d@@ line .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i del@@ ta , and the lower left of that picture is the tex@@ as@@ -@@ mexi@@ co bor@@ der .
so the evolution of this -- i ga@@ ther this isn &apos;t your first pen@@ d@@ ul@@ um .
since we had never been separ@@ ated , and i thought we would be together forever , i didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left .

he &apos;s turning 50 this year , and he &apos;s convin@@ ced that the rich ta@@ pe@@ stry of repu@@ tation he &apos;s built on air@@ b@@ n@@ b will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life .
but there was no way to pre@@ p@@ are for the live television aspe@@ ct of it , being on op@@ ra@@ h .
so this is , rela@@ tively , a new show that we &apos;re now beginning to tour .
but the truth is that , on average , turning that g@@ unk into cru@@ de oil produ@@ ces about three times more green@@ house gas pollu@@ tion than it does to produce conven@@ tional oil in canada .
you have extreme conc@@ ern with everybody else &apos;s business and much invol@@ v@@ ement in everybody else &apos;s life .
so that &apos;s why v@@ cs love to fund seri@@ al entrepreneurs .
the packa@@ ging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
some of you may recogni@@ ze this image .
as dir@@ k hel@@ bing poin@@ ted out in the last quote , we don &apos;t really understand the complexity that rel@@ ates to us , that surro@@ unds us .
pm : yeah . yes , yes , of course .
here &apos;s a little picture of derek going up now , when you were with your nan@@ ny .
they &apos;re the largest private emplo@@ yer in america .
and look , i know it &apos;s weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this .
then he asked , &quot; why should china sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce our growth so that the west can continue to be pro@@ fli@@ gate and stupid ? &quot;
they &apos;re still our clo@@ sest genetic kin .
the u.@@ n@@ . has the conven@@ tion on the rights of the child .
govern@@ ment@@ -@@ appro@@ ved , american cancer society , but patients know what patients want to know .
it &apos;s kind of like the dir@@ ty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don &apos;t spend it very wi@@ sely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
well , you see self-@@ organi@@ zing patterns that spon@@ tane@@ ously occur in this board game .
most spi@@ ders use cop@@ i@@ ous amo@@ un@@ ts of sil@@ k , and sil@@ k is essential to their survival and re@@ production .
explor@@ ing at the fron@@ tier of science , at the fron@@ tier of human understanding , is min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing .
so some people believe that the indu@@ s script represents an ancient in@@ do@@ -@@ european language such as san@@ sk@@ rit .
ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca , if you include the ice shel@@ ves , is twice the size of au@@ str@@ alia -- it &apos;s a big place .
when the magazine -- actually , when i got the sub@@ scri@@ ption -- it was 12 following pages .
it was clean , effi@@ cient , there was no high , there was really no dan@@ ger , it had no street value .
he does say that , and we think he &apos;s being un@@ reali@@ stic and sort of spiritual and high@@ fal@@ u@@ tin . &quot; nice for him to say it , but i can &apos;t do that . &quot;
and that will stop re@@ using a sy@@ ringe 20 or 30 times .
this is an idea that we got from a fellow ted@@ ster here , dan den@@ nett , who talked about taking the inten@@ tional stance .
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of mira@@ cle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as a@@ ver@@ ages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the gu@@ ess@@ work .
we &apos;re cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers .
so these numbers are the numbers which den@@ ote the rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess of these surfaces .
as a result , in the russi@@ an far east today , which is twice the size of india , you have exactly six million russi@@ ans .
i play the part of a magi@@ cian , a wi@@ z@@ ard , if you will , a real wi@@ z@@ ard .
i want , really , to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford .
i don &apos;t have to tell you this .
and this has been a smooth pro@@ gr@@ ession since the beginning of the genome project .
bir@@ ke ba@@ e@@ hr : what &apos;s wrong with our food system
to support this view , they wrote in my chart that i was un@@ able to do my yale law school home@@ work .
like a for@@ bi@@ dden pleasure . and it &apos;s that for@@ bi@@ dden pleasure that i think is what reson@@ ates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defin@@ es kind of what i feel , too -- that i &apos;m dra@@ wn to have a good life .
and now i &apos;m going to kill the mag@@ g@@ ots ? &quot;
and so the logical thing to think was that : &quot; well , the next generation -- so they &apos;re going to age out of the gang , like everybody else has , and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . &quot; you just figure out a way to make more money faster .
we wish we &apos;d taken better advan@@ tage of the education that we did have .
and they had lungs .
and it &apos;s why it was invented .
it &apos;s acting only as a cell deli@@ very vehicle .
i would never have the money to actually pay for the inst@@ all@@ ment or pay for all the bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards or the production of these , so there &apos;s always a cli@@ ent atta@@ ched to them .
everybody foc@@ uses on the things that kill us , and that &apos;s what i was foc@@ using on .
it &apos;s an ele@@ ction .
neither of them atten@@ ded university .
so you let a po@@ ll station wor@@ ker scan your en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted vote .
the waste systems all connect .
now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are in@@ nat@@ ely equi@@ pped with something , perhaps in our brains , some ab@@ normal chromo@@ some that causes this muse@@ -like effect .
people who spent money on other people got happ@@ i@@ er .
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in the lab@@ s or the hall@@ s of academi@@ a but on laptops , des@@ kt@@ ops , in the pal@@ ms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
but we can pus@@ h this idea further .
it happened through a principle known as kin sele@@ ction .
one of the thre@@ ads that seems to have come through l@@ oud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le what the big wants -- the &quot; big &quot; being the organization , the system , the country -- and what the &quot; small &quot; wants -- the individual , the person .
the w@@ ok shot caught fire three times .
it was one of the best issues ever . and they talked about the neur@@ on and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains . it was really quite im@@ pres@@ sive .
it started to become hard to raise oper@@ a@@ tional costs , oper@@ a@@ tional budgets .
i like that one : nami@@ bia ser@@ ving as a model to africa , and africa ser@@ ving as a model to the united states .
and tragi@@ cally , in 199@@ 9 , when she was in col@@ om@@ bia working with the u &apos;@@ wa people , focused on pres@@ er@@ ving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were ab@@ du@@ cted and tor@@ tured and killed by the far@@ c .
even last year , i ended up hi@@ king up mt . ki@@ li@@ man@@ j@@ ar@@ o , the highest mountain in africa .
just me and go@@ d-@@ given talent .
and for me , this is -- i &apos;m the short kid on the right .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ olin@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ graduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little ner@@ v@@ ous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swe@@ dish college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
and the other one was called &quot; ad@@ or@@ able . &quot;
and they call the internet ir@@ responsible .
if you look at that su@@ b , you &apos;ll see a sphere .
this is because , although each cell in our bodies con@@ tains the same set of genes , different mi@@ xes of genes get turned on and off in different cells .
it doesn &apos;t actually take pictures , but it &apos;s a hell of a lot cheaper , and you still feel like you were there .
try to get d@@ s@@ l inst@@ all@@ ed in your house .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
here are a few .
it seems that nobody had actually ever coun@@ ted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
making all this money will get you sent directly to hell .
they &apos;re obsessed with having the biggest , t@@ all@@ est , lon@@ gest , as we all know .
this ab@@ alone sh@@ ell is a bio@@ com@@ posite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate and two percent by mass protein .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
secon@@ dly , when we talk about men who are succe@@ eding , we ri@@ ghtly consider them i@@ con@@ s or pi@@ one@@ ers or inno@@ v@@ ators to be e@@ mul@@ ated .
the drugs policy which we &apos;ve had in place for 40 years is long over@@ due for a very serious re@@ think , in my opinion .
if we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pi@@ es , we want to make sure it &apos;s neither too easy , nor too difficult , to find a pie .
and their own person@@ ali@@ ties come out in totally unique ways .
so in fact , this is a pretty accu@@ rate esti@@ mate of the number of planets in our galaxy , just in our galaxy , by the way , and i remind the non-@@ astron@@ omy maj@@ ors among you that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our telescop@@ es .
it &apos;s at the top of the pyrami@@ d of evidence .
we asked a question about how the mind works , and we let our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers play the role of so many blind men fil@@ ling out the elephant .
and they brought their knowledge .
he said it was his profi@@ le . &quot; then what are you ? &quot; i asked . &quot; an actor , &quot; he said .
think about your own work .
and in the artifi@@ cial se@@ men was a radi@@ o-@@ op@@ a@@ que sub@@ stance , such that it would show up on an x-@@ ray .
so where do you go in sex ?
come talk to me about it , i &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want .
what about those of you who say he should be given a golf c@@ art ?
this was done by ter@@ u@@ o o@@ kan@@ o at to@@ k@@ yo women &apos;s hospital .
you know , everything says , here &apos;s the growth rate of china , here &apos;s the growth rate of the u.s. , here it goes -- straight line .
these are sh@@ ots my wife took a couple days after the qu@@ a@@ ke , while i was making my way through the d@@ .@@ r@@ . into the country .
the study showed that food companies ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated typically seven times more than an independent study .
steven pin@@ ker : human nature and the blank s@@ late
and we just record what we see . &quot;
the er@@ r@@ ors we make are actually predict@@ able .
i can sur@@ f the web , exchange e@@ mail with people , and rou@@ tin@@ ely destroy my friend steve cou@@ sins in online word games .
we s@@ at in ro@@ ws of des@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty auton@@ om@@ ously .
i don &apos;t know how many wor@@ ms &#91; were &#93; in there , but i &apos;ve got some heavy kar@@ ma coming , i tell you .
when you put them si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are .
so i can go back to my story .
this is the kind of future i think we need , is a future that has the same diversity and ab@@ un@@ dance and dy@@ na@@ mis@@ m of manhattan , but that lear@@ ns from the sustain@@ ability of the past , of the ecolo@@ gy , the original ecolo@@ gy , of nature with all its parts .
i tried to think , &quot; how do i respond to that hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness ?
and so , i thought perhaps in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated men and women -- who don &apos;t have access to nature , who often have a lot of time , they often have space , and you don &apos;t need any sharp tools to work with mos@@ ses -- would be great part@@ ners .
if not , it goes into the toilet .
so by all means , go ahead and do that , that &apos;s good .
the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry is in deep trouble .
it &apos;s not any more pri@@ ce@@ y than regular electronics .
so that &apos;s sort of the the@@ me : big , different and gone .
that &apos;s im@@ pres@@ sive .
but in her lexi@@ con , &quot; sorry , the rest unknown , thank you &quot; is &quot; sorry , the rest unknown , go to hell , &quot; because she couldn &apos;t care less .
it &apos;s real stuff .
they are entrepreneurs . &#91; unclear &#93; told us they are always about four percent of the population , but 16 percent are imi@@ tat@@ ors .
so i think that right now , many people in the audience are asking , &quot; okay , when are you developing a dou@@ ble@@ -@@ se@@ ater so they can fly with you ? &quot;
i &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in ger@@ many and in fr@@ ance , and in different parts of the world -- 10@@ 5 countries it &apos;s been my pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge to speak in .
and i realized , the roots of the way i sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
so , you start with something in the computer .
most bats look like the previ@@ ous one .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the ra@@ il@@ ways , and the british built a lot of ra@@ il@@ ways in india .
it &apos;s happening in comm@@ un@@ ist china , in for@@ mer@@ ly comm@@ un@@ ist russia , it &apos;s happening in india , in my own native canada .
and we have a more gen@@ der@@ -@@ bal@@ an@@ ced new@@ s@@ room today .
and with absolute difference -- and i mean a difference where people inside africa at a certain position , where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter , and everybody outside africa has another letter .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
now we &apos;re going to do some movi@@ es . &quot;
they dre@@ amed up a variety of horri@@ fying scen@@ ari@@ os .
whether you &apos;re a political party insi@@ sting to your de@@ tri@@ ment on a very ri@@ gi@@ d notion of who belon@@ gs and who does not , whether you &apos;re the government prote@@ cting social institutions like marri@@ age and re@@ stri@@ cting access of those institutions to the few , whether you &apos;re a teenager in her bedro@@ om who &apos;s trying to jo@@ stle her rela@@ tions with her parents , stran@@ gen@@ ess is a way to think about how we pa@@ ve the way to new kinds of rela@@ tions .
we created uni@@ ons .
they then poin@@ ted out that there &apos;d be , sort of , the other contro@@ ls by wire , to get rid of all that mechanical stuff .
so when we decided to work in r@@ wand@@ a on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the aids problem , we wanted to build a heal@@ th@@ care network , because it had been totally destro@@ yed during the geno@@ cide in 199@@ 4 , and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day .
it em@@ powers auth@@ ori@@ ties , without activ@@ ating the citizens -- their hands , legs , brains , what have you .
the interface just kind of disappe@@ ars .
after a fire , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; okay , great . &quot;
because these different languages im@@ pose a bar@@ rier , as we &apos;ve just seen , to the trans@@ fer of goo@@ ds and ideas and technologies and wisdom .
upon my arri@@ val in new york , i decided -- they were children of sugar plan@@ tation workers .
i was pre-@@ med at the time , and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anat@@ omy and dis@@ se@@ cting animals really pi@@ qu@@ ed my curi@@ o@@ sity .
so , there &apos;s another picture . here , this one . i really do like this picture .
once each year , the fa@@ st@@ est young boy in each ham@@ let is given the honor of becoming a woman .
he said , &quot; well what are you doing ? &quot;
so when we are con@@ fron@@ ted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : we can look away , or we can address the image .
so seeing this in a very simple , di@@ gni@@ fied way was a very powerful experience .
at the bottom right you see a robot per@@ forming a 3@@ 60 degre@@ e flip in less than half a second .
but this is not available in par@@ ol .
the second , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re that close .
and if africa is going to get fix@@ ed , it &apos;s by them , not by us .
and with that , let me take you now for a first tour into the data .
tan le &apos;s ast@@ oni@@ shing new computer interface re@@ ads its user &apos;s brain@@ waves , making it possible to control virtual objects , and even physical electronics , with m@@ ere thoughts . she demo@@ s the head@@ set , and talks about its far@@ -@@ re@@ aching appli@@ cations .
these car@@ ds , now , thanks to me showing up , are being saved .
you know , the fol@@ k tal@@ es of ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a and ra@@ may@@ ana , the two hol@@ y books , the epi@@ cs that everything comes out of in india , they say . after seeing that j@@ at@@ ra , the fol@@ k theater , i knew i wanted to get on , you know , and perform .
that &apos;s what europe and north america repres@@ ented .
we extra@@ po@@ late back@@ wards and say the galaxy is up here .
we need groups to work together that never have .
and this view generally belie@@ ves that there is a role for government , a small role , to set the rules so people aren &apos;t lying and che@@ ating and hur@@ ting each other , maybe , you know , have a police force and a fire department and an army , but to have a very limited reach into the mechan@@ isms of this machin@@ er@@ y .
i asked him , &quot; why ? &quot;
believe it or not , even with intern@@ al vi@@ sc@@ era .
do they allow for poll@@ ination , pollin@@ ator path@@ ways that bees and bu@@ tter@@ flies and such can come back into our cities ?
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender ine@@ qui@@ ty .
yes , not maybe one , 10 years , maybe i can die within one year , or something like that .
i &apos;ve always known that the age of design is upon us , almost like a ra@@ p@@ ture .
they &apos;re just ch@@ opp@@ ed at different hei@@ ghts .
climate change is affe@@ cting our homes , our communities , our way of life . we should be prepar@@ ing at every scale and at every opportunity .
ad@@ venti@@ sts are conser@@ va@@ tive metho@@ di@@ sts .
i &apos;m going to re@@ fer to some of those as well , and i &apos;m just going to men@@ tion a few of the com@@ mit@@ ments as illu@@ stra@@ tions that we &apos;ve got .
and then you can high@@ light it into something like , yes , cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing@@ .@@ org .
mar@@ ge is 10@@ 4 .
while most other cities were growing an un@@ differ@@ enti@@ ated sp@@ are ti@@ re of spra@@ w@@ l , they institu@@ ted an urban growth boun@@ dar@@ y .
and for those living in the most de@@ humani@@ zing conditions of mental ill@@ ness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beauty of music off@@ ers a chance for them to tran@@ sc@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not for@@ gotten them .
and i &apos;m thinking , no , this is not possible .
sm : so what &apos;s happening here ?
this is a photo of a le@@ mon shark pu@@ p , and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these prote@@ ctive man@@ gro@@ ves .
so here &apos;s a series of projects over the last few years where i &apos;ve been inspired by trying to figure out how to really faci@@ li@@ tate close connection .
let me know when you &apos;ve got them . let &apos;s shoot .
so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project .
and i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and ment@@ oring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
i went home .
i said , &quot; well , where would you build this thing ? &quot;
the man was without legs and only with one arm .
they affect our bank accoun@@ ts .
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes gla@@ ze over .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
so , next — oh , mind you . those are the community .
they are what we just said -- faci@@ al fe@@ atures , hair structure , skin color .
we have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools .
i think this is what they want . they want quality of life to keep increasing .
thank you very much .
we bring mothers who have hiv , who &apos;ve been through these p@@ m@@ t@@ ct pro@@ grams in the very faci@@ lities , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nur@@ ses as part of the health care team .
now , there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil .
we went back to afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
with the erosion of the green b@@ elt separ@@ ating animals from humans , we live in each other &apos;s vi@@ ral environment .
maybe some@@ time in the future , we will .
we can cop@@ e with the sub@@ tle@@ ties of language brilli@@ antly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
now we &apos;re not using our strength because we are the biggest si@@ ssi@@ es in the jung@@ le .
our idea for the bi@@ d was 100 percent solar cool@@ ing , based on the idea that we use the roof of the sta@@ dia , we cover the ro@@ o@@ fs of the sta@@ dia with p@@ v systems .
i have transformed the las@@ er be@@ am into an ecolo@@ gi@@ cal , recycl@@ able version here , in green india .
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women , breast cancer , is regul@@ ated by est@@ ro@@ gen and by this enzy@@ me ar@@ om@@ at@@ ase .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; knowing what i know , why am i not a vege@@ t@@ arian ? &quot;
when kids play tea party , or they play cop@@ s and rob@@ bers , they &apos;re following a script that they &apos;ve agre@@ ed to .
home is a transi@@ ent concept .
ok , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
but industry lob@@ by@@ i@@ sts would never let that happen .
so we &apos;re not in a uni@@ qu@@ ely hospi@@ table place .
so what we did was cros@@ s-@@ cut a bunch of archi@@ val foot@@ age of john@@ ny c@@ ash , and at eight fra@@ mes a second , we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get wo@@ ven into this dynami@@ cally changing music video .
and i was pulling a mole@@ cule out of this bag .
or sometimes you say you &apos;re leading with your heart , or you &apos;re leading with your soul .
your name is lu@@ cy , okay ?
but , then he came back , and things happened , and i decided i really hat@@ ed my writing , that it was awful , awful , purple pro@@ se .
engineer : i felt i was disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted about it .
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
how do you not des@@ pair when , with the body ra@@ va@@ ged by che@@ mo@@ therapy , clim@@ bing a m@@ ere flight of stairs was she@@ er tor@@ ture , that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ?
talk about a sweet beginning .
cs : the bar@@ re@@ l of the gun !
this is a bar@@ ga@@ ining game .
our next questions was : could we actually visuali@@ ze this spread ?
that &apos;s india and this is china . size is population .
so you can see that we ad@@ ded everything to our en@@ dea@@ vor to make life better for the people .
we also built the city &apos;s -- new york city &apos;s first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our off@@ ices .
do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
a couple weeks later their bo@@ ss , frank mc@@ cl@@ ure , pul@@ ls them into the room and says , &quot; hey , you guys , i have to ask you something about that project you were working on .
and , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .
to see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the work@@ force that is now , you have to look at our future work@@ force .
and the she@@ pher@@ d dra@@ ws clo@@ ser and clo@@ ser , and the giant sees that he &apos;s carrying a staff .
i was tor@@ n between mathematics and media .
so , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am i doing here ?
blo@@ gging affe@@ cts your post@@ ure . we start with the post@@ ure .
but anyway , i gave that te@@ stim@@ ony , and that pres@@ ented me with a crisis .
the l@@ x@@ d electri@@ fy the ted@@ 2010 stage with an emerging global stre@@ et@@ -@@ dance culture , re@@ v@@ ved up by the internet . in a pre@@ view of j@@ on ch@@ u &apos;s up@@ coming web series , this ast@@ oni@@ shing trou@@ pe show off their super@@ powers .
the philosop@@ her says , &quot; i &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done .
our genes seem to have a@@ wes@@ ome power over our dest@@ ini@@ es .
and who knows ? somebody will li@@ cen@@ se this technology and develop market@@ able products , and she would get revenue .
i had no idea . that &apos;s the sort of thing that happens to someone else , not me , sur@@ ely .
this is one of the students , k@@ hal@@ ed ham@@ dan .
this provi@@ des a slightly more statisti@@ cal look at things .
now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight .
i did a sur@@ v@@ ey of a number of species of arti@@ facts in my house , and there &apos;s 6@@ ,000 . other people have come up with 10,000 .
pin@@ k .
nature provi@@ des a first dra@@ ft , which experience then re@@ vi@@ ses .
and that &apos;s really medi@@ ated by the sex hor@@ mon@@ es .
and it &apos;ll depend on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we &apos;re willing to accept the risk of the@@ ft .
we &apos;re ta@@ gging on the california coast , and we &apos;re ta@@ gging over in taiwan and japan .
i am more inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ able than a@@ chil@@ les ; fortun@@ e hat@@ h not one place to hit me . &quot;
you might not know that con@@ an do@@ yle went to medical school here in e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and his character , sher@@ lock hol@@ mes , was inspired by sir joseph bell .
these are the sen@@ ti@@ ments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
ever since i can remember thinking consci@@ ously about such things , communication has been my central passion .
they need to know : out of all the things i could do , what is the best way to achieve my go@@ als ?
and i can &apos;t believe a poli@@ ce@@ man is going to give themselves a ticket .
it costs about three dollars to down@@ load , print and b@@ ind a normal , old book .
so it might be that you would just have to fine t@@ une it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adol@@ esc@@ ents , have to go through two adol@@ esc@@ ences .
and my mom took these pictures actually , last week , of our car@@ pe@@ ts , and i remember this to this day .
the ar@@ c@@ tic -- a beautiful system -- a regul@@ ating bi@@ ome at the planet@@ ary level , taking the kno@@ ck after kno@@ ck on climate change , appe@@ aring to be in a good state .
but you get the sense of the hall in se@@ ction .
unfortunately , what you hold in your hand has not only en@@ ab@@ led incredible technological development and industrial expansion , but it has also contribu@@ ted to uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able human suffering .
that big brown makes his ey@@ es@@ pot very big .
because our da@@ d@@ dies are our mi@@ rr@@ ors that we refle@@ ct back on when we decide about what type of man we deser@@ ve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
we are one out@@ come of a continu@@ ing adap@@ ta@@ tional process .
in one study of college students , they asked a lot of questions about love , but the two that stood out to me the most were , &quot; have you ever been re@@ je@@ cted by somebody who you really lo@@ ved ? &quot;
people are gla@@ dly willing to wait : as long as they &apos;re waiting 12 , they might as well wait 13 .
to make the future rather than wait for it .
but that is actually changing .
some people get less dres@@ sed up .
but then the people that the roman@@ s would have called scot@@ tish bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ans , my ancestors , were actually part of the industrial revolution , and in the 19@@ th century , growth began to acceler@@ ate , and you saw that get qui@@ cker and qui@@ cker , and it &apos;s been imp@@ acting everyone .
we just said , we &apos;re not going to use it on us .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 18@@ 00 .
and i &apos;m very excited about this , because one thing we &apos;re working on is trans@@ forming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional cro@@ ps .
&quot; star fo@@ x 20 &quot; ?
now , the importance of this is not the techni@@ que that you &apos;ve seen here .
now the ir@@ ony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collabor@@ ative behavi@@ ors that are har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red in all of us .
built the tes@@ la co@@ il . this to@@ wer was built on long island back at the beginning of the 19@@ 0@@ 0s .
can you qu@@ anti@@ fy your open@@ ness ?
the changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equ@@ ally .
we already have the data showing that it redu@@ ces the du@@ ration of your flu by a few hours .
but , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
i was a strange child .
now i &apos;m talking about the &apos; 3@@ 0s .
and i love pain@@ t@@ ings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .
how was our role in this garden similar and different ?
and the har@@ der he squee@@ zes -- you see a little black thing in the middle that &apos;s pushing on his skin propor@@ tional to how hard he squee@@ zes .
this is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons .
they &apos;re fighting bat@@ tles over much nar@@ ro@@ wer issues .
the design process for charles and ray never ended in manufac@@ turing .
r@@ s@@ w : didn &apos;t get a lau@@ gh .
why ? because the path i had taken was considered out of bo@@ unds .
and to me , that &apos;s the most important thing because , ever since being a kid , i &apos;ve wanted to communicate my passion and love .
should those be in the new packa@@ ge of go@@ als ?
why should they put more money into your company , if you &apos;re not passionate about it ?
there are four humans in this shot -- one , two , three , four .
and what did she say to me ? &apos; i love you ! &apos; &quot; they always say that .
and the effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess of a group is not determined by the i@@ q of the group ; it &apos;s determined by how well they communicate , how often they take turns in conversation .
i mean , if you can think how important -- if you have a gps system and there are no satelli@@ tes , it &apos;s not going to be much use . but , like -- but , you know , if somebody had a gps system in the 17@@ th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it , you know . if that person -- audience : for the ted@@ dy be@@ ar ? the ted@@ dy be@@ ar ?
&quot; one has only to gl@@ ance at its press fil@@ ms , fashion shows , beauty con@@ tests , ball@@ rooms , wine b@@ ars and broad@@ casting sta@@ tions . &quot; me@@ mes .
and whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . &quot;
they say , &quot; this is not fair , because these countries had vac@@ cin@@ es and anti@@ bio@@ tics that were not available for swe@@ den .
this was either an old product with new packa@@ ging , or a brand@@ -@@ new packa@@ ge , and i just thought , y@@ i@@ kes ! how &apos;s that still happening ?
on oc@@ tober 4 , 1957 , they laun@@ ched their ro@@ cket .
if anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own cap@@ abilities .
and i , nai@@ vely by this stage , said , &quot; oh , yes , sure . &quot;
so , i started full focus .
because it &apos;s obviously incredibly fri@@ ghten@@ ing .
you &apos;re telling each unit if it should turn right or left .
so here is a typical stu@@ d wall , an architectural construction , and this is a se@@ ction of our pro@@ posal for a meat house , where you can see we use f@@ at@@ ty cells as in@@ su@@ lation , ci@@ li@@ a for dealing with wind loads and sp@@ hin@@ c@@ ter mu@@ sc@@ les for the do@@ ors and windows .
and i asked him one question .
it &apos;s on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of nai@@ rob@@ i , the capital city of ken@@ ya .
what &apos;s interesting about high falls is that although we use air@@ ba@@ gs , and some air@@ ba@@ gs are quite advanced , they &apos;re designed so you don &apos;t sli@@ p off the side like you used to , if you land a bit wrong . so , they &apos;re a much sa@@ fer pro@@ position .
so , it says , &quot; you want to lo@@ g sexu@@ al activity .
and their response is dra@@ con@@ i@@ an , and not necessarily the one that &apos;s going to get them out of this .
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
take a look at mathemati@@ cal at@@ tain@@ ment by 15 year-@@ ol@@ ds .
the ot@@ tom@@ an empire &apos;s not that far from europe , but there &apos;s no scientific revolution there .
what have we ga@@ ined at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last 20 years ?
sometimes we just forget .
so this building actually cele@@ br@@ ates the water as it comes out of the recycl@@ ing plant and goes into the re@@ ed bed so that it can be fil@@ tered for the final time .
and so i ur@@ ge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-@@ and@@ -@@ them world , and reali@@ zing that it &apos;s about all of us , and the kind of world that we , together , want to live in and share .
when you &apos;re standing in a tren@@ ch all alone , if you could have survived , you &apos;re okay , you &apos;ve passed .
and finally goes to e , and it &apos;s home .
all of these are experiences .
when i &apos;m out trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing equipment or problems with something in a plant , they don &apos;t seem to be able to figure out , &quot; do i have a training people issue ?
this is a us na@@ vy war@@ ship .
i said , &quot; well , i met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card . &quot;
but when i &apos;m read@@ ing with synthe@@ tic voices , i love to come home and read a ra@@ cy no@@ vel with a real voice .
so , i started this explor@@ ation around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my des@@ k .
it is important in choo@@ sing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of compe@@ t@@ ence that interests you deeply , and focus on that .
long ago , you k@@ is@@ sed the names of the nine mu@@ ses goo@@ d-@@ by@@ e and you wat@@ ched the quad@@ ra@@ tic equation p@@ ack its bag .
and this guy , you get a guy like l@@ t. gen@@ . willi@@ am bo@@ y@@ kin .
moving to the third comm@@ and@@ ment .
and it &apos;s all bru@@ te force . and that &apos;s the way we &apos;ve been appro@@ aching energy . so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that &apos;s based on bru@@ te force as you start mer@@ ging that system and learning that system and actually app@@ lying biology . and you move from a di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine of engineering , you move from a di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine of chemistry , into a di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine of biology . and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me .
it is the hot topic .
and i just want you to think a little bit about , remember for yourself , it &apos;s anno@@ ying when you hit this thing .
this is a port@@ able ultras@@ ound .
why are those numbers so fin@@ ely tun@@ ed to allow stars to shine and planets to form , when we recogni@@ ze that if you fi@@ ddle with those numbers -- if i had 20 di@@ als up here and i let you come up and fi@@ ddle with those numbers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe disappear .
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being speci@@ alized in something other than what is happening with their typical pe@@ ers .
okay , i think 99@@ .@@ 9 would about cover it .
and finally , it &apos;s the freedom that america represents , not just to me , as an im@@ migr@@ ant , but to everyone in the world . thank you .
you build plat@@ forms for self-@@ expression and collabor@@ ation .
the same type of mark@@ -up , like ma@@ th@@ m@@ l , for chemistry .
and on day six , they basically thre@@ w in the to@@ we@@ l .
i get this sort of un@@ re@@ qu@@ est@@ ed -- by me anyway -- visit , and sitting in my conference room is a very sen@@ ior surgeon from the military and the guy that r@@ uns dar@@ pa .
now , if you &apos;d wai@@ ted , if you &apos;d wai@@ ted for one more year , you would have heard this .
the world needs this kind of exper@@ ti@@ se , and it re@@ wards the kind of people willing to ac@@ qui@@ re it .
because we kind of have to -- we &apos;re just comp@@ elled to .
this was the first experim@@ ental evidence that the big bang exi@@ sted and the universe was born at a preci@@ se moment some 14@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago .
haw@@ ken ful@@ filled business and industry , leading human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with continued un@@ che@@ cked decline of the biosphere , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here -- fran@@ k@@ ly , an un@@ ac@@ cept@@ able risk .
and he refer@@ red me to this lo@@ vely quote from the japanese &quot; es@@ says in i@@ d@@ len@@ ess &quot; from the 14@@ th century , in which the es@@ sa@@ y@@ ist wrote , &quot; in everything , uni@@ formi@@ ty is un@@ desi@@ r@@ able .
but they just don &apos;t seem to get through .
one out of every four people lo@@ cked up anywhere in the world is lo@@ cked up right here in the united states .
but if you look closely , they &apos;re not fighting a global ji@@ had .
they &apos;ll get an incredible pan@@ or@@ ama and understand , i think more completely , the she@@ er tot@@ ality of the destru@@ ction of the place .
and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
archite@@ cts tend to work with signature , so that an archite@@ ct needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of hou@@ ses up to , say , sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers , and that problem of sig@@ nat@@ ures is a thing we &apos;re very good at main@@ taining and working with ; and intri@@ c@@ acy , which is the relationship of , say , the shape of a building , its structure , its windows , its color , its pattern . these are real architectural problems .
the appli@@ cations in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-@@ we@@ tting .
i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conser@@ vation business , and they -- i asked them , &quot; so what &apos;s one issue you would like everyone to know more about ? &quot;
you do it in your s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers .
we also have a program already called google gr@@ ants that now ser@@ ves over 150 different chari@@ ties around the world , and these are some of the chari@@ ties that are on there .
just keep in mind that ac@@ quir@@ ing pre@@ emp@@ tive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to en@@ sure that we have a say in the making of our future .
what the li@@ kes of sebastian are starting to ri@@ ght@@ fully ask is , shouldn &apos;t they own their repu@@ tation data ?
now , this is the very interesting part .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know ; i &apos;ll have to think about that . &quot;
one is hierarchi@@ cal por@@ es , and the other is a ma@@ cro@@ -@@ molecular nan@@ o@@ scale po@@ ro@@ sity in the material .
and there &apos;s this mental de@@ light that &apos;s follo@@ wed by the physical response of laugh@@ ter , which , not co@@ inci@@ d@@ entally , rele@@ ases end@@ orph@@ ins in the brain .
just a little to@@ y . which leads me to the next thing , which is -- what have i got here ? ok . all right .
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans mat@@ ing ? &quot;
pop qui@@ z : when does learning begin ? answer : before we are born . science writer an@@ nie mur@@ ph@@ y paul talks through new research that shows how much we learn in the wom@@ b -- from the li@@ lt of our native language to our so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be@@ -@@ favorite fo@@ ods .
i connected high speed internet to it -- it &apos;s about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there .
in the garden , adam and eve are materi@@ ally content .
now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profi@@ le and our social media accoun@@ ts after we die .
did you know that about her ?
&quot; they &apos;re really watching us , and we can &apos;t help but worry that we &apos;re not going to live up to their expe@@ c@@ tations . &quot;
after all , they are the most per@@ is@@ hab@@ le of their kind , pr@@ one to in@@ j@@ ury and very slow to he@@ al due to our health care system .
prin@@ im@@ a was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg , and she travel@@ ed 12 hours by train to come to the clin@@ ic to be fit with a kne@@ e , and while all of the am@@ pu@@ te@@ es who wear our kne@@ es affect us as the designers , she &apos;s particularly mean@@ ing@@ ful to me as an engineer and as a woman , because she was in school , she had just started school to study engineering .
ga@@ il couldn &apos;t come .
what &apos;s going on in the u.s. government ?
and that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
fragi@@ le democra@@ cies is the bei@@ ge color .
but je@@ ffer@@ son wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
the one that this step is en@@ ab@@ ling us to do is coming next .
this is the first st@@ unt woman , ro@@ sie ven@@ ger , an amazing woman .
but you can get on a ger@@ man ice train and make it almost to alb@@ ani@@ a .
it &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
it &apos;s called oxytocin .
and we have to find a way to create , in the generation of those alive today , a sense of gener@@ a@@ tional mission .
how much of the money is going into con@@ cre@@ te and boo@@ sting consumption , not into sol@@ ving the really profound problems we have to solve .
give me comfort , give me edge .
now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but i think for ted you are .
why , without them , you &apos;d be a total stran@@ ger . &quot;
and so i &apos;m listening and i &apos;m listening , and at some point , i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
when they make a profit it is thei@@ rs to keep , not for the chi@@ ef to sequ@@ e@@ ster it from them .
this film has no copyright .
sometimes she would see a teen@@ age boy sitting on the hood of the car .
now , here &apos;s the experiment we did , and i would hope this is going to convin@@ ce you that &quot; yeah , right ! &quot; was not the right response .
several life@@ times , actually .
the result is that what kil@@ ls you is not the virus directly , but your own imm@@ une system over@@ re@@ acting , saying , &quot; whatever this is so foreign i &apos;m going ber@@ ser@@ k . &quot;
but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel .
either way , mosquitos find us in the dark by s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing us out . they smell us .
we need better plan@@ ning and systems for ev@@ acu@@ ation .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economi@@ cs sum@@ mit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
and he said , &quot; no , never , john , never .
make these better , because we can afford them . &quot;
they &apos;re so poor , and they are free@@ zing with blan@@ kets during the rain@@ y seas@@ on , in the shel@@ ters built by the u.@@ n@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a plastic she@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the trees , and just like this .
this is the first re@@ co@@ very ever obser@@ ved of volun@@ tary leg movement after an experim@@ ental le@@ sion of the spinal cor@@ d leading to complete and per@@ man@@ ent paral@@ ysi@@ s .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; we have a dream . &quot; he said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
this is no longer an issue of si@@ ci@@ li@@ ans from pal@@ er@@ mo and new york .
the first person to do this systemati@@ cally was lin@@ na@@ e@@ us , car@@ l von l@@ inn@@ e , a swe@@ dish bot@@ an@@ ist , who in the ei@@ gh@@ te@@ ent@@ h century took it upon himself to categ@@ ori@@ ze every living organ@@ ism on the planet .
look in your heart , actually .
i asked her about her wish , and she said , &quot; you know , maybe i &apos;ll live , maybe i &apos;ll die , but i don &apos;t have a wish . &quot;
a lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem .
give power to designers .
and it is a most edi@@ fying form of inst@@ ant gra@@ tifi@@ cation .
to get the symmetri@@ cal shape of the horse was very difficult , because i had to get the horse to re@@ ar up and look as though it was in some kind of action .
and in fact , were so successful at this that it t@@ opp@@ ed twitter for two weeks .
that &apos;s what people did then , speaking like writing .
they &apos;re being jud@@ ged also , and the jud@@ ges are trained to give no non@@ verb@@ al feed@@ back , so they look like this . like , imagine this is the person intervie@@ wing you .
now , these stories are great examples of how photograph@@ y can be used to address some of our most important t@@ opi@@ cs .
that &apos;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tas@@ ks .
so the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work finan@@ cially , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
thank you very much .
and so that gives you an idea of how ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely sensi@@ tive this is .
surgeon and author sher@@ win nu@@ land disc@@ us@@ ses the development of electro@@ sho@@ ck therapy as a cure for sever@@ e , life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening depression -- including his own . it &apos;s a moving and hear@@ t@@ felt talk about re@@ lief , re@@ de@@ mp@@ tion and second chan@@ ces .
all of this information is rela@@ tively available .
you care about science , philosop@@ h@@ y , music , art , whatever -- it &apos;s no good if you &apos;re a z@@ om@@ bie or in a com@@ a , right ?
okay , so i want to show you just two more inter@@ faces , because i think one of our big challenges is re-@@ imag@@ ining our relationship to natural systems , not only through this model of twi@@ sted person@@ alized health , but through the animals with who@@ m we co@@ hab@@ it .
i would probably park in front of the other one .
this is a device which is inten@@ ded to reduce the phenomenon of ga@@ ze down to the sim@@ pl@@ est possible materials .
it also aff@@ or@@ ds us cheap fabri@@ cation , which is fantastic , so it means that you can do a lot more with it .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
but these are people who have been radi@@ c@@ alized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation .
and this difference in time between the two is the early dete@@ ction , the early war@@ ning we can get , about an im@@ pen@@ ding epidemi@@ c in the human population .
and then we will need another 10 , 15 years with space projects to get the spec@@ tra of earth@@ -like planets like the one i showed you .
this is the way children are rais@@ ed proper@@ ly .
so it was always the sa@@ ti@@ ri@@ st , like ju@@ ven@@ al or mar@@ tial , repres@@ ented the audience , and he was going to make fun of the out@@ si@@ der , the person who didn &apos;t share that subject status .
if you go back to the map at night , you can get a clu@@ e to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in china .
this open@@ ed up a whole new world of possibilities for me , and after playing with the software development k@@ it a little bit , i made a couple apps , i made some test apps .
for those who live on the main@@ land , it was tough being away from home .
because this seems like a national issue , but it is not .
mental ro@@ tation is a task where i &apos;m going to ask you , and again you &apos;re going to do the task , to look at this shape . study it , it &apos;s a target shape , and i &apos;m going to present to you four different shapes .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollu@@ tion .
nothing &apos;s been di@@ lu@@ ted .
it &apos;s not giving me my last two pi@@ es . i &apos;m going to give up .
so what are the appli@@ cations ?
that &apos;s a rate of 7@@ ,@@ 2@@ 5@@ 6 children &apos;s lives saved each day .
i want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things .
and we &apos;ll extend it to the rural cent@@ ers and make it aff@@ ord@@ able .
and the dream was cru@@ shed .
literature allowed him to tran@@ sc@@ end his surro@@ und@@ ings .
now , i agree that you have to -- yeah , there are certain conc@@ es@@ sions and , you know , if you use a slide proje@@ ctor , you &apos;re not able to have the bad type s@@ wing in from the back or the side , or up or down , but maybe that &apos;s an o@@ .@@ k. tra@@ de-@@ off , to trade that off for a focus .
differ@@ en@@ cing is another techni@@ que we use .
and this changes everything .
the light that the flu@@ or@@ escence e@@ mi@@ ts can go through tissue .
so , this woman , who conver@@ ted from the church of england to ca@@ tholi@@ ci@@ sm when she married my father -- and there &apos;s no one more rab@@ id than a ca@@ tholic conver@@ t -- decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria , particularly among ig@@ bo women , the bil@@ l@@ ings o@@ v@@ u@@ lation meth@@ od , which was the only appro@@ ved birth control by the ca@@ tholic church .
it &apos;s one of those ideas that &apos;s so simple , yet brilliant , you wonder why it &apos;s never been done before .
and like children , they believe that we are in sever@@ e need of assi@@ stance .
then , this fau@@ c@@ et here is just a piece of o@@ sage orange .
but well before my imagination was my vo@@ cation , my imagination saved my life .
when the second group of children came in , they were brought to the same room , shown the same an@@ a@@ grams , but this time miss smi@@ th told them which an@@ a@@ grams to do and which mark@@ ers to write their answers with .
here &apos;s my multi@@ ver@@ se creatures .
it &apos;s called &quot; heli@@ os &quot; -- heli@@ os from the sun .
i don &apos;t look like a motor vehicle .
one group of people just met for an h@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half once a week in a support group .
i &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
we po@@ pul@@ ated all the ecolo@@ gi@@ es .
they are highly re@@ active , and they are super@@ -@@ plastic , and so the au@@ ti@@ sts are probably capable of building and learning a sym@@ ph@@ ony which is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for us .
so they have to also disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate between these products .
and so for@@ give the molecules on the screen , but these are a very simple k@@ it .
working families , which are defined as ear@@ ning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in america are spending more now on transportation than on h@@ ous@@ ing , slightly more , because of this phenomenon called &quot; drive till you quali@@ fy , &quot; finding homes further and further and further from the city cent@@ ers and from their jobs , so that they &apos;re lo@@ cked in this , two , three hours , four hours a day of com@@ mu@@ ting .
there is a pro@@ c@@ ession of sy@@ ll@@ ables -- whe@@ at , one ; pra@@ i@@ ries , two ; lost swe@@ de to@@ w@@ ns , three -- one , two , three .
rob dun@@ bar : discover@@ ing ancient cli@@ mat@@ es in oceans and ice
and how many people have actually seen a live pi@@ g producing this meat ?
what you need to do is first of all tell people that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day , fir@@ st-@@ class mail .
what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called b@@ ou@@ ba , and which is called ki@@ ki .
so it went on like that , and i didn &apos;t know where else to find myself .
you use this thing and you don &apos;t get there . well , imagine if your belie@@ fs gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee you can never get to where you want to go ?
well it &apos;s no secret that computers , through mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are spee@@ ding up faster and faster .
all religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
but more importantly , see , i passed no jud@@ gment on her , because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on her@@ self .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profi@@ table .
well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
you have these rapidly emerging bike lan@@ es all over the world . i lived in manhattan for 15 years .
which means we have been asking the wrong question .
there is no cen@@ su@@ s on bu@@ ll@@ ying and dat@@ ing ab@@ use and eating dis@@ orders and cu@@ tting and ra@@ pe -- no cen@@ su@@ s .
this is a project that had its in@@ ception 15 years ago when our team then -- we called the institute ti@@ g@@ r -- was involved in sequen@@ cing the first two genom@@ es in history .
and if you clo@@ sed your eyes you &apos;d be able to ment@@ ally navi@@ gate it .
the sound around us is affe@@ cting us even though we &apos;re not conscious of it .
here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
r@@ w : ... sort of had a f@@ ame . his f@@ ame was built on that in l.a. for a while .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simpli@@ fied version of what i &apos;m talking about .
now here &apos;s the ki@@ cker .
any one of the win@@ es served at this ta@@ sting , if i &apos;d been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my life@@ time , and incredibly memor@@ able .
and i began to think , i wonder what it would be like to start imag@@ ining myself as if energy and information were the two things i had as in@@ put -- as if food and information were similar in some form or shape .
fortunately , nobody has harv@@ est@@ ed any penguins and we &apos;re getting over 100,000 touri@@ sts a year to see them .
i happen to have tri@@ ple@@ ts .
then the last game i did was based on trying to get the video game industry and hollywood to actually work together on something -- instead of li@@ cen@@ sing from each other , to actually work .
and i happened to have a friend who was over , and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you just wait . &quot;
it &apos;s exactly the same in this context .
because for me , to join the b to the e , i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way , and start thinking about the long , long line from b to e .
and play a little ban@@ jo . let &apos;s do a little me@@ d@@ ley .
probably starting with spor@@ ts games , which are going to become much more inter@@ active .
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters . it really matters .
we &apos;re oper@@ ating outside the bo@@ unds of co2 con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tions that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
and i realized it had to come from the people .
he told himself it was necessary to make them from sc@@ rat@@ ch .
and i thought , &quot; oh gra@@ ci@@ ous , if these two players , either one of them &quot; -- they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there -- &quot; oh , if he ever makes the var@@ sity , our var@@ sity must be pretty miser@@ able , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot;
i am an emotional , i am an emotional , in@@ con@@ do@@ tional , de@@ vo@@ tional creature .
by building together open , free , se@@ cure systems , we can go around such sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
i said , &quot; well , he &apos;s passed away , but his name was k@@ ho@@ sr@@ o . &quot;
now all of this has been tremendous for the world .
you sh@@ out . you say , &quot; blah blah blah , blah blah blah . who is this guy ? &quot;
next step in my process .
and when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; why would i con@@ cei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;
step four is i then move the re@@ te , move the sky , so the altitude of the star cor@@ respon@@ ds to the scale on the back .
you know , sometimes people say that something isn &apos;t ro@@ cket science .
and then they both laugh@@ ed . &quot; ha , ha , ha . &quot;
thank you .
linear : take , make , waste .
but the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking .
sh@@ y but ambi@@ ti@@ ous pi@@ g farmers , however , can pur@@ ch@@ ase a -- this is true -- a so@@ w vi@@ br@@ ator , that han@@ gs on the sper@@ m fee@@ der tube to vibra@@ te .
this robot is actually a family of s@@ na@@ ke robots that we call hy@@ dr@@ as , hy@@ per degre@@ es@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ freedom robo@@ tic arti@@ cul@@ ated ser@@ p@@ ent@@ ine .
we think that might have something to do with re@@ ag@@ an .
here it is : &quot; this island earth . &quot;
actually , i put mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in everything i coo@@ ked -- -- and i had access to all the best girls . it was fab@@ ul@@ ous .
it &apos;s for this reason that the global com@@ mission on hiv and the law , of which i &apos;m a member , was establi@@ shed by the agen@@ cies of the united nations -- to look at the ways that legal environ@@ ments are affe@@ cting people living with hiv and those at greatest risk , and to re@@ com@@ mend what should be done to make the law an ally , not an ene@@ my , of the global response to hiv .
but it &apos;s a hard process to do because , as you know , the middle of a star is quite hot , almost by definition .
thank you .
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
what &apos;s next ? what is going to be the next change ?
what do you bring to it ?
we will be able to see the vel@@ o@@ city of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy &apos;s going or stopp@@ ing .
it didn &apos;t de@@ cre@@ ase its prefer@@ red speed at all .
that was so exciting . and then the eg@@ g divi@@ ded again .
but i wasn &apos;t worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion caus@@ ing the destru@@ ction of the planet .
that &apos;s the t@@ wel@@ f@@ th one .
i don &apos;t have to remind you of all the hy@@ pe that was involved with the internet -- like ge@@ tri@@ ch@@ .com .
in north america , we call this astro@@ tur@@ fing , and astro@@ tur@@ fing is very common now . there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s about it .
so this is where this little de@@ ar comes into play .
i was born in calcu@@ tt@@ a -- a family where my father and his father before him were journali@@ sts , and they wrote magaz@@ ines in the english language .
here &apos;s a completely different effect . this is a painting by b@@ ell@@ ot@@ to .
and those cal@@ ories are in fo@@ ods that cause , not prevent , disease .
all this time you &apos;re -- when you think about hunger , it &apos;s a hard thing to think about , because what we think about is eating .
at our lab ro@@ mel@@ a , the robo@@ tics and mechan@@ isms laborat@@ ory , we have these fantastic brain@@ stor@@ ming ses@@ sions .
i intervie@@ wed , when i was working on the book , i intervie@@ wed a woman who can think her@@ self to or@@ gas@@ m .
what transl@@ ates generi@@ c public space into quali@@ ta@@ tive space ?
and so 27 viol@@ ations -- driving through a red light , driving at ex@@ c@@ es@@ sive speed , driving on the wrong side of a bar@@ rier , and finally , ri@@ ding his bra@@ kes down that hi@@ ll -- redu@@ ced to one .
and 194@@ 7 was a le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y vin@@ tage , especially in the right bank of bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
i am a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . student and that means i have a question : how can we make digital content gras@@ p@@ able ?
another consequ@@ ence of this recent ori@@ gin of modern humans is that genetic vari@@ ants are generally distribu@@ ted wid@@ ely in the world , in many places , and they tend to v@@ ary as gra@@ di@@ ents , from a bird &apos;@@ s-@@ eye perspective at least .
breast density re@@ fers to the relative amount of fat -- pi@@ ctu@@ red here in yellow -- versus conne@@ ctive and epi@@ the@@ li@@ al tis@@ su@@ es -- pi@@ ctu@@ red in pin@@ k .
but , you can di@@ m down the light to a level that it appe@@ ars to be off .
so for example , i created more work for the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers by putting out a pi@@ le of to@@ oth@@ pi@@ cks near the nest ent@@ ran@@ ce , early in the morning when the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers are first active .
that would be a huge , vast me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan area , probably much larger than the city of victori@@ a .
but compassion is also equ@@ ally at home in the se@@ cular as in the religious .
so , if we are to be the world &apos;s heal@@ er , every disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ged person in this world -- including in the united states -- becomes our patient .
and i would like to do it in such a way that i don &apos;t actually have to be able to read the language , because i &apos;m sure i won &apos;t be able to .
you are somebody who wants to see a better world .
today &apos;s dance world is not defined sol@@ ely by the ro@@ y@@ al win@@ ni@@ pe@@ g bal@@ let or the national bal@@ let of canada , but by li@@ z ler@@ man &apos;s dance exchange -- a multi@@ -@@ gener@@ a@@ tional , professional dance company , whose dan@@ cers range in age from 18 to 8@@ 2 , and who work with genomi@@ c scientists to em@@ body the dna str@@ and and with nuclear physi@@ ci@@ sts at c@@ ern .
aren &apos;t those negative emotions , or destru@@ ctive emotions , inher@@ ent to the nature of mind ?
and by doing so , we can differ@@ enti@@ ate the surfaces .
and these were created without sk@@ et@@ ches , just free@@ hand , by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then mani@@ pul@@ ating it to get the words and designs out of it .
it was my mother lea@@ ving , just at the moment that i was being born .
remember that children &apos;s book where you sha@@ ke and the sexu@@ ality of the parents change ?
i used a microscop@@ ic sh@@ ard of diam@@ ond to actually car@@ ve the actual base .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cle@@ an@@ ing , buying things , sh@@ opp@@ ing , building . but they aren &apos;t here .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
so any of the hospi@@ t@@ als interested can come along , read the nice report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves .
in china for example , one mi@@ d-@@ level emplo@@ ye@@ e initi@@ ated the largest social action competi@@ tion in china , invol@@ ving more than 1,000 schools in china , working on issues such as education , poverty , health care and the environment .
and then i go and have some tea .
why is it that i &apos;m okay with losing and why is it that i think that good argu@@ ers are actually better at losing ?
they have the lo@@ west child mortality in the world , sing@@ apo@@ re .
and he didn &apos;t just leave it , he cir@@ cl@@ ed it once .
we &apos;ve had a lot of -- a par@@ ade of amazing ideas here .
and of course it will be hu@@ gely dis@@ rup@@ tive in prepar@@ ation plans .
environmental consider@@ ation was served with every pla@@ te , but it was served with a he@@ ap@@ ing mo@@ und of consider@@ ation for human interests at the same time .
and it &apos;s very important to have political re@@ forms , to have wid@@ ely shared benefits of economic growth .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
every week the number one be@@ st-@@ s@@ elling d@@ v@@ d in america changes .
you &apos;ve heard that word several times in the last four days , and everyone &apos;s familiar with ku@@ h@@ ni@@ an paradig@@ ms .
and the second goal , for those of us who have master@@ ed that first goal , is to -- you know , you call it spiritual ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment , you can call it financial success , you can call it any number of different things .
and those are the specific genes that diff@@ er from one to the other .
so thank you all and i love them .
it &apos;s the same pattern at many different sc@@ ales .
this ar@@ o@@ se indepen@@ d@@ ently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another .
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the el@@ der@@ ly , the happy extreme , are the new guinea far@@ ming societies where i &apos;ve been doing my fiel@@ d@@ work for the past 50 years , and most other se@@ d@@ entary traditional societies around the world .
here is a lu@@ mp of fl@@ es@@ h , about three pounds , which you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand .
it &apos;s literally defin@@ ing a new field .
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all gene@@ ti@@ cally identical , but they diff@@ er from each other based on their ti@@ ps , on one sequ@@ ence that co@@ des for one protein .
people , service , profit .
and if anyone should be cl@@ inging to the for@@ mer gl@@ ory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be ju@@ dy .
after that day , everyone in the fa@@ vel@@ a gave me the green light .
it &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
the first is , forget about ki@@ cking . very counter@@ intui@@ tive .
basically zi@@ p@@ car is the largest car@@ -@@ sharing company in the world .
&quot; i &apos;m with the little la@@ dy . dam@@ n ! &quot;

and as the sand@@ stone wea@@ thers , new gra@@ ins break free .
you can ask the question , &quot; who &apos;s the bo@@ ss ? &quot;
meant to be a way to in@@ centi@@ vi@@ ze inven@@ tion , meant to be a way to or@@ ch@@ est@@ rate the dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation of knowledge , they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thi@@ ck@@ ets of pat@@ ents to prevent innovation taking place .
the other thing that &apos;s kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design , they actually mean st@@ yle .
so countries like au@@ str@@ alia , russia , li@@ by@@ a , ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , could be our best friends for ren@@ e@@ w@@ able production .
and bo@@ yle said , bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it .
he has been very suppor@@ tive of me .
governments and ngos need to ta@@ p into that local entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al talent as well , because the lo@@ c@@ als know how to reach the very har@@ d-@@ to-@@ ser@@ ve places , their neighb@@ ors , and they know what mo@@ tiv@@ ates them to make change .
next , a ur@@ in@@ al was plac@@ ed on its side and called &quot; foun@@ tain &quot; .
&#91; chinese &#93; and everybody &apos;s eyes just pop wide open like it &apos;s going to fall out of their heads .
how should you deli@@ ver your talk ?
and we can aggre@@ gate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nan@@ o-@@ molecular molecules the same size of dna and proteins , but there &apos;s no carbon in sight .
and i &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
maybe this is all wa@@ cky to folks like you , i don &apos;t know .
so we wanted to figure out how these o@@ vari@@ an cancer cells are becoming resi@@ stant to this drug called ci@@ sp@@ la@@ tin .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
we have a big gap in that money . we &apos;re cu@@ tting cor@@ ners , and every time we cut cor@@ ners , more places get infe@@ cted that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slo@@ ws us down .
and the ti@@ lt also explains the sun &apos;s angle of el@@ ev@@ ation at different times of year , and predi@@ cts that the seas@@ ons will be out of phase in the two he@@ mi@@ sp@@ heres .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be up@@ d@@ ated to 2.@@ 0 and we will have cli@@ ck@@ -@@ through pur@@ ch@@ ases of off@@ sets .
and then i asked the usual question : &quot; is it a pri@@ ority ?
it &apos;s my turn .
they still do what they &apos;ve done for ages , their ene@@ mies long gone .
now as you may know , sound tra@@ vels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audi@@ o signal , transform it into a vibra@@ tion , which is then transpor@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tured by our e@@ ar , and transformed into an audi@@ o signal again .
and we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source -- saying , &quot; hey , we want to track down the source . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what i do -- op@@ tical mind control .
that &apos;s a pattern .
it means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of california -- every person , that &apos;s more or less what we have today in the world .
but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mc@@ don@@ al@@ d &apos;s is its fran@@ chi@@ sees .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot;
now , malaria is of course trans@@ mitted by mosquitos .
ok , we &apos;ll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
should they come forward , that would be a tri@@ cky situation for us , but we &apos;re pres@@ um@@ ably acting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ elled to continue our mission , not to scre@@ w it up .
but that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
and the key idea to ba@@ ye@@ si@@ an in@@ ference is you have two sources of information from which to make your in@@ ference .
this under@@ water key@@ board in or@@ land@@ o , florida , at the ep@@ co@@ t center , was actually the most sophi@@ sti@@ cated ever two-@@ way interface designed for humans and dolph@@ ins to work together under the water and exchange information .
so is that wrong ?
and i &apos;m standing there with two te@@ sti@@ cles on my ch@@ in .
they deser@@ ve a hand .
so while the doctors continued to oper@@ ate and put my body back together again , i went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amaz@@ ingly , i passed my pilot &apos;s medical , and that was my green light to fly .
so these patterns of char@@ ges are not just pretty .
and so , in many of our courses , the medi@@ an response time for a question on the question and answer for@@ um was 2@@ 2 minutes .
and then 80 percent of the world already e@@ ats insects , so we are just a min@@ ority -- in a country like the u.k. , the usa , the ne@@ ther@@ lands , anywhere .
and from this moment , classi@@ cal music became what it most essentially is , a dialo@@ gue between the two powerful si@@ des of our nature : instin@@ ct and intelligence .
etc . , etc . -- is that enough for simul@@ cast ? ok , sorry .
there &apos;s actually 4@@ 6@@ ,000 images right now on my site , and the f@@ bi has seen all of them -- at least i trust they &apos;ve seen all of them .
if we cut all the complexity away , we have the problem of scale .
&quot; que ? &quot; which means &quot; what , &quot; and so much more .
but most important , i was left with these three burning questions that wouldn &apos;t go away : how did this happen to me if i was sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly doing everything right ?
and i said , &quot; you know what ? these app@@ les come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
and so let &apos;s fly back in time to that memor@@ able moment .
it &apos;s built as a bar@@ n rais@@ ing , using open source hardware .
it didn &apos;t happen in tier@@ ra del fu@@ e@@ go -- similar island , similar people .
and i &apos;m a very small part of this .
and so what we did is , we take tissue culture cells and infe@@ ct them with various viruses , and we take the stuff and flu@@ or@@ es@@ cently lab@@ el the nu@@ c@@ lei@@ c ac@@ id , the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells -- mostly vi@@ ral stuff -- and stick it on the ar@@ ray to see where it sticks .
he started invent@@ ing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge using a bi@@ cycle whe@@ el .
so let me conclu@@ de with just a re@@ mark to bring it back to the the@@ me of choices .
this is a fi@@ ve-@@ level bridge in shanghai .
let me explain to you how i &apos;m going to attempt this problem .
and , you know , this kind of head cover@@ ing is extremely glam@@ or@@ ous because , like sun@@ glasses , it con@@ ce@@ als and reve@@ als at the same time .
and these are elections by the people , for the people .
so just imagine how many man@@ -@@ months or man@@ -@@ years are wa@@ sted , just like i wa@@ sted a day .
because it &apos;s not fail@@ ure itself that con@@ stra@@ ins us .
i began &quot; the vagina mon@@ olo@@ gues &quot; because i was worried about vagin@@ as .
and together we would tre@@ k a thousand kilome@@ ters across india .
high falls , they &apos;re old fashi@@ oned stun@@ ts .
instead , the context , the common ground ac@@ tivi@@ ties , are the content on television that &apos;s driving the conver@@ sations .
it &apos;s coming from us .
now i am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
i &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5,000 bri@@ cks in one day from the dir@@ t bene@@ ath my feet and built a tra@@ ctor in six days .
prime minister , i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreci@@ ative of the eff@@ or@@ ts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into .
if it &apos;s not picked up by a human , like me and you , it &apos;ll stay there for thousands and thousands of years .
data : a couple of new jer@@ sey h@@ unter@@ s are out in the woods .
all that you see is a kid in his te@@ ens who started out in a garage with only a bud@@ dy named wo@@ z .
and it re@@ minds us of the a@@ im@@ less nature of clou@@ d@@ spo@@ tting , what an a@@ im@@ less activity it is .
when in@@ tel does sur@@ ve@@ ys all around the world and we say , &quot; quick response : heal@@ th@@ care . &quot;
i want to de@@ but a new song that i &apos;ve been working on in the last five or six months .
and what design off@@ ers as an educational fra@@ me@@ work is an anti@@ do@@ te to all of the bor@@ ing , ri@@ gi@@ d , verb@@ al instru@@ ction that so many of these school distri@@ cts are pla@@ gu@@ ed by .
it was just , &quot; because i say so .
so i could do more lar@@ ge-@@ scale projects .
but it &apos;s ser@@ ving millions for the best .
it &apos;s not just that it was res@@ ur@@ re@@ cted . it &apos;s continued all along .
there have been many epi@@ so@@ des , and actually e@@ ames de@@ metri@@ us may be here in the audience , but in two in@@ stances , his great@@ -@@ grandfather , grandfather -- i &apos;m always a little per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed about the relation , exactly -- charles e@@ ames the first time and then charles and ray e@@ ames the second time were involved in two competi@@ tions : one in 19@@ 40 , it was about organic furniture , and the second one in 194@@ 8 was low-@@ cost furniture for the g@@ is coming back from the war that then spar@@ ked a whole line of furniture .
the simple pro@@ posal is that we should have some international standards , which will be volun@@ tary , but which would sp@@ ell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to har@@ ness these resource reven@@ u@@ es .
and it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per bri@@ ck to take their cities apart .
in china , recycl@@ ing is a major issue .
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the poll@@ ing sta@@ tions , it was impossible for that premi@@ er to fix that ele@@ ction in the way that he wanted to do .
girl 4 : i wouldn &apos;t like it .
you can see this for yourself on our website .
i &apos;ve spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called biolumin@@ escence .
and appar@@ ently , he di@@ so@@ be@@ yed god , and that &apos;s the ultimate di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence to auth@@ ority .
now look at the one right below that .
it &apos;s considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
the problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blocks , it &apos;s neither fun nor effi@@ cient nor produ@@ ctive .
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had an@@ ter@@ o@@ grade am@@ ne@@ sia . these are hospi@@ tali@@ zed patients .
when we first started this kind of work , politi@@ cians would stand up , tre@@ as@@ ury spo@@ k@@ es@@ men would stand up , and accu@@ se us of wanting to go back and live in ca@@ ves .
it &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
not just are we ab@@ sent from it , but so is everyone else .
and so the state can come in .
as vi@@ ck@@ i arro@@ yo says , it &apos;s time to pre@@ p@@ are our homes and cities for our changing climate , with its increased risk of f@@ loo@@ ding , dr@@ ought and un@@ certain@@ ty . she illu@@ str@@ ates this inspi@@ ring talk with b@@ old projects from cities all over the world -- local examples of thinking ahead . &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; h@@ tt@@ p : / / ww@@ w@@ .@@ ted@@ .com / conver@@ sations / 14@@ 18@@ 6 / live _ ch@@ at _ with _ ted _ speaker _ vi@@ c@@ .@@ ht@@ m@@ l &quot; &amp; gt ; read our q &amp; amp ; a with vi@@ ck@@ i arro@@ yo . &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ;

older americans are at a big disa@@ d@@ van@@ tage in job appli@@ cations .
the other as@@ sumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make as@@ sump@@ tions .
and i heard the ex@@ act same pun@@ ch@@ line on both co@@ a@@ sts -- something about the i@@ gni@@ ted ne@@ gr@@ o college fund .
it is an effici@@ ency measure .
text : in another 30 minutes they would reach the theory of rela@@ tivity . and then ?
and the result is the ter@@ ra@@ fu@@ gia transition .
so you see the le@@ af@@ lets opening and clo@@ sing -- of this heart valve that &apos;s currently being used experim@@ entally to try to get it to further studies .
they were doing an experiment to do with gene@@ tics and the for@@ eli@@ m@@ bs and the h@@ ind lim@@ bs of animals .
and also it would allow us to have the ultra@@ -@@ preci@@ se control we need in order to fix the circu@@ it compu@@ tations that have gone aw@@ ry .
and certainly , no , it doesn &apos;t look a thing like my office .
and the whole project of understanding how brains do the uni@@ qu@@ ely human things -- learn language and abstract concepts , and thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts -- that &apos;s brand new .
it &apos;s the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so anim@@ ates you , so mo@@ ves you , that something even like cancer becomes in@@ significant .
alli@@ son h@@ unt : my three minutes has@@ n &apos;t started yet , has it ?
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , spe@@ ech@@ less .
we don &apos;t think about it a lot , and unfortunately , we actually don &apos;t even think about buildings , i think , as much as we should .
anyway , the three boys came in -- four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds with tea to@@ wel@@ s on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , &quot; i bring you gold . &quot;
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been . i know i &apos;m not what i ought to be , not what i should be . but i think i &apos;m better than i would have been if i hadn &apos;t run across certain things .
why do we have 11 aircraft car@@ ri@@ ers ?
i can &apos;t flip it because i &apos;ve put a little twi@@ st on it , haven &apos;t i ?
&quot; tell a lie ; it was di@@ ana ross ... &quot;
the first job that he ever got in the sa@@ far@@ i business was fix@@ ing the sa@@ far@@ i trucks .
you think , what should i do ?
nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
the first building i built was 20 years ago .
and i found these ma@@ ps which you see here .
we &apos;ve seen how distribu@@ ted networks , big data and information can transform society .
and leave it to hollywood to get it just right .
i &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea bill , because of this report . &quot;
what we &apos;re interested in is developing robots like this -- and here are two other pictures -- of robots that you can buy off the shelf .
but we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that co@@ verage .
not many people check boxes .
ar@@ man@@ i -- who said ar@@ man@@ i ? you ?
if i stand be@@ side that truck , my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hu@@ b@@ cap .
now here at ted , over the last couple of days , i &apos;ve seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible .
transportation walls came tum@@ bling down .
and so they &apos;re holding off until they get a deal with them .
now , the average house has about 300 mega@@ watt hours of em@@ bo@@ died energy in it ; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper to@@ wel@@ s .
so here &apos;s a photo which resol@@ ves to st. pe@@ ter@@ sbur@@ g .
i don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ post@@ or .
how do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don &apos;t have a moral fra@@ me@@ work ?
and where &apos;s the air@@ time sold ?
when that happens , it is a trend which is set to over@@ wh@@ el@@ m our poli@@ cing capacity in the west .
and it was just , it was amazing , because these guys are high-@@ fi@@ ving him over how good i turned out , you know ?
so , i &apos;ll leave you with these cli@@ ps to have a look .
we &apos;re not lo@@ cked into co@@ operation the way bees and ants are .
so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in , and using the sp@@ are soil that &apos;s there on the site , we could make a power station that was silent as well .
and a lot of people might use structures like ab@@ alone sh@@ ells , like ch@@ al@@ k .
we want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of tel@@ evi@@ sions , as op@@ posed to in front of human beings .
they found themselves pre@@ gn@@ ant .
rather , africa was dr@@ ying out at that time .
and so i came up with a life box , because i needed a deli@@ very system .
if the horse was in pain , i wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
or should we use something else ?
this is the starting point for desig@@ ning a battery -- two electro@@ des , in this case met@@ als of different com@@ position , and an electro@@ ly@@ te , in this case s@@ alt dis@@ sol@@ ved in water .
those things really exist .
and all ant coloni@@ es have in common that there &apos;s no central control .
and one of them was &#91; unclear &#93; who taught us physics .
you can &apos;t be smart and pretty .
so that &apos;s where i want to begin my little explor@@ ation , is in life .
and then it is 40 feet deep .
and in propor@@ tion , what would the size of the sphere and the length , and what would the ta@@ per be to the earth ?
bf : nice show , daniel , nice show . you are the man !
and that &apos;s not what the de@@ ba@@ te should be about .
and they pass self-@@ awareness tests in mi@@ rr@@ ors .
that used to be the illegal diam@@ ond trade , from the uni@@ ta@@ -@@ dom@@ inated area in an@@ gol@@ a .
so again , it &apos;s not just genes , it &apos;s multiple details -- our hab@@ its , our environmental ex@@ pos@@ ure .
agree that &quot; bo@@ y@@ z n the hood , &quot; like ten@@ ny@@ son , off@@ ers an emotional landscape and a hei@@ ghten@@ ed understanding that work together .
and i said to him , &quot; i know the story .
and some states have differ@@ enti@@ al poli@@ cies , coun@@ ty by coun@@ ty .
after all , i &apos;m one of the green guys : i grew up with hi@@ pp@@ ie parents in a lo@@ g cab@@ in .
but in this country , where the government appar@@ ently does not feel comp@@ elled to provide health care for citizens , we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
our actions change the environment , or context , and these changes are then f@@ ed back into the decision loo@@ p .
i had some sugge@@ sti@@ ons to make -- possible new ways of thinking about god .
well , there &apos;s a sense which i agree with him , except i think it has an evolutionary explan@@ ation .
richard ko@@ s@@ hal@@ ek : &#91; unclear &#93; starts from 2004 .
basically they went to the bal@@ lot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
there are many , many examples and i &apos;ll give you one that is not my favorite example : in@@ surance .
i think the human race doesn &apos;t have a future if it doesn &apos;t go into space .
all i need now is to flip on another be@@ am , and the bottom be@@ am is me talking , right ?
it &apos;s used to change the scene .
how do you le@@ verage that information ?
so much of london &apos;s meat was coming from the north@@ west , from scot@@ land and wal@@ es .
it was terri@@ bly dangerous .
why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
the journalist who did &quot; the rise and fall of the third reich . &quot;
we are see@@ king normal human brains .
and i was re@@ minded how u@@ tter@@ ly wrong i am , so much of the time .
you &apos;ve heard of ph@@ an@@ tom limb pain ?
and we thought , let &apos;s make people do it and see what happens .
so , what i know about my movember journey is that , with a really creative idea , with passion , with persi@@ st@@ ence , and a lot of pati@@ ence , four mat@@ es , four mu@@ sta@@ ches , can inspi@@ re a room full of people , and that room full of people can go on and inspi@@ re a city , and that city is mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne , my home .
in addition , we are very com@@ mitted to doing different types of research .
it &apos;s to say we oper@@ ate on two levels .
and i thought i &apos;d start a bar@@ e@@ foot college -- college only for the poor .
i didn &apos;t feel si@@ ck at all .
they &apos;re main@@ taining formation .
when my wife and i had kids , we thought it would be all@@ -@@ hand@@ s-@@ on-@@ de@@ ck .
i hope you &apos;ll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world , and to make your own travel more conveni@@ ent and more fun .
i was a writer .
so this is the princi@@ p@@ al of mind training .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an ir@@ ani@@ an woman and an ir@@ ani@@ an artist , even if i have to oper@@ ate in the west only for now .
and the density is quite incredible .
we did this work in my lab with the dolph@@ ins and eleph@@ ants , and it &apos;s been recently shown in the mag@@ pie .
i think that all of these things are eventually in@@ formed by the core of all of this -- and this is nothing but life itself .
some fru@@ its get some insect damage .
or you get everything invented to yesterday , including facebook and your iphone , but you have to give up , go out to the ou@@ thou@@ se , and carry in the water .
michael &apos;s a young guy .
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laborat@@ ory you may go , to ser@@ ve as teachers during the sp@@ an of your career .
but always with a smile , always with an enthusi@@ as@@ m , that is incredible .
proper@@ ty rights : it &apos;s not the democracy , folks ; it &apos;s having the rule of law based on private proper@@ ty rights .
on that self , it should be cent@@ ered -- a big@@ ness , a wh@@ ol@@ eness .
at the time , there was a lot of op@@ position .
in mani@@ to@@ ba , this is an image from the east side of la@@ ke win@@ ni@@ pe@@ g , and this is the home of the new@@ ly desig@@ nat@@ ed un@@ esc@@ o cultural her@@ i@@ tage site .
and along came the internet and it swe@@ pt them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was a@@ wes@@ ome .
this is a picture of a trainer &apos;s whi@@ stle , a whi@@ stle a trainer will b@@ low to tell a dolphin it &apos;s done the right thing and can come get a fish .
more bor@@ ing , but you still have that kind of colli@@ ding and bu@@ mp@@ ing .
i &apos;ve done my gri@@ ev@@ ing about the loss .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfe@@ ctly .
and in parallel at that time , there was a very kind of ex@@ clu@@ sive design club .
i mean , all of these products succe@@ e@@ ded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren &apos;t expe@@ cting , in a way they didn &apos;t necessarily want , with an ad , over and over and over again until they bought it .
it makes it more organic , more natural .
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
into this mix , people like us , who are not in public office , have more power to do good than at any time in history , because more than half the world &apos;s people live under governments they vot@@ ed in and can vote out .
space squee@@ zes and stre@@ t@@ ches as it e@@ man@@ ates out from these black holes ban@@ ging on the universe .
hard for us to imagine , but in 199@@ 5 , this was the ultimate eli@@ te mobile device .
every technology advan@@ ces .
they love to touch smooth surfaces rather than r@@ ough ones .
that &apos;s less than i used to get just travel@@ ing out for two weeks to do a con@@ sul@@ tation .
well , you know where we &apos;re going on from here .
well , this is the question the edge foundation asked this year , and four of the respon@@ dents said , &quot; seti . &quot;
the second project i want to talk to you about is the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine project .
not solve it like , you know , in ri@@ gor@@ ous fashion , but build a model , an electro@@ -@@ model , using some coordin@@ ates of , you know , length , all that sort of stuff from x-@@ ray photographs .
think of the kids today . their chil@@ d@@ hood &apos;s a bit different .
but what i do hope is that if you remember anything i said or any of my stories tom@@ or@@ row morning over break@@ fast , if you can remember the story of sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo , or the story of r@@ wand@@ a , then i &apos;ve done my job .
a verti@@ cal@@ -@@ ta@@ ke@@ off aircraft is not the sa@@ fest vehicle during the test flight program .
so that was the ideas that i tried to get across to the yo@@ ung@@ sters under my super@@ vision .
do we get to go someday to pe@@ ts &apos; r &apos; us and say , &quot; look , i want a dog .
and brea@@ th@@ ability is good .
and we have actually flo@@ wn this vehicle and lost an engine , and continued to ho@@ ver .
well , i became a ta@@ pe@@ stry histori@@ an .
like my next lin@@ k , the almost ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble lin@@ k , ham the astro@@ ch@@ im@@ p .
since the model t , most people never travel@@ ed more than 25 miles from home in their entire life@@ time .
it &apos;s okay to say rain@@ bo@@ w . yeah .
and i want to say that the head of our aids eff@@ ort , and the person who also is pri@@ mar@@ ily active in the wish i &apos;ll make tonight , ir@@ a magaz@@ in@@ er , is here with me and i want to thank him for everything he &apos;s done .
and on the ma@@ cr@@ o level , we &apos;re in what seems to be a 19@@ -@@ month pre@@ si@@ denti@@ al campaig@@ n , and of all the things we &apos;re asking all of these potential leaders , what about asking for the health of our children ?
today , we &apos;ve seen a 6@@ 3@@ -@@ percent redu@@ ction in mortality from heart disease -- remark@@ ably , 1.@@ 1 million dea@@ ths a@@ ver@@ ted every year .
marketing people have never been able to do that .
so i invented bur@@ la@@ p sa@@ cks , bun@@ ker spa@@ wn -- and putting the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um -- using stor@@ m blo@@ wn de@@ br@@ is , you can take these bur@@ la@@ p sa@@ cks and put them down@@ stream from a farm that &apos;s producing e@@ . coli , or other wa@@ stes , or a factory with chemical to@@ x@@ ins , and it leads to habitat re@@ stor@@ ation .
but his great@@ ness consi@@ sted , and histori@@ ans would ro@@ und@@ ly agree , in the integri@@ ty of his character and the moral fi@@ ber of his being .
you must pur@@ sue that vision . &quot;
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astron@@ omi@@ cal union .
i can do it simul@@ tane@@ ously , where i &apos;m holding this down , and gri@@ pping on another one , stre@@ t@@ ching this out like this .
these machines that came out -- they started coming in the 197@@ 0s -- they would scan human bodies , and they would generate about 100 images of the human body .
but , that &apos;s not true .
and the first lesson , which i think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as ac@@ tivi@@ sm just means ret@@ we@@ eting a p@@ hrase .
there lie the answers to the solution to local ji@@ had .
many years ago , when we first started going out , she was working for the bbc in bri@@ tain , and i was , at that stage , working in america .
when you look at elem@@ ent@@ ar@@ y-@@ school children , we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremend@@ ously from being able to be connected to the internet .
i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-@@ organization .
so hop@@ efully it &apos;s something we can all benefit from .
so i qu@@ it my job ; i went back to banglades@@ h .
like everything you see , every time you wake up .
an infe@@ ction ra@@ va@@ ged my skin .
why not stran@@ gers ?
his vision was to en@@ able man and machine to co@@ oper@@ ate in making decisions , controlling complex situ@@ ations without the in@@ flexible depen@@ dence on pre@@ determined pro@@ grams .
i mean , everybody has their ha@@ z@@ ard .
the director , standing behind the set of shel@@ ves , is going to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s not going to ask you to move objects that he can &apos;t see . this introdu@@ ces a really interesting condi@@ tion wh@@ ere@@ by there &apos;s a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director &apos;s perspective .
all four of my o@@ ars bro@@ ke before i re@@ ached hal@@ f@@ way across .
ss : she &apos;s also saying the name of that , with her voice .
so the theory is that he &apos;s having some imm@@ un@@ ological reaction to what &apos;s going on to the food essentially , and that &apos;s a natural reaction , which causes some program@@ med cell death .
and the way they do it is to give thir@@ d-@@ year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year .
and i said , &quot; yeah , i have one too . &quot;
than@@ k@@ fully , baby was out -- mother and child survived .
but it &apos;s like an experiment . now , before we -- -- before we start , i need to do two things .
we made it into a sa@@ iling craft .
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as cra@@ ig vent@@ er has so elegan@@ tly shown .
but i just thought i &apos;d talk about a moment .
it &apos;s hard to always show compassion -- even to the people we love , but robert th@@ ur@@ man as@@ ks that we develop compassion for our ene@@ mies . he pres@@ cri@@ bes a se@@ ven@@ -@@ step meditation exerci@@ se to extend compassion beyond our inner circle .
are we de@@ cou@@ pl@@ ing money from the government ?
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
well , in order to fly , just as in a human aircraft , you need w@@ ings that can generate suff@@ i@@ cient a@@ ero@@ dynami@@ c forces , you need an engine suff@@ i@@ cient to generate the power requi@@ red for flight , and you need a controll@@ er , and in the first human aircraft , the controll@@ er was basically the brain of or@@ ville and wil@@ bu@@ r sitting in the co@@ ck@@ p@@ it .
other content markets like book publi@@ shing and radio are also up .
the exci@@ tement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a colle@@ ctive of musi@@ cians producing one uni@@ fied whole concept .
and then back@@ track innova@@ tions within that .
you pro@@ ve one , you pro@@ ve the other .
i &apos;m going to talk about a new , old material that still continu@@ es to ama@@ ze us , and that might impact the way we think about material science , high technology -- and maybe , along the way , also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help re@@ for@@ est@@ ation .
so , are these things , how are these things getting here ?
dolph@@ ins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
i &apos;ve just descri@@ bed to you the one story behind that re@@ ct@@ an@@ gu@@ lar area in the middle , the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x islands , but every other green pat@@ ch on that has its own story .
and he says , &quot; well i used to be a ban@@ ker and now i &apos;m a gold min@@ er . &quot;
&quot; well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
our modern world is communi@@ cating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
in fact , we have such amazing life@@ forms that we can manipu@@ late .
and it seems like those dance hero@@ es have disappe@@ ared , sort of rele@@ g@@ ated to the back@@ ground of pop stars and music videos .
on the one hand it pa@@ ys li@@ p service to the idea of re@@ build an effective state in the image of sc@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ via in the 19@@ 50s .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a subur@@ ban las ve@@ gas neighborhood .
this is separate from vitamin d .
and since what &apos;s impossible is always unknown , it allows me to believe i can che@@ at the impossible .
the sa@@ cre@@ d river , the ur@@ u@@ b@@ am@@ ba , or the vil@@ can@@ ota , which is itself the earth@@ ly equi@@ valent of the mi@@ lk@@ y way , but it &apos;s also the tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory that vi@@ ra@@ co@@ cha walked at the da@@ wn of time when he brought the universe into being .
now , it &apos;s not that chemi@@ c@@ als are not important in psychi@@ at@@ ri@@ c dis@@ orders .
but you can also see things underneath there as well .
these are particularly dangerous because there is no m@@ ask on my face .
but again , there were moments , for sure , there were moments of real , hon@@ est@@ -@@ to-@@ god musi@@ cal inter@@ play , for sure .
g@@ b : we have a responsibility to protect .
she has now jo@@ ined a call center in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have tor@@ tured you about your credit card bills in a very clear english ac@@ cent .
there is a book out in the book@@ store -- it &apos;s called &quot; sym@@ ph@@ ony in steel , &quot; and it &apos;s about the stuff that &apos;s hidden under the skin of the disney center .
smile . smile . open the mou@@ ths .
this is a market@@ place , also in ken@@ ya , to@@ i market , lots of de@@ al@@ ers , in almost everything you want to buy .
and as you can see , it gives you a pretty cra@@ pp@@ y performance .
now , the re@@ c@@ ession .
k@@ b : no ?
ro@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ elt gri@@ er , or ro@@ sey gri@@ er , as people used to call him , grew up and grew into a 3@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ und , si@@ x-@@ foot@@ -@@ five line@@ bac@@ ker in the n@@ f@@ l .
now remember here what je@@ ffer@@ son said .
and she said , &quot; listen . the cu@@ t-@@ off date to start kinder@@ garten was september 15 . &quot;
obviously , you &apos;ve got a computer now .
by actually taking the opportunity that new technologies , new inter@@ active technologies , present to re-@@ script our inter@@ actions , to script them , not just as is@@ ol@@ ated , individu@@ ated inter@@ actions , but as colle@@ ctive aggre@@ g@@ ating actions that can amount to something , we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges .
why i am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
i didn &apos;t speak hin@@ di . i &apos;d never been to india . hadn &apos;t a clu@@ e .
and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , &quot; when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragi@@ lity first appe@@ ar ? &quot;
and the kids that you see here all volun@@ te@@ ered to be part of this , 2@@ 8 of them , and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all aff@@ li@@ cted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other .
and now the boys and the girls get them .
and guess what ?
there were several steps to this . there were two si@@ des : we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules , and we had to solve the biological side of how , if we had this new chemical enti@@ ty , how would we boo@@ t it up , activ@@ ate it in a reci@@ pi@@ ent cell .
&apos;@@ i failed ! &apos; he cri@@ ed .
i think glamour has a genu@@ ine appe@@ al , has a genu@@ ine value .
and i am hoping that many of you will respond to this .
in parallel , the folks at mit have been building a standard regi@@ stry of biological parts .
but that sure started me thinking about various things , and immediately , we began making a sol@@ ar-@@ power@@ ed plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world , we didn &apos;t want the small funding in the government to be de@@ cre@@ ased , which is what the government was trying to do with it .
the only difference is that you &apos;ve got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ?
and here we have a game that people play .
nat@@ alie j@@ ere@@ mi@@ jen@@ ko : okay .
the image at the top , what it doesn &apos;t -- if you look at it in detail , really what it is saying is you can wire this building .
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just sm@@ as@@ hing the he@@ ck out of this load cell .
and that builds up on the ev@@ a@@ por@@ ators -- and that &apos;s what that image on the left is -- gradu@@ ally getting en@@ cru@@ sted with the cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate .
and so now we had three age incre@@ ments of benjamin in the computer .
and that was the end of it .
so , initially nothing happens , they &apos;re just fli@@ pping around there .
he was in cy@@ p@@ rus right after the turk@@ ish inv@@ a@@ sion .
is there water on mars ?
ss : are you a different hei@@ ght ?
look -- these genom@@ es , these 23 chromosom@@ es , they don &apos;t in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet .
what if my ro@@ om@@ mate knew about nollywood , full of innova@@ tive people making fil@@ ms despite great technical od@@ ds , fil@@ ms so popular that they really are the best example of nigeri@@ ans con@@ sum@@ ing what they produce ?
and because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmosp@@ her@@ ic system .
but we also spent many hours in the bas@@ ements of the united nations , trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imag@@ ined that these creatures exi@@ sted .
in 197@@ 9 , i wi@@ tn@@ essed my first military cou@@ p .
cluster bom@@ bs left behind .
if the offi@@ cer is hon@@ est , you get a huge pen@@ al@@ ty of being ar@@ rested for bri@@ ber@@ y .
all of us here have great minds .
hu@@ h@@ h ! they &apos;ve been discovered by the sul@@ tan .
now i told you -- i love the internet . i do .
i currently lead , in ethi@@ opia , an exciting new initiative to establi@@ sh the first ethi@@ opia com@@ modi@@ ty exchange , or ec@@ x .
now it &apos;s not a l@@ one nu@@ t , it &apos;s not two nu@@ ts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
then we were victims of don por@@ fi@@ rio .
6@@ 4@@ -@@ year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19 .
we probably went through it yesterday , or the day before , or the day before that .
it &apos;s actually e@@ mi@@ tting ultras@@ ound -- low-@@ level ultras@@ ound -- that &apos;s about 100,000 vibra@@ tions per second .
and i wanted , through color and large form@@ at cameras and very large prin@@ ts , to make a body of work that somehow became symb@@ ols of our use of the landscape , how we use the land .
&quot; i love how they were able to pres@@ er@@ ve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- bu@@ tter@@ flies , man@@ -@@ made forests , li@@ me@@ stone ca@@ ves and hey , even a huge py@@ th@@ on . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource sett@@ ings .
for hundreds of dollars , i &apos;ve developed a system that ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the sensi@@ tivity of dete@@ ctors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars .
new thinking on the climate crisis
so here &apos;s what i want you to do .
and i was writing terrible poe@@ try and kni@@ tting swe@@ at@@ ers for him .
sometimes they h@@ unt -- not that often , but when they h@@ unt , they show sophi@@ sti@@ cated co@@ operation , and they share the pre@@ y .
i &apos;m going to have a pretty simple idea that i &apos;m just going to tell you over and over until i get you to believe it , and that is all of us are makers .
this is a cre@@ ation story , i think , equ@@ ally as wonderful .
let me show you the living mobile phone .
she , better than most , knew the power of an image .
and so my journey now in the face of this defe@@ at .
now what is the accu@@ ra@@ cy of those dr@@ ones ?
now of course , there &apos;s a bunch of effects that this culture of cop@@ ying has on the creative process .
didn &apos;t notice any dra@@ gon@@ flies ; maybe they were there , maybe they weren &apos;t .
here , you can see in 2006 , they rais@@ ed almost three quar@@ ters of a chi@@ ck per nest , and you can see that they &apos;re clo@@ ser to pun@@ ta tom@@ bo ; they &apos;re not going as far away .
one illu@@ stration of the trans@@ forma@@ tional power of technology is in ki@@ ber@@ a .
then i just pick things up .
the only appropriate response would be a com@@ passionate sil@@ ence and some kind of practi@@ cal help .
how does that happen ? how do you make something flow through something ?
all scre@@ ens look into the one . no bi@@ ts will live outside the web .
they talk to international don@@ ors .
it &apos;s not consci@@ ously self-@@ ser@@ ving , but to a biolo@@ gist , that &apos;s the logi@@ c .
we need to act like the future depen@@ ds on it .
then he says to himself , very qui@@ et@@ ly , &quot; &#91; turbul@@ ent the sea , &#93; &#91; stre@@ t@@ ching across to sa@@ do &#93; &#91; the mi@@ lk@@ y way &#93; . &quot;
on the other hand , we have someone like ted bun@@ dy ; ted bun@@ dy was very f@@ ond of ab@@ du@@ cting and ra@@ ping and tor@@ turing and killing young women .
the rest of my family are bor@@ ing academi@@ cs , bu@@ sy colle@@ cting i@@ vy lea@@ gue dec@@ als for our classi@@ c am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or car .
and if you could see invi@@ sible matter , too .
i &apos;d like to end , before going back to the middle east , with a quote from one of the greatest sh@@ ei@@ k@@ h@@ s to put qu@@ ill to par@@ ch@@ ment .
and we went down , investi@@ g@@ ated .
i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
in a hear@@ t-@@ mel@@ ting moment , education ho@@ st john le@@ gend si@@ ts at the piano to sing &quot; true colors , &quot; giving the ly@@ ri@@ cs a special meaning for kids and teachers . &quot; so don &apos;t be afraid / to let them show / your true colors / are beautiful , like a rain@@ bo@@ w . &quot;
all across the globe , you have this ten@@ den@@ cy of men wanting a cer@@ tifi@@ cate .
the camera is always on .
and that &apos;s the great non-@@ arti@@ cul@@ ated ag@@ ony of subur@@ bia and one of the reasons that it l@@ ends itself to ridi@@ cule .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , you can think of physics as follo@@ ws .
they also totally get the idea that in some in@@ stances they can make more credi@@ ble promi@@ ses to long-@@ term inve@@ stors -- the kind of inve@@ stors who will come build the port , build the ro@@ ads , in a new city -- they can make more credi@@ ble promi@@ ses if they do it along with a partner nation .
and he said , &quot; when you go out on the river , do not under any cir@@ cum@@ stances eat the fish .
internet search eng@@ ines work by dra@@ wing reven@@ u@@ es from spon@@ sor@@ ed links that appe@@ ar when you do a search .
that &apos;s another artist book project .
imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this pro@@ posal .
these are leaders who , in addition to being highly capable , pos@@ s@@ ess two important quali@@ ties , and they are hu@@ mi@@ lity and ambi@@ tion .
we need to wait until 18@@ 80 , when this big man , charles darwin , publi@@ shes a wonderful , ast@@ oni@@ shing book that starts a revolution .
now the pen@@ is isn &apos;t actually requi@@ red for intern@@ al fertili@@ z@@ tion , but when intern@@ al fertili@@ zation evol@@ ves , pen@@ is@@ es often follow .
but it made people feel better .
my ini@@ tial work focused on uganda , where i focused on ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating re@@ forms with the fin@@ ance mini@@ stry of uganda so they could access our lo@@ ans .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 17@@ 3@@ 8 by a du@@ tch pol@@ y@@ math named daniel ber@@ n@@ ou@@ ll@@ i .
and he said , &quot; if you don &apos;t believe me , just take me with you . &quot;
here i was trying to help , and i had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing i had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box .
can you play &quot; flight of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ bee &quot; on that note ?
they &apos;re all different .
the actual paradig@@ m-@@ shift rate , the rate of adop@@ ting new ideas , is dou@@ bling every decade , according to our models .
the w was clearly a w , the n was clearly an n , even though they were very fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ary and there wasn &apos;t a lot of information in it .
all the students s@@ at around and they went ...
so , you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family . one , two , three , four , five children per woman on this axis .
and here &apos;s the thing .
no@@ vel@@ ty is a concept of commer@@ ce , not an a@@ esthe@@ tic concept .
or budd@@ ha -- if he saw the same cow , he would say , &quot; asking this question den@@ ies your own nature &#91; as a &#93; cow . &quot;
here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
it was in her brain , in her lungs , in her li@@ ver .
that , it seems to me , is a way to begin to re@@ store the art of democra@@ tic argument .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
where i come from , if you weren &apos;t a dra@@ g queen or a radical thin@@ ker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the wei@@ r@@ do .
audience : 195@@ 3 .
that &apos;s why being the grand prize w@@ inner of the google global science fair -- c@@ ute picture , right -- it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor .
that all of you seem to remember iran after the isla@@ mic revolution .
it might surprise some of you here , as it did me , when i discovered that su@@ i@@ cide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world , including the po@@ or@@ est countries of the world .
and they fly into the er@@ up@@ ting vol@@ can@@ o .
this pro@@ position will be found on care@@ ful exam@@ ination to ex@@ press , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the essential pur@@ port of the theory , and to ex@@ press in a few words all mr. darwin &apos;s meaning ; who , by a strange in@@ version of reas@@ oning , seems to think absolute ignor@@ ance fully quali@@ fied to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achi@@ ev@@ ements of creative sk@@ ill . &quot;
so , we all think we know what glamour is . here it is .
one woman never did .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully suppor@@ ted by the people , meaning that you also have to ad@@ just it to the local , cultural values .
clay shir@@ ky looks at &quot; cognitive sur@@ plus &quot; -- the shared , online work we do with our sp@@ are brain cycles . while we &apos;re bu@@ sy edi@@ ting wikipedia , po@@ sting to us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di , we &apos;re building a better , more co@@ oper@@ ative world .
then there was aron ka@@ der , who was the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an-@@ american .
and this is my sc@@ ari@@ est .
but the problem with rel@@ ying on rules and in@@ centi@@ ves is that they de@@ morali@@ ze professional activity , and they de@@ morali@@ ze professional activity in two senses .
i like doing more than just explor@@ ing these spaces .
after she got it , &quot; she was happy to report that she has discovered that he pos@@ sessed a double who was rich , vi@@ ri@@ le , hand@@ some and ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ tic . &quot;
what we need to build is a force for the everything else .
anyway , while we &apos;re here , again , if you want to visit anything , all you need to do is dou@@ ble@@ -@@ cli@@ ck .
so i was ad@@ mitted , in 197@@ 3 , in the spring of 197@@ 3 , to the institute of living , which used to be called the har@@ t@@ ford re@@ treat .
i think this is a very old human desire . it &apos;s nothing new .
so we want things that nest , we want things that st@@ ack , and we want it digi@@ ti@@ zed .
but of course , lincoln was as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ated by a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy .
now , some of these same social inve@@ stors are really interested in africa and understand the importance of agriculture , and they even helped the farmers .
juli@@ an tre@@ asure : why archite@@ cts need to use their e@@ ars
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a spac@@ e-@@ far@@ ing civilization .
with my dad , that turned out to be le@@ tting him fill out forms .
we like to build things .
all the peop@@ les that the bab@@ yl@@ oni@@ ans had repres@@ sed and re@@ moved will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their go@@ ds .
here &apos;s some more data from our te@@ sting .
and that this would oper@@ ate as a kind of citi@@ zen obser@@ vation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual vot@@ es , but also to help en@@ sure the san@@ cti@@ ty of the vote overall .
and this is what we turn them into .
what the hell difference should it make ?
it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally satur@@ ated with hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de -- enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
this shift is the most stri@@ king in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
but here &apos;s the thing . there are pl@@ enty of people in science education who would look at this and say there &apos;s no way that we could ever give that to students , because it con@@ tains some language that isn &apos;t completely accu@@ rate .
i want to end with a po@@ em by an american poet called luc@@ ille cli@@ ft@@ on .
she didn &apos;t inv@@ ent the idea of car@@ ing about this issue .
my journali@@ sm is hin@@ ged on three basic principles : nam@@ ing , sha@@ ming and ja@@ iling .
those people who buy them on the website have the ot@@ ak@@ u , and then they tell their friends , and it spre@@ ads and it spre@@ ads .
we &apos;ve lost that cap@@ ability . we ab@@ and@@ oned it in &apos; 7@@ 2 .
in taiwan , at an art museum , this 12-@@ year-old girl made a mush@@ room organ out of some mush@@ rooms that were from taiwan and some electri@@ cal ta@@ pe and hot gl@@ ue .
al@@ var@@ o si@@ z@@ a grew up and lived in por@@ tu@@ g@@ al and is probably considered the por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese main guy in architecture .
and i couldn &apos;t help notice that the people who were per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ating the app@@ all@@ ing at@@ ro@@ cities , the para@@ military organizations , were actually the same people running the organized cri@@ minal syn@@ di@@ c@@ ates .
and this is where it becomes true tri@@ ple bottom line .
you heard about ri@@ ots all across the land .
these are ti@@ les . the word , &quot; pla@@ yful &quot; is a necessary aspe@@ ct of our work because , actually , one of our problems is that we have to make , produce , lo@@ vely things throughout all of life , and this for me is now 75 years .
i was fascin@@ ated with the ab@@ sen@@ ce of light , and i wanted to find a way that i could give it materi@@ ality and p@@ in it down before it changed .
here is a plant called kevin , or maybe it &apos;s a plant belon@@ ging to a kid called kevin . i don &apos;t know .
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
the answer is , students in korea learn in large classes .
boy : this one ligh@@ ted up , and this one nothing .
and an image which may be clo@@ sest talks about the use of light as a medi@@ um , that light becomes literally a building material .
and with the material that &apos;s left -- because they wanted to destroy it , to burn it , they didn &apos;t understand it , they didn &apos;t go to school -- i pac@@ ked it .
all we have to do is go around and sample , dig into the ground , find those bu@@ gs , sequ@@ ence them , cor@@ rel@@ ate them to the kinds of charac@@ teri@@ stics we like and don &apos;t like -- that &apos;s just a big dat@@ ab@@ ase -- and then fertili@@ ze .
you will have come in cont@@ act with some of them .
and then my other second set of rules -- i hate to say &quot; rules &quot; because it &apos;s art -- my cri@@ teria would be the three h &apos;s , which is head , heart and hands .
so that this is possible to do this is not deni@@ able .
it mostly projects tra@@ ge@@ dy and fear and mis@@ fortun@@ e , and it projects that message , that story , so stron@@ gly that it almost bl@@ ots out anything else .
the bon@@ ob@@ o , although shor@@ ter than us and their arms still longer , is more up@@ right , just as we are .
we have the ability now , and maybe the moral ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , to re@@ pair some of the damage .
my own journey to work with these children started as a teenager .
the green represents the per@@ cent@@ age .
i don &apos;t play golf , so i couldn &apos;t actually road test these , but i did inter@@ view a guy who ow@@ ns them .
there &apos;s no real , true bal@@ an@@ cing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hi@@ de that actually ob@@ sc@@ ure the topic so much that people don &apos;t see things that are actually pretty strai@@ ght-@@ forward challenges .
for 18 days , our cameras were broad@@ casting , live , the voices of the people in ta@@ hri@@ r square .
so today , you can down@@ load products from the web -- anything you would have on your des@@ k@@ top , like p@@ ens , whi@@ st@@ les , le@@ mon squee@@ z@@ ers .
one way to get more women into leadership is to have other women ment@@ or them .
these sc@@ ans , the clini@@ cs say , can help prevent alzheimer &apos;s disease , solve weight and addi@@ ction issues , over@@ come mar@@ it@@ al confli@@ cts , and treat , of course , a variety of mental ill@@ n@@ esses ran@@ ging from depression to anxi@@ ety to ad@@ h@@ d .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speak@@ ers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dres@@ se@@ d-@@ up than the average ted speaker .
but , &quot; as mel@@ ville put it , &quot; they dre@@ aded can@@ ni@@ b@@ als . &quot;
so for some people we gave the same task .
and the result is that we are edu@@ cating people out of their creative cap@@ aci@@ ties . pi@@ cas@@ so once said this -- he said that all children are born artists .
he built the capital over there .
you &apos;ve got it in your brain ; you &apos;ve got it in your lungs .
if i pus@@ h him from a different angle , he &apos;ll re@@ act to it differently , and that &apos;s because he has a physical body , and because he has the motor skills to control that body .
don &apos;t worry , i do this all the time in the lab .
but , for me , i asked the question , &quot; well , where are these leaders coming from ?
or an expensive watch , so you can im@@ press people -- &quot; oh ge@@ e , i didn &apos;t know you had that watch . &quot;
the range of digital rela@@ tions is extraordinary .
so these are words like &quot; te@@ am@@ work &quot; or &quot; en@@ dur@@ ance &quot; or even complicated concepts like &quot; resource allo@@ cation &quot; or &quot; perspective , &quot; a word that they don &apos;t understand .
so we got this incredible video system . it &apos;s very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high spee@@ ds in low light .
so , for example , there are doctors in china who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
because we &apos;re putting a big fat ner@@ ve onto a little piece of mu@@ sc@@ le .
&quot; you &apos;ve had a terrible accident , young man . you &apos;ve broken your back .
and i would sub@@ mit that it &apos;s time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innova@@ tions , not only for their country , but ones that we can use in the developed world as well .
&quot; ten milli@@ gram , 20 milli@@ gram . &quot;
but it &apos;s really re@@ stor@@ ation of the ability to per@@ cei@@ ve beauty where we can get inspi@@ ring .
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
biolo@@ gist robert full studies the amazing ge@@ ck@@ o , with its super@@ sti@@ cky feet and ten@@ aci@@ ous clim@@ bing sk@@ ill . but high-@@ speed foot@@ age reve@@ als that the ge@@ ck@@ o &apos;s tail har@@ b@@ ors perhaps the most surprising tal@@ ents of all .
but i mean , i grew up with this incredible pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , and not just me -- millions of nigeri@@ ans grew up with books and libr@@ ari@@ es .
but more interest@@ ingly , the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nami@@ cs of this say , you &apos;re never going to get more than 20 percent effici@@ ency .
it is time that students of design in africa read the works of ti@@ t@@ ans like ch@@ ei@@ k@@ h anta di@@ op , senegal &apos;s ch@@ ei@@ k@@ h anta di@@ op , whose se@@ minal work on eg@@ y@@ pt is v@@ indi@@ cated by this discovery .
and so what you can do with that is to p@@ lot the distribu@@ tion of species and where they occur in the oceans .
first , i want to explain how and why cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine had such a profound influ@@ ence on inner@@ -@@ city gan@@ gs .
and we &apos;ve got to say , what good is all of our intellectu@@ al and political and economic power -- and i &apos;m really thinking intellectu@@ al power in this room -- if we can &apos;t use it to bring sla@@ very to an end ?
so parti@@ cle masses , the str@@ eng@@ ths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimen@@ sions .
except this isn &apos;t the cause , is it ?
it does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
we have seen that here today with the sense , with the sensi@@ tivity -- and in the last three days , and with the power of the in@@ d@@ omi@@ table human spirit .

every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy , from tiny , little animals like a nu@@ di@@ br@@ ank cra@@ w@@ ling over en@@ cru@@ sting spon@@ ge or a lea@@ ther@@ jack@@ et that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it gra@@ zes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .
and this is an analo@@ gy for today &apos;s construction and manufac@@ turing world with bru@@ te-@@ force as@@ sem@@ bly techniques .

according to non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations that keep such statistics , since 194@@ 5 , in europe and the ameri@@ c@@ as , there has been a ste@@ ep decline in inter@@ state wars , in dead@@ ly ethni@@ c ri@@ ots or po@@ gro@@ ms , and in military cou@@ ps , even in south america . worl@@ d@@ wide , there &apos;s been a ste@@ ep decline in dea@@ ths in inter@@ state wars . the yellow b@@ ars here show the number of dea@@ ths per war per year from 1950 to the present .
thank you so much .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lan@@ e , ran over the top of my car and his a@@ x@@ le t@@ ore my arm off .
it &apos;s going to be available in all the book@@ stores in the bay area and throughout the world , on amaz@@ on and you name it . &quot;
enough of a clu@@ e ? so , you get the pattern , right ? ok .
or if we look in other parts of the electro@@ magne@@ tic spec@@ trum , we see that there &apos;s a lot of gas in this cluster , as well .
he was in the na@@ tivity play .
so the pu@@ p you see on the bottom is affe@@ cted by atraz@@ ine that its grand@@ mother was ex@@ posed to .
this is from est@@ elle will@@ ough@@ s@@ by .
so , there we were .
we so often don &apos;t realize what our action and our in@@ action does to people we think we will never see and never know .
that &apos;s larger than the entire population of russia .
so it &apos;s about 6 : 30 now , suggests that most of us should have lied .
so he &apos;s actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face .
music tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ esthe@@ tic beauty alone .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who suff@@ ered in a pre-@@ civil rights america , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ ator of the day .
so we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session , and from all the different present@@ ers .
here is just a little bit of data .
eventually , i re@@ signed as princi@@ p@@ al investi@@ g@@ ator on our ven@@ us experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important .
and the answer is : all of them .
these two new air@@ plan@@ es are the same speed as the d@@ c@@ 8 that was done in 195@@ 8 .
we hold ourselves back .
somebody was talking yesterday about mas@@ lo@@ wi@@ an hier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
and we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
to go back to that toilet , it wasn &apos;t a particularly fan@@ cy toilet , it wasn &apos;t as nice as this one from the world toilet organization .
the job of un@@ cover@@ ing the global food waste sc@@ and@@ al started for me when i was 15 years old .
and then they stopp@@ ed , and the man turned to me and said , &quot; what are you looking for , flying sau@@ cers ? &quot;
and suddenly i was on the phone to my stock@@ bro@@ ker and my real e@@ state agen@@ t , when i should have been talking to my clients .
you can get it out .
because someone at the milk board , right -- and don &apos;t get me wrong , i support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some ge@@ e@@ zer to work out that if you put loads of fla@@ vor@@ ings and col@@ or@@ ings and sugar in milk , right , more kids will drin@@ k it . yeah .
so i thought , why don &apos;t we get into that business ?
i got to see the last case of kil@@ ler small@@ po@@ x in the world .
i don &apos;t think so .
swa@@ hil@@ i is spo@@ ken by about 50 million people in east africa .
so you might want to have multiple robots carry pa@@ y@@ loads .
j@@ ac@@ ek ut@@ ko is an extraordinary poli@@ sh new@@ spa@@ per designer whose re@@ designs for pa@@ pers in eastern europe not only win a@@ wards , but increase circu@@ lation by up to 100 % . can good design save the new@@ spa@@ per ? it just might .
in the 200@@ 6@@ -@@ 2007 budget , expected revenue : 2.@@ 5 trilli@@ on shi@@ ll@@ ings .
ro@@ l@@ f bo@@ lin , who was a professor at the hop@@ kin &apos;s mar@@ ine station where i work , wrote in the 194@@ 0s that &quot; the fu@@ mes from the sc@@ um flo@@ ating on the in@@ lets of the bay were so bad they turned le@@ ad@@ -@@ based pain@@ ts black . &quot;
truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant , because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time .
how about that ? do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
mean@@ while , food production had become industrial . industrial .
they said we couldn &apos;t do iraq .
a group of di@@ v@@ ini@@ ty students at the prin@@ c@@ eton the@@ ological se@@ min@@ ary were told that they were going to give a practice ser@@ mon and they were each given a ser@@ mon topic .
what we believe , obviously -- and you know this -- determin@@ es our behavior , and our behavior determin@@ es what we become in life .
would they ye@@ ar@@ n for my appro@@ val , my love , my voice ?
the bron@@ chi bran@@ ch , bran@@ ch , bran@@ ch and they stop bran@@ ching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical consider@@ ations : the mu@@ c@@ us , which is in the lung .
that education will work better if we &apos;ve got electricity and ra@@ il@@ ro@@ ads , and so on .
perhaps the addition of m@@ s. goo@@ de is what made this story more complete .
my mother sent y@@ ams and ri@@ ce , and our old clo@@ th@@ es , to his family .
they have something i call &quot; ot@@ ak@@ u &quot; -- it &apos;s a great japanese word .
it &apos;s not op@@ tional . it &apos;s not a lu@@ x@@ ury . it &apos;s an absolute ne@@ c@@ es@@ sity .
today we know the molecular cause of 4,000 diseases , but treat@@ ments are available for only 250 of them . so what &apos;s taking so long ? gene@@ ti@@ cist and physician francis c@@ oll@@ ins explains why syste@@ matic drug discovery is im@@ per@@ ative , even for r@@ are and complex diseases , and off@@ ers a few solutions -- like teaching old drugs new tricks .
it &apos;s a molecular computer building an electronic computer .
so the cell acts like an em@@ br@@ yo . what an exciting thing .
the problem with today &apos;s cultural g@@ he@@ t@@ tos is not lack of knowledge -- we know a lot about each other , or so we think -- but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , distant and dis@@ connected .
the cyber@@ t@@ opi@@ ans say , much like fa@@ x machines and x@@ ero@@ x machines did in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , blogs and social networks have radi@@ cally transformed the economi@@ cs of pro@@ test , so people would ine@@ vit@@ ably re@@ bel .
right ? so , when institutions are told they are ob@@ stac@@ les , and that there are other ways of coordin@@ ating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ bl@@ er-@@ ross sta@@ ges -- -- of reaction , being told you have a f@@ at@@ al ill@@ ness : deni@@ al , an@@ ger , bar@@ ga@@ ining , ac@@ cept@@ ance .
bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
it &apos;s about perfe@@ cting something old , and bringing something old into the 21@@ st century .
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas , because you have pl@@ enty of natural gas .
but at the time we had to throw in the to@@ we@@ l .
it &apos;s much more organic . it &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
here in biosphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because i pick up the phone and i call and say , &quot; hey , can you deli@@ ver the pi@@ zza ? &quot;
i thought i would read po@@ em@@ s i have that rel@@ ate to the subject of you@@ th and age .
some of you have felt it in laborat@@ ories ; some of you have felt it at the work@@ ben@@ ch .
but first , i need to talk to you about a story , which is my story , about the story of this country that you &apos;re all here in today .
well , you &apos;re right to be a bit sk@@ ep@@ tical , because that &apos;s not the answer .
so he and mom went to dinner , and i s@@ nu@@ ck out and thought it &apos;d be really cool to do don@@ u@@ ts or even some figu@@ re-@@ ei@@ ghts in the s@@ now .
we can understand func@@ tion@@ ality . this is really important .
adam b@@ ou@@ langer : yes . so , tod and i ent@@ ered into a discussion following the te@@ w@@ k@@ sbur@@ y work and it was really about how dan is an expres@@ sive person , and he &apos;s an intelligent and creative person . and it &apos;s in his face , it &apos;s in his breathing , it &apos;s in his eyes . how come he can &apos;t perform one of his pieces of music ? that &apos;s our responsibility , and it doesn &apos;t make sense .
what do you think kar@@ a@@ j@@ an &apos;s re@@ p@@ ly was ? when should i start ?
immediately after the ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment with ka@@ plan , i went to see dr. mar@@ der , a schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia exper@@ t who was following me for medi@@ cation side effects .
and this still goes on as i think i told you last year .
whose clever move was it ?
if you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
why ?
and it would be self-@@ illu@@ min@@ ated , because now the sun &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light -- so let &apos;s make our little earth self-@@ illu@@ min@@ ated .
so what would be better &#91; than &#93; to use the her@@ ring g@@ ul@@ l , in its freedom , cir@@ cl@@ ing and s@@ wo@@ oping over the sea , and &#91; to &#93; use this as a role model ?
the first thing they do is they de@@ cor@@ ated the cei@@ ling .
it &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
then they take us to a ma@@ dr@@ as@@ sa and teach us things from the koran .
and that actually isn &apos;t necessarily really pla@@ yful .
everything is hop@@ eless -- we &apos;re always being told so by the media . &quot;
for example , anything you want to post , like &quot; get together &quot; or &quot; meet up &quot; or &quot; walk , &quot; it is automatically recorded and data min@@ ed and reported to a po@@ ll for further political analy@@ zing .
ju@@ dge for@@ er did what she was requi@@ red to do , and then she qu@@ it the ben@@ ch .
okay , not very many people know about it .
see this line , this is a landscape for violent video games .
one good thing did come out of it .
let &apos;s not forget that some of the worst diseases of human@@ kind are diseases such as depression , alzheimer &apos;s disease , drug addi@@ ction .
now , sud@@ hi@@ r got to know very well the guy who had the un@@ fortun@@ ate as@@ sign@@ ment of trying to take the i@@ o@@ wa fran@@ chi@@ se .
and all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chi@@ ck fli@@ cks .
we always had hope .
it vari@@ es a bit pro@@ vin@@ ce to pro@@ vin@@ ce .
it li@@ sts every known mental disorder .
what is it about you ?
at the time , this was thought to be a one-@@ off .
it basically organi@@ zes itself . &quot;
i don &apos;t believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopp@@ ed .
the v@@ et diagno@@ sed this as trans@@ mis@@ sible v@@ ener@@ e@@ al tumor , a sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted cancer that affe@@ cts do@@ gs .
in east asia , we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea , taiwan , h@@ ong kon@@ g and sing@@ apo@@ re .
and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team eff@@ ort , and with wonderful results like that flight .
you know , he wrote in one of his books : &quot; a yale student once said , &apos; i came here to learn how to design , not how to use a computer . &apos; design schools take he@@ ed . &quot;
i &apos;m showing you two works , one on the right by le@@ on gol@@ u@@ b , one on the left by robert col@@ esc@@ ot@@ t .
because human beings are , to some ex@@ tent , hi@@ vi@@ sh creatures like bees .
thank you very much .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really intri@@ cate projects like lea@@ ves sor@@ ted by hu@@ e , so you get a color fa@@ de and put in a circle like a w@@ re@@ ath .
that is safe , steri@@ le drin@@ king water .
i got to do what many women have -- the j@@ el@@ ly on the bel@@ ly and b@@ zz@@ zz .
ev@@ a ver@@ tes -- only 19 when she gave this talk -- disc@@ us@@ ses her journey toward studying medicine and her drive to understand the roots of cancer and alzheimer &apos;s .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miser@@ able because , you know , we &apos;re from russia .
and we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the s@@ hr@@ ine , which has not changed since 194@@ 9 , still seats 6@@ ,000 people .
other hom@@ eless people didn &apos;t see me as hom@@ eless , but i did .
so we put in do@@ gs mat@@ ing , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally ab@@ sor@@ bed .
so what can we do ?
it did mine .
and to point out the power of this : these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives .
this is for real . and what they do is , up until that time period when they can &apos;t strike , they become really ob@@ no@@ xi@@ ous and awful , and they strike everything in sight ; it doesn &apos;t matter who or what .
and it can be sort of cra@@ z@@ y-@@ making , h@@ ous@@ ing both the my@@ stic and the war@@ ri@@ or in one body .
since birth , we have both suff@@ ered from the in@@ ability to fly on our own .
it was the future i couldn &apos;t accept .
can everybody see ? all right .
we had -- we were being attac@@ ked by british air@@ ways .
and this study has been published on september 8 , 2008 , and it &apos;s available on the government of india website .
and it is through communi@@ cations today that i believe that that is not an un@@ real idea .
every fish that gets away gro@@ ws with every telling of the tale .
200 billion .
we &apos;re in the process of trans@@ forming from this , to what i would call a bi@@ ophi@@ lic society , one where we learn to nur@@ ture society .
we had a sa@@ van@@ na , a mar@@ sh , a desert .
you also may be taking into accoun@@ t the fact that it &apos;s incredibly pain@@ ful .
and they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
but sometimes , that &apos;s not the case .
and then an enzy@@ me in its di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve tra@@ ct le@@ e@@ ches into the be@@ ans , and people with the un@@ en@@ vi@@ able job of colle@@ cting these cat@@ s &apos; lea@@ vings then go through the forest colle@@ cting the , you know , results and process@@ ing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the un@@ process@@ ed form .
i think even nasa can do that , and they pro@@ ved that they can .
and that really reson@@ ated with me , because i want to tell you a little story about being an im@@ post@@ or and feeling like i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
what happens when that ar@@ row goes aw@@ ry ?
it &apos;s ine@@ vi@@ table , terrible , but really what i want to talk about is , i &apos;m just fascin@@ ated by the leg@@ acy people leave when they die .
members were encoura@@ ged to bring their wi@@ ves , daugh@@ ters and si@@ sters to the me@@ et@@ ings of the british associ@@ ation , and while the women were expected to at@@ tend only the public le@@ ctures and the social events like this one , they began to in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the scientific ses@@ sions as well .
for wind , there &apos;s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
ali@@ son g@@ op@@ ni@@ k : okay , so his first hypothe@@ sis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied .
could i go and speak to older and wis@@ er people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
but they &apos;re also trying to under@@ mine everything in the game .
you &apos;ll change your car , if you have one , three or four times .
almost anybody who &apos;s looked at well-@@ run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion .
it is christmas day , 4 a@@ .@@ m .
we need to help to li@@ ft them out of poverty .
it is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
and so this book is called &quot; prob@@ es . &quot; it &apos;s another word for quot@@ es .
and i kind of ru@@ min@@ ated on that for a couple of days .
so what can we learn about this ? how can we apply this insight ?
each one is formed by one fair@@ ly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stam@@ ping steel .
so while eg@@ ypti@@ ans were known for their sing@@ le-@@ di@@ g@@ it tur@@ n@@ out in elections before the revolution , the last ele@@ ction had around 70 percent vot@@ er tur@@ n@@ out -- men and women .
and they got involved in it , and the scientific and industrial establi@@ sh@@ ment was born , and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money , you know , because it was suddenly available .
so he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . and he would gra@@ b my pin@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
and as i looked at it , to me it didn &apos;t make sense how we were appro@@ aching cancer , and in order to make sense of it , i had to learn where did this come from .
and there &apos;s leadership , but there &apos;s no one leader .
re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp in dar@@ fu@@ r .
think about it . whether that &apos;s you in that picture or something under your des@@ k .
so what &apos;s a technology that will allow us to make gin@@ or@@ mous hou@@ ses ?
even though at least a third of them , deep in their hearts , actually did .
we stand in elections ; we vote in elections ; we obser@@ ve elections .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ators from titan corpo@@ ration , all there , and they &apos;re getting no information about the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy .
in this very short period of time , you know , whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online , or the last , you know , four or five years of being online all the time , our relationship to our surro@@ und@@ ings had changed in that our attention is constantly divi@@ ded . you know , we &apos;re both looking inside the scre@@ ens and we &apos;re looking out in the world around us .
it &apos;s trying to re@@ cover .
less than three-@@ ten@@ ths of one percent had to trans@@ fer to the more expensive secon@@ d-@@ line drugs .
astro@@ lab@@ es , like every technology , do evolve over time .
cities were totally wi@@ ped out because of the lack of water .
so , he has four kids , right ?
two hours ? one , maybe ?
and with that ex@@ hi@@ lar@@ ation , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
the students run the game .
now , hundreds of homes were destro@@ yed .
jon@@ a@@ than har@@ r@@ is : the web as art
so i said yes to this pro@@ position .
there are many , many ways of im@@ prin@@ ting c@@ ds or d@@ v@@ ds , but those are all being standar@@ di@@ zed as well .
and by the time i was an inter@@ n house offi@@ cer , i could bar@@ ely afford to main@@ tain my mother &apos;s 13@@ -@@ year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor .
so what happens when a person gets a re@@ tin@@ al de@@ gener@@ ative disease like ma@@ cular de@@ generation ? what happens is is that , the fron@@ t-@@ end cells die , the ph@@ ot@@ ore@@ cept@@ ors die , and over time , all the cells and the circu@@ its that are connected to them , they die too .
by pie@@ cing together a complex ecolo@@ gi@@ cal puzzle , biolo@@ gist willi@@ e smi@@ ts belie@@ ves he has found a way to re-@@ grow clear@@ cut rain@@ forest in bor@@ ne@@ o , saving local or@@ an@@ gu@@ t@@ ans -- and creating a thri@@ ll@@ ing blu@@ e@@ print for re@@ stor@@ ing fragi@@ le ecosystems . &amp; lt ; b &amp; gt ; up@@ date : dec@@ ember 20@@ 12 : the core content of this talk has been challen@@ ged on a number of gro@@ unds . for details , and for willi@@ e smi@@ ts &apos; response to these cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sms , please see &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; h@@ tt@@ ps : / / ww@@ w@@ .@@ ted@@ .com / pages / 7@@ 9@@ 1 &quot; &amp; gt ; this page &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; . &amp; lt ; / b &amp; gt ;
now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a hor@@ ror story .
and here we have high-@@ income countries in the o@@ ec@@ d .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
now there was a very interesting article by clay shir@@ ky that got a lot of attention about a month ago , and this is basically the distribu@@ tion of links on the web to all these various different blogs .
shall i ever so slightly shift my weight to the left ?
he &apos;s got the over@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed lea@@ ther sat@@ ch@@ el and the re@@ ct@@ an@@ gu@@ lar fi@@ le case and a laptop bag and the t@@ we@@ ed jack@@ et with the lea@@ ther pat@@ ches , and — — he looks at them , and then in a blin@@ k of an eye , he kne@@ els down in front of them , and he starts to say , &quot; you know , listen , here &apos;s how you can do it . look , if you do this -- &quot; and he takes the l@@ ac@@ es out of their hand , and inst@@ antly , he starts t@@ ying these kn@@ ots , and even better than they were doing it , remark@@ ably .
by leading a movement and making change .
this is what happens every spring . for six weeks , six to eight weeks , i have this flus@@ h of green o@@ a@@ sis .
organic chemi@@ sts make molecules , very complicated molecules , by ch@@ opp@@ ing up a big mole@@ cule into small molecules and rever@@ se engineering .
i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year .
well , some of that sp@@ ran@@ g from our work .
and so , here &apos;s what &apos;s happened in brazi@@ l .
so what happens with this is they &apos;re saying , &quot; right , you have a data das@@ h@@ board . we know how far you &apos;ve run , how far you &apos;ve moved , what your cal@@ ori@@ e in@@ take , all that sort of stuff .
and if you &apos;re wondering , no , there have been no known f@@ at@@ ali@@ ties associated with cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing .
this has never been seen before .
where i &apos;m losing so that i could win the bat@@ tle that i &apos;m fighting now .
i never har@@ med anyone . i never made any direct thre@@ ats .
and that wor@@ thy ambi@@ tion became his lo@@ de@@ star .
that &apos;s the economic invi@@ sibility of nature .
a few weeks later , my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her inf@@ ant son in her arms to give him to a stran@@ ger on a bus , which was one of the last bu@@ ses lea@@ ving sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo to take children out so they could be safe .
thank you .
all the religions in the world are fully capable to main@@ tain their values and ada@@ pt to this new world .
that &apos;s wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs .
i think it &apos;s interesting in that this faci@@ lity , i think , is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries , literally , every country in the world -- because we have see@@ ds from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that &apos;s both long term , sustainable and positive .
and for the first time , i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
now actually , this is quite cru@@ de in compar@@ is@@ on to our regular inner e@@ ar .
we have to re@@ mix it . he &apos;s got a great voice .
the top picture is a group of mo@@ oni@@ es that have been bl@@ essed by their mes@@ si@@ ah .
but i &apos;m really afraid we need much , much more .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know very much about org charts , but if you were to as@@ sign a stri@@ ppe@@ d-@@ down and simpli@@ fied mc@@ don@@ al@@ d &apos;s org chart , this is exactly what the org chart would look like .
and you can get an intui@@ tive appreci@@ ation for this if you imagine just the people at the peri@@ meter of the network .
and it would change as the colony gets larger .
hab@@ its , certain@@ ties , con@@ vi@@ ctions , ex@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion mar@@ ks , paradig@@ ms , do@@ g@@ mas .
and this is the work by eve mar@@ der and her many colleagues who &apos;ve been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many , many , many things because of neuro@@ mo@@ du@@ lation that can take place on a moment@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ moment basis .
it &apos;s been shown to pro@@ mote pre-@@ fron@@ tal cortex development where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
many of you , i think , have probably tre@@ k@@ ked here .
i promise you the hand of the dor@@ is du@@ ke chari@@ table foundation is stre@@ tched out in friend@@ ship for now and years to come .
how dis@@ gu@@ sting .
so , once a month for the last year , i &apos;ve been doing a colum@@ n called &quot; the principles of un@@ certain@@ ty , &quot; which , you know , i don &apos;t know who hei@@ sen@@ berg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it &apos;s the principles of un@@ certain@@ ty , so , you know .
the pieces appe@@ ar and disappear , but maybe more importantly -- this is just looking north from the center of the instal@@ lation -- they create a field , a field that invol@@ ves living and the surro@@ gate bodies in a kind of relation , a relation with each other and a relation with that li@@ mit , the edge , the horiz@@ on .
each ligh@@ t@@ ning b@@ ol@@ t he@@ ats the air to 4@@ 4,000 degrees fahr@@ enheit -- hot@@ ter than the surface of the sun .
our energy sources are not sustainable .
and they don &apos;t want to let me in .
by the way , all these weird names -- i didn &apos;t bo@@ ther you with the la@@ tin names of these creatures , okay , just the popular names .
chimpanze@@ es , kil@@ ler wh@@ ales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
in fact , the model was really , give everybody a car , build ro@@ ads to everything , and give people a place to park when they get there . it was not a very functional model .
and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called anthro@@ ph@@ ony .
the suffering of indi@@ gen@@ ous peop@@ les is not a simple issue to fix .
is then sustainable development ut@@ opia ?
and this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it shows two things : first of all , it &apos;s in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 196@@ 0s and early 7@@ 0s , you took pictures in black and white .
go underneath it . go above it . go around it .
we are living in an age of sur@@ ging income ine@@ quality , particularly between those at the very top and everyone else .
and so we &apos;ve done something here that is her@@ e@@ tical .
my father was a ba@@ pti@@ st minister , and he believed in mira@@ cles , and that god &apos;s will would take care of that .
i learned how to effectively communicate across bor@@ ders without being dete@@ cted .
so shor@@ tly after the war , this young man , y@@ u@@ ta@@ ka tani@@ y@@ ama , developed this amazing con@@ je@@ cture called the tani@@ y@@ ama@@ -@@ shi@@ mur@@ a con@@ je@@ cture .
these are one of the guys i work with . this is a brown ca@@ pu@@ ch@@ in mon@@ key .
the first one is happening right here in chi@@ ca@@ go .
in domestic birds , especially chi@@ ck@@ ens , it &apos;s 100 percent le@@ thal .
and while this machine in some sense is sil@@ ly , in retro@@ spe@@ ct , it actually served a very important purpose .
to the con@@ tr@@ ary , we knew that this project would destroy the environment : it would destroy ri@@ par@@ i@@ an forests , which were the basis for the survival of nom@@ adi@@ c groups , the sam@@ bur@@ u and the tur@@ kan@@ a in this area .
there &apos;s a medical revolution happening all around us , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to help us con@@ qu@@ er some of society &apos;s most dre@@ aded conditions , including cancer .
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prop@@ he@@ tic than dramatic .
when real ? when for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ?
it was u@@ sel@@ ess to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it .
but what did di@@ stur@@ b her was she got very persi@@ stent images or hallu@@ cin@@ ations of faces and as with ros@@ alie , the faces were often de@@ formed , with very large te@@ eth or very large eyes .
now , he gets to f-@@ sharp , and finally he goes down to e , but it &apos;s the wrong ch@@ ord -- because the ch@@ ord he &apos;s looking for is this one , and instead he does ...
nobody is controlling what you do .
weird p@@ hr@@ ases and words , even if you have a ph@@ d of chinese language , you can &apos;t understand them .
one question for you .
watch her hor@@ ses . .
when they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cop@@ e and to integra@@ te into society .
he sub@@ sequ@@ ently got married again at 10@@ 2 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
it was life itself . i realized that this wasn &apos;t just my pain .
i &apos;d love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace . &quot;
he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect , the way of life they needed to nur@@ ture .
because the small ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der once was the big thing .
and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tick@@ ling .
cre@@ ati@@ vely , we &apos;ve failed to communicate this success so far .
and this shows a recently virg@@ in queen . here &apos;s her w@@ ings .
or let &apos;s try asking about , i don &apos;t know , the international space station .
they have what i called &quot; lo@@ gor@@ r@@ he@@ a de@@ men@@ ti@@ a , &quot; which is they talk so much they drive themselves in@@ san@@ e .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
the first one was that when heli@@ um at@@ oms touch each other , they re@@ pel .
thank you .
and the mix@@ ture that the patient in@@ hal@@ es needs to be at least a certain per@@ cent@@ age oxygen or else it can become dangerous .
but what &apos;s interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much .
when the male brain works well , it works extremely well .
and congress did something .
so the g@@ ul@@ f is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean .
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
and o@@ dd@@ ly , the most not@@ able letter of re@@ je@@ ction i ever received came from wal@@ t disney world , a seem@@ ingly inno@@ cu@@ ous site .
over the last 30 years , in terms of the gd@@ p growth rates , china has gro@@ wn at twice the rate of india .
is beauty in the eye of the be@@ hol@@ der ?
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &apos;s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tra@@ cking device on someone else &apos;s car .
now -- -- one guy laugh@@ ed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
today , after 20 years of watching tv ge@@ ared to make me emotional , even a de@@ cent in@@ surance commercial can bring tears to my eyes .
and instead of app@@ lying fee@@ ble human minds to desig@@ ning these tools from sc@@ rat@@ ch , there were these read@@ y-@@ made solutions right out there in nature developed and re@@ fin@@ ed ste@@ adi@@ ly for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all .
so we are doing our job .
it &apos;s not even mining .
how could we survive that ?
and in the u.@@ n@@ . , you don &apos;t get that many people who actually man@@ age to mer@@ ge those quali@@ ties .
all of life is controlled by networks -- from the in@@ tra@@ cellu@@ lar through the multi@@ cellu@@ lar through the ecosystem level .
and we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
and if i ever get to hea@@ ven , it will be because i held my piece for 45 minutes and did not inter@@ ru@@ pt my patient .
so this kind of tra@@ cks me at any given moment .
she went to ju@@ are@@ z to take care of an a@@ iling a@@ unt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the mur@@ der@@ ed and disappe@@ ared women of ju@@ are@@ z .
we can predi@@ ct the accident and we can predi@@ ct who , which cars , are in the best position to move out of the way to calcu@@ late the sa@@ fest rou@@ te for everyone .
that did not make sense . they were not above a mag@@ ma cham@@ ber .

we &apos;re the sa@@ dd@@ est place on earth , relative to gd@@ p per capita -- the sa@@ dd@@ est place on earth .
you know , it &apos;s very old . this is a pla@@ te from 17@@ 9@@ 7 .
now , a kilo of l@@ enti@@ ls is tiny .
this is exactly what you want to do on the ste@@ ering whe@@ el to catch the car in this situation .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and so she said , &quot; so , if i came out of the woods &quot; — this is her bro@@ ther and sister — &quot; if i came out of the woods , a@@ val@@ on and don@@ o@@ van might be gone . &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
and finally , we need to understand that in bo@@ s@@ nia and kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our hu@@ mi@@ lity -- was the t@@ ent@@ ative nature of our engagement .
the capacity for girls to over@@ come situ@@ ations and to move on levels , to me , is min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing .

but there was no engineering software to model something por@@ ous and moving .
when i was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there &apos;s almost two billion .
and o@@ be@@ sity we already talked about , the ways to get to that .
as you all know , new@@ spr@@ int yel@@ lo@@ ws signific@@ antly in the sun .
it &apos;s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
and that saying is that gene@@ tics loads the gun , but the environment pul@@ ls the tri@@ gger .
r@@ b : nobody &apos;s ever called me sir richard .
it was con@@ sum@@ ing so much of our time after hours on wee@@ ken@@ ds that we thought , we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could qu@@ it my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level .
also coming up later for cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm are these massive lights .
of course , all the british press got really up@@ set .
we need a greater dem@@ and for ideas -- those larger markets i was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world .
and what &apos;s cir@@ cl@@ ed is the site that i &apos;m going to talk about , the go@@ wan@@ us can@@ al and gover@@ nor@@ s island .
to some , this has terri@@ fying priv@@ acy and civil liber@@ ties implications . to others it for@@ et@@ ells of an era of greater priv@@ acy and civil liber@@ ties prote@@ ctions , but priv@@ acy and civil liber@@ ties are of fundamental importance .
their heart is in the right place , like rat@@ an tat@@ a .
the pra@@ yer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark .
the ro@@ cket was huge .
on the one hand , we have an apoll@@ oni@@ an perspective , which is very cri@@ s@@ p and pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated and intellectu@@ alized and perfect .
and last is that we &apos;re more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you &apos;re sitting next to someone .
you can sort of see the funk@@ y new con@@ do buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street .
put that in there . there we go .
and we need a lot of sun@@ light in this trou@@ bled world .
in addition to being an ordinary nami@@ bi@@ an and in addition to being a him@@ ba i &apos;m also a trained conser@@ va@@ tion@@ ist .
in those dom@@ a@@ ins , bringing market mechan@@ isms and c@@ ash in@@ centi@@ ves may under@@ mine or crowd out non@@ market values and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des worth car@@ ing about .
100 years ago in most countries in europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
if you score us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average i@@ .@@ q@@ . of 1@@ 30 .
and i think the implications here are profound , whether it &apos;s for science , for commer@@ ce , for government , or perhaps most of all , for us as individuals .
but right now , most of the companies involved in these supply cha@@ ins don &apos;t have any way of as@@ sur@@ ing us that nobody had to mort@@ ga@@ ge their future , nobody had to sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product .
but now it &apos;s contribu@@ ting gas across the cas@@ pi@@ an sea to provide for europe , and even a poten@@ tially turk@@ men@@ - afgh@@ an-@@ paki@@ stan@@ -@@ india pipeline as well .
it &apos;s increased our depen@@ dence on foreign oil despite the ga@@ ins in fuel effici@@ ency .
the next thing that i &apos;d like to show you is something that dun@@ lo@@ p asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five &apos;s &quot; fi@@ f@@ th ge@@ ar show . &quot;
we know ch@@ im@@ ps are faster and stronger .
it was a d@@ ental com@@ po@@ und that we used to make these bo@@ ots .
you &apos;ve for@@ gotten all about the elephant haven &apos;t you ? &quot;
one is the understanding part of it . this is just a regular definition : the ability to understand and share the feelings of another .
it can improve health , and it can play a part in redu@@ cing , if not elimin@@ ating , poverty .
for@@ mer gu@@ ests from around the world had seen that the ri@@ ots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
there &apos;s no gap between rich and poor any longer . this is a my@@ th .
most of this is in developing countries , and the maj@@ ority is in africa .
the sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us doesn &apos;t men@@ tion even the fact that we &apos;re na@@ ked , let alone look for a reason to it .
and someone , at some point , came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn &apos;t make a difference in the world .
but in fact , that question &quot; is it still ethi@@ cal ? &quot;
so when people &apos;s symptoms go away , they tend to re@@ cu@@ r , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gra@@ titude , what are the positive emotions .
well , got that wrong , didn &apos;t we ?
i &apos;m more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer , i find that african wri@@ ters have always been the cur@@ ators of our humanity on this contin@@ ent .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
this symbo@@ l can in turn be follo@@ wed by these fi@@ sh@@ -like symb@@ ols and some other sig@@ ns , but never by these other sig@@ ns at the bottom .

it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
your father , is he alive ?
that &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
we &apos;re not asking for your money . we &apos;re asking for your voice .
now we &apos;re making scot@@ tish tar@@ t@@ ans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of scot@@ tish ancestors .
but we have no idea what we &apos;re going find when we go out there with our technology .
sol@@ ly grew up ten@@ ding to his father &apos;s cat@@ tle .
it &apos;s humanity &apos;s dna .
and then people started to feel that there &apos;s something new happening .
so : one , two , three , go .
at ted @ can@@ nes , g@@ ary wol@@ f gives a 5@@ -@@ m@@ in in@@ tr@@ o to an intri@@ gu@@ ing new pa@@ sti@@ me : using mobile apps and al@@ wa@@ y@@ s-@@ on g@@ ad@@ gets to track and analy@@ ze your body , mo@@ od , diet , spending -- just about everything in da@@ ily life you can measure -- in gl@@ ori@@ ously ge@@ ek@@ y detail .
so sa@@ fe@@ ty , with respect to the appli@@ cation , this is the number one answer that we get from gro@@ wers , why biological control .
sexu@@ ally un@@ attra@@ ctive people leave us cold .
and until 3@@ 0,000 years ago , at least three u@@ pri@@ ght-@@ walking apes shared the planet earth .
i &apos;m hiv positive . i &apos;ve de@@ alt with it all . &quot;
that &apos;s also clear , and that &apos;s where some of the limits of international compar@@ is@@ ons of pi@@ sa are .
sometimes i go to bill &apos;s farm and volun@@ te@@ er , so i can see up close and personal where the meat i eat comes from .
i feel that there are some things that are getting in the way .
in moti@@ har@@ i in cham@@ par@@ an , there are a lot of people who sell tea on the sha@@ ck and , obviously , there &apos;s a limited market for tea .
and not only did those su@@ i@@ cide bom@@ bers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hat@@ red , more ra@@ ge , more fear and certainly des@@ pair .
am@@ ne@@ si@@ ac@@ s do exactly the same thing . think about this result .
you put the elements into a su@@ it@@ case .
and i s@@ at like you guys there in the audience .
don &apos;t read them bed@@ time stories every night .
you kept moving ahead in a life where you &apos;re depen@@ dent on working for somebody .
let me give you the example .
and what was so gor@@ geous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter hi@@ g@@ gs and his team considered one of the deep@@ est of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
film@@ ma@@ ker pen@@ el@@ op@@ e ja@@ ges@@ sa@@ r ch@@ aff@@ er was curi@@ ous about the chemi@@ c@@ als she was ex@@ posed to while pre@@ gn@@ ant : could they affect her un@@ born child ? so she asked scientist ty@@ r@@ one ha@@ yes to brief her on one he studied closely : atraz@@ ine , a her@@ bi@@ cide used on corn . on@@ stage together at ted@@ women , ha@@ yes and ch@@ aff@@ er tell their story .
if so , that &apos;s a real step forward .
you &apos;re just sm@@ elling for smo@@ ke so you can follow the tra@@ il back to a burning house , so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him .
a belo@@ ved grand@@ mother , a lo@@ ver -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
so in my village now , kids there , they normally listen to bbc , or any radio , and they are waiting to know , the day em@@ manu@@ el will eat his break@@ fast it means he got the money to build our school .
what do we know about the country and the people that we pret@@ end to protect , about the villa@@ ges where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opi@@ um ?
many countries have not developed inclu@@ sive schools , and so even children with a very mi@@ ld dis@@ ability are sent away to a resi@@ denti@@ al special school , at age six or seven .
they don &apos;t want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .
thank you .
but i had to ri@@ g it with str@@ and@@ s of gl@@ ue .
this staff repres@@ ented three things about moses &apos; life .
so we know that there &apos;s lots of cro@@ ws .
in one community , we &apos;re told , you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used che@@ wing g@@ um paper .
they go through this very stri@@ king motion that is focused on these little red spots .
a trick shared by the largest flower on earth .
i was bur@@ ned very bad@@ ly .
today , the average kore@@ an works a thousand hours more a year than the average ger@@ man -- a thousand .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much rema@@ ins to be discovered .
good to see you , sir . you have a ring , a watch .
thir@@ ty-@@ two species have not been identi@@ fied or found in the state since 1950 .
we &apos;re now right into the 196@@ 0s .
that this travel@@ ed into the good@@ will in virginia , and moved its way into the larger industry , which at that point was giving millions of tons of secon@@ d@@ hand clothing to africa and asia .
and the local finan@@ cing is not part of the ecosystem for suppor@@ ting hardware projects .
to insi@@ st that they choose indepen@@ d@@ ently might actually com@@ promise both their performance and their relationships .
they send him to iraq .
and the patients started dri@@ fting in .
the governments of the world are taking this really seri@@ ously .
now , that &apos;s fine for the commercial software industry .
so they went out and they model@@ ed a computer model of a sand dun@@ e .
many think that afghanistan here and con@@ go , which have suff@@ ered sever@@ e confli@@ cts , that they don &apos;t have fast population growth .
and so in japan , i began to experiment with people .
and that &apos;s what we did .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use in the future .
this is one i remember f@@ on@@ dly .
this is an unbelie@@ v@@ ably primitive emotional response .
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this .
thanks .
when iran &apos;s ide@@ ological impul@@ ses colli@@ ded with its strategi@@ c interests , the strategi@@ c interests always pre@@ vail@@ ed .
what &apos;s life all about ? why am i here ?
they understand , in that context , &quot; free . &quot; they understand &quot; free &quot; is an important essential part of the cultural ecolo@@ gy as well .
so that may be a very direct way that we see it happen .
i started ju@@ ggl@@ ing a long time ago , but long before that , i was a golfer , and that &apos;s what i was , a golfer .
i took a couple vict@@ ory la@@ ps in there .
and he showed that gas@@ ses such as co2 ab@@ sor@@ b heat , thus acting like a blan@@ ket warming earth &apos;s surface .
because that is what kno@@ pf is .
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .
he gives half of them vitamin b@@ 12 .
tony bla@@ ir being used as a moun@@ ting block , and rum@@ s@@ feld and bush laugh@@ ing with some ab@@ u gh@@ ra@@ i@@ b photos behind , and the seri@@ ousness , or the intelle@@ ct , of bush .
thank you very much .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you &apos;ll see those res@@ ort hotels in or@@ bit .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the ne@@ west thing in alternative or traditional thera@@ pi@@ es for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small hi@@ ll . i couldn &apos;t climb a flight of stairs .
and we really love being close to the art center , because we have , as a matter of fact , one of the al@@ um@@ n@@ i from the art center , eric ny@@ qu@@ ist , had put a series of disp@@ la@@ ys , far@@ -@@ out disp@@ la@@ ys , you know , in our what we call mission design or spac@@ e@@ craft design room , just to get people to think wil@@ dly about things .
it &apos;s important because if you solve these problems , you can solve the problems of poverty in the world .
here &apos;s another little flower -- different range of ultra@@ vio@@ let frequ@@ en@@ cies , different fil@@ ters to match the pollin@@ ators .
and that &apos;s what i do with my furniture .
and i saw miss e@@ the@@ l j@@ . ban@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high-@@ he@@ els to elem@@ entary school every day .
acu@@ men came in with the patient capital , and we also helped to identify the entrepr@@ en@@ eur that we would all partner with here in africa , and ex@@ xon provi@@ ded the ini@@ tial resi@@ n .
and he finally asked , &quot; can i see those ? &quot;
it &apos;s incredible that we actually lived through all that .
but that one word made a really big difference .
so here &apos;s the behind the scen@@ es , a couple of little sh@@ ots here .
most are non-@@ violent and they fall into two bro@@ ad categ@@ ories : active engagement with ethni@@ c ri@@ val@@ ries and religious belie@@ fs and fair , transpar@@ ent economic development and provi@@ sion@@ ing of services .
pat@@ ent tro@@ ll@@ s have done more damage to the united states economy than any domestic or foreign every year .
i start speaking english , learning english , about a year ago .
ah , dam@@ n , i wanted to end exactly on time , but i got eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two -- so thank you very much . that &apos;s my talk , thank you .
and if so , how did they make arran@@ ge@@ ments ?
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . green .
je@@ an-@@ ba@@ pti@@ ste mi@@ ch@@ el : so how did we get to this conclusion ?
it was oxygen . i was lucky enough to have studied at the ju@@ illi@@ ard school in manhattan , and to have played my de@@ but with zu@@ bin me@@ h@@ ta and the isra@@ el@@ i phi@@ l@@ harmon@@ ic orchestra in tel avi@@ v , and it turned out that got@@ t@@ fri@@ ed sch@@ lau@@ g had studied as an organ@@ ist at the vi@@ en@@ na conser@@ v@@ at@@ ory , but had given up his love for music to pur@@ sue a career in medicine . and that after@@ no@@ on , i had to ask him , &quot; how was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
graphic designer stefan sag@@ meister takes the audience on a wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal journey through moments of his life that made him happy -- and notes how many of these moments have to do with good design .
what am i going to do ? i &apos;m going to do something to make a difference . so , when i was 17 , i went out one day on than@@ k@@ s@@ giving . it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families .
you have to choose to believe in hope .
and when freu@@ d discovered his sense of the un@@ conscious , it had a vast effect on the climate of the times .
the literature -- one part of it , the scientific literature -- consi@@ st@@ ently bl@@ ames et as being over@@ -@@ hy@@ ped and under@@ -@@ per@@ forming .
from these inter@@ lu@@ des come deep insi@@ ghts and amazing new appro@@ a@@ ches to sol@@ ving the problems that had them fru@@ strated just moments before .
so let &apos;s watch it . we &apos;ll go back , and i &apos;ll show you how we made it .
as far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 3@@ 50 colle@@ ges around the world teaching video game courses .
then you have to up@@ date your model based on the signals coming back , and you have to do something that is interesting , which is you have to do a kind of dep@@ th of thought as@@ say .
that &apos;s the good news .
so that encoura@@ ged him , and he went with mai@@ tre@@ ya .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
the soldi@@ er on the right has the name of his daughter tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed across his ch@@ est , as a re@@ min@@ der of home .
and we &apos;ve seen a new disease , not like the 30 no@@ vel emerging communi@@ c@@ able diseases .
we &apos;re only just beginning to understand how the physical oce@@ ano@@ graphy and the biological oce@@ ano@@ graphy come together to create a seas@@ on@@ al force that actually causes the up@@ w@@ elling that might make a hot spot a hope spot .
in fact , we don &apos;t even know what any of these objects say , and that &apos;s because the indu@@ s script is un@@ deci@@ pher@@ ed .
and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because fre@@ a@@ ks get published .
this is actually a real ad@@ verti@@ se@@ ment for rat po@@ is@@ on from the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s , and if you see , under the word &quot; cle@@ ars &quot; -- very small -- it says , &quot; they must go , &quot; which re@@ fers not only to the rats , but to the chinese in their mid@@ st , because the way that the food was per@@ cei@@ ved was that these people who ate fo@@ ods different from us must be different from us .
all the cameras were , of course , on sophi@@ a .
so anyway , two years sort of passed , and they had a child of their own , and then another two years passed , and they had another child of their own , and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident , which i thought was an unusual name .
at the top are mathematics and languages , then the humani@@ ties , and the bottom are the arts .
they could enjoy all the benefits of the sun@@ light and have roots going down into the ocean ; life then could fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh much more .
but what it means to have a brain there is that , not only the big brain has to talk with the food , the food has to talk with the brain , because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .
and then it cool@@ ed down to a bri@@ ck@@ -@@ hard sub@@ stance , that when you li@@ t that , it went off like a bat .
they &apos;re back in philadelphia .
so , we got milk , for the american audience .
i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on brie@@ fly .
ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z : the next species of human
we ur@@ g@@ ently need to change this .
keith bel@@ lo@@ ws : the cam@@ el &apos;s hum@@ p
we have reason to be afraid of mel@@ ting ice ca@@ ps .
but there &apos;s a problem , because up until maybe a decade ago , we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible mira@@ cle in the universe .
and we were helped by the market in@@ effici@@ ency .
and in so many ways , i think this is a terri@@ fic liber@@ ation .
and picture , if you will , a bil@@ l@@ board , a digital bil@@ l@@ board , where you have elements that can be either li@@ t or not .
so with deep hu@@ mi@@ lity , and for your appro@@ val , we present &quot; clou@@ d@@ bur@@ st . &quot;
you get your board cer@@ tifi@@ cate , and you can go out into practice .
there &apos;s the definition as you type .
those trying to emplo@@ y them think they don &apos;t know enough .
so , they moved the entire village , hu@@ t by hu@@ t .
bush &apos;s bi@@ got@@ ry was not an is@@ ol@@ ated mi@@ sta@@ ke , bl@@ ur@@ ted out in the heat of the moment and later re@@ tra@@ cted .
scientists think now our magne@@ tic field may be di@@ mini@@ shed by about five percent .
no , i &apos;m being told , &quot; no . &quot;
this way , even if the physics i work on comes to nothing , i still know i &apos;ve lived a good life .
and they would re@@ com@@ mend other people &apos;s stories , and the game became more powerful than the goal .
this is a picture of tim , who , right when i s@@ na@@ pped this picture , re@@ minded me , he said , &quot; j@@ essi@@ ca , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fiel@@ d@@ work in the co@@ sta ri@@ can rain@@ forest , and things have changed dramatically for me . &quot;
&quot; impossible to follow the dam@@ n thing , where &apos;s a dire@@ ct@@ ory ? &quot;
we are ben@@ ding the curve .
or even better , &quot; let me get one of the green kids who are already profi@@ cient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tu@@ tor their pe@@ er . &quot;
and if you go back in time to fe@@ bru@@ ary 3@@ rd , it looked like hil@@ ary clin@@ ton was going to get the democra@@ tic nom@@ ination .
and these things don &apos;t stay in the center of gravity , but over time , they gravi@@ tate there .
thank you .
thank you .
the first is collabor@@ ation .
and there &apos;s dan e@@ tete .
one was that my favorite nurse , et@@ tie , told me that i did not take her pain into consider@@ ation .
and what about the tri@@ angle ?
where are the office sound plan@@ ners ?
&quot; do you think government should &quot; — especially if you use loaded language -- &quot; do you think the government should provide hand@@ ou@@ ts ? &quot;
so it comes from the south@@ west . it &apos;s a south@@ west mon@@ soon .
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizar@@ re .
all of these kids in blan@@ kets bel@@ ong in in@@ cu@@ bat@@ ors -- something like this . so this is a don@@ ated japanese at@@ om in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or that we found in a ni@@ c@@ u in ka@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u .
with innova@@ tions like the great western , we can stre@@ tch that balance to the absolute li@@ mit .
and we said we could re@@ design the 1@@ 15@@ -@@ year-old gyp@@ sum dr@@ y@@ wall process that gener@@ ates 20 billion pounds of co2 a year .
and i call it &quot; h@@ ells and hea@@ v@@ ens &quot; because it &apos;s da@@ ily h@@ ells and da@@ ily hea@@ v@@ ens .
most of the animals are in the oceans .
now , you don &apos;t find any k@@ und ; they are all sub@@ mer@@ ged .
the difference is main@@ ly ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating the desert for food , or maybe golf courses in scot@@ ts@@ d@@ ale , you take your pick .
harvard medical school once -- i was at a talk -- director of the lab said , &quot; in our lab , we have a saying .
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to repli@@ cate the experiments that are descri@@ bed in print .
it has 40 different components put together by other people .
you can &apos;t just look at the d@@ ess@@ ert c@@ art as say , &quot; no , no , no . that looks dis@@ gu@@ sting to me . &quot;
now both of these options -- the boy geni@@ us and the sc@@ am@@ mer -- and therefore more pr@@ one to taking even bigger risks in the future .
now let &apos;s see if mark a@@ vo@@ i@@ ds it .
how many eng@@ ines on the wing of that bo@@ eing ?
i make a rural woman to compe@@ te with multina@@ tion@@ als .
so when i stand in these legs , my ham@@ str@@ ing and my gl@@ utes are contra@@ cted , as they would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .
we can just run an experiment .
it was all just gone .
for example , in land use , which areas do you want to protect , through ad@@ ding a se@@ a@@ wall , for example , alter , by rais@@ ing buildings , or re@@ treat from , to allow the mi@@ gra@@ tion of important natural systems , such as we@@ t@@ lands or bea@@ ches ?
there , you really did see the intelligence of the web mani@@ fest itself .
and this one &apos;s particularly interesting , because , of all the gl@@ aci@@ ers in north america , it recei@@ ves the highest volume of human traffic in a year .
it has acceler@@ ome@@ try . you can pl@@ u@@ g in a three-@@ lead ec@@ g .
recor@@ ding : hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine z@@ f : so that &apos;s one of the better ones , really .
wi@@ t@@ ness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before , 9@@ .@@ 4 years on average , in mar@@ ch . a record .
we need to emplo@@ y technology to assi@@ st us in this qu@@ est .
in the country once known for its pas@@ sive re@@ sig@@ nation , where , as bad as things got , only four percent expres@@ sed their opinion to a public offi@@ cial , today 90 percent tell us that if there &apos;s a problem in their community , it &apos;s up to them to fix it .
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn &apos;t p@@ an out .
a very un@@ likely spo@@ k@@ es@@ person for the idea of separ@@ ation of church and state .
now that very idea , i think , stri@@ kes ter@@ ror in many people , or an@@ ger , or anxi@@ ety of one sort or another .
and the what , i think , is that we returned , over and over again , to the pre-@@ cam@@ brian world , that first micro@@ bi@@ al age , and the microbes are still out there .
but it &apos;s when you comp@@ are the last two groups , the mi@@ d-@@ adol@@ es@@ cent group and the adult group where things get really interesting , because there , there is no continued improv@@ ement in the no@@ -@@ director condi@@ tion .
tried to figure out how to save americans after bat@@ tle@@ field in@@ ju@@ ries .
and it was the only instrument that , of all the ones that i play , that would really make that connection .
i &apos;d spo@@ ken in som@@ alia , bur@@ und@@ i , gaz@@ a , the west bank , india , sr@@ i lan@@ ka , con@@ go , wh@@ er@@ ever it was , and they &apos;d all tell me , &quot; if you can create a window of opportunity , we can move aid , we can vac@@ cin@@ ate children .
we are all now deeply , deeply , deeply inter@@ connected .
automo@@ bil@@ es are self-@@ moving things , right ? el@@ ev@@ ators are automo@@ bil@@ es .
i &apos;d never seen that before , but he did .
um , yeah .
and these voices will be ac@@ compani@@ ed by photographs that they took for us of their lives , of the things that they value and care about .
and then they will come and wor@@ ship this pon@@ d , pay respect , their gra@@ titude .
and i began to gras@@ p why it &apos;s said that the koran is really the koran only in ar@@ abi@@ c .
and in the case of the accident , where she thought that it was sugar , but it was really po@@ is@@ on and so she caused a death , people say that it was less okay , she deser@@ ves more bl@@ ame .
e : happy birthday to you .
for example , when i walked up here and i took the micro@@ phone from the stand and swi@@ tched it on , you as@@ sum@@ ed this was a micro@@ phone , which it is not .
so he said , &quot; alli@@ son , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
this is basically scientific data that you &apos;re looking at .
i have one gram , five gram , 10 gram . how many gram do you want ? &quot;
there &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .
and one of the things obama did , was they fam@@ ously , the obama campaig@@ n did , was they fam@@ ously put up my@@ bar@@ ac@@ ko@@ ba@@ ma@@ .com , my@@ bo@@ .com and millions of citizens ru@@ shed in to participa@@ te , and to try and figure out how to help .
inter@@ agency physi@@ cians come out .
this is an image from our first patient .
t@@ m : all right . you all got a couple of these in your gift ba@@ gs , and one of the first things , the production version seemed to di@@ ve a little bit , and so i would just suggest you ben@@ d the wing ti@@ ps up a little bit before you try flying it .
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emp@@ ha@@ size it and make it more important .
does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain ?
make sure you use a different pass@@ word on each of your sites and services online .
this , unfortunately , is basically two pictures .
so the techni@@ cian takes the instru@@ ctions .
what does a vi@@ oli@@ n have to do with technology ?
so here is where we were after the first gradu@@ ation in 2004 .
one of the ear@@ liest was this pattern , this fol@@ ded pattern , studied by kor@@ yo mi@@ ur@@ a , a japanese engineer .
young boys are taught justi@@ fi@@ cations for su@@ i@@ cide attac@@ ks and the execu@@ tion of spi@@ es .
and this took care of the situation res@@ o@@ und@@ ingly .
okay . all right .
sort of an interesting thing .
&quot; baby girl , someday the world will be in trouble .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up@@ -@@ to-@@ the@@ -@@ minute 17@@ th century technology -- to turn no@@ uns into verb@@ s .
john ho@@ d@@ g@@ man : ali@@ ens , love -- where are they ?
the reason why this is all happening is due to this , these are the four ways to go .
but it turns out , it doesn &apos;t remind me of the thing i thought it would ; it re@@ minds me constantly of something else instead .
after i bru@@ shed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- i finally was now accep@@ ted , and worked there for some six months .
the mc@@ lar@@ en just po@@ pped off and sc@@ rat@@ ched the side pan@@ el .
well , it &apos;s the era of a lot of different things that we &apos;re in right now . but one thing for sure : it &apos;s the era of change . there &apos;s more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth .
well-@@ func@@ tioning markets provide choices , and ultimately , the ability to ex@@ press one &apos;s pur@@ suit for happiness .
this is because time doesn &apos;t flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
the law re@@ quir@@ es accoun@@ t@@ ability .
in what language ? certainly not the language of mathematics , in which , g@@ ali@@ le@@ o ri@@ ghtly said , the book of nature is written .
she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ vor@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she continued her medical work .
and i always say to the students and post-@@ do@@ cs i le@@ cture to , don &apos;t be arro@@ gan@@ t , because arro@@ gan@@ ce kil@@ ls curi@@ o@@ sity .
there were no anim@@ ators necessary to come in and interpre@@ t behavior or en@@ h@@ ance his performance .
one of the guys i hi@@ red was an engineer named jack dor@@ sey , and a year later , when we were trying to decide which way to go with o@@ de@@ o , jack pres@@ ented an idea he &apos;d been tin@@ k@@ ering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status up@@ dat@@ es to friends .
none . none .
but here &apos;s a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
and i remember the hor@@ ror of seeing this little female devi@@ l with this huge ul@@ cer@@ ating , f@@ ou@@ l-@@ sm@@ elling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cra@@ cked off her entire lower ja@@ w .
people who are v@@ cs or angel@@ s investing in you have had experience and they &apos;d like to know that you want to hear that experience .
and i &apos;ve looked glob@@ ally , i &apos;ve taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years , and looked to see what the relationship is .
joseph k@@ im : the family i lost in north korea . and the family i ga@@ ined .
there &apos;s a lot of work to be done after that .
don &apos;t just talk about it at ted . this is a nation@@ wide policy agen@@ da i &apos;m trying to build , and as you all know , politics are personal .
it &apos;s l@@ oud , clear -- you can hear it very clearly .
because we all knew that just six years earlier , half as many penguins had been o@@ iled and res@@ cu@@ ed and only half of them had survived .
she also embra@@ ced violence .
if you ever go bar hop@@ ping , who do you want to take with you ?
very little emp@@ ha@@ sis on ethi@@ cs , and the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of enti@@ tle@@ ment than a sense of responsibility .
and i had time to rela@@ x and to g@@ rie@@ ve .
artists too love to play around with symme@@ try .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : oh my god . oh my god ! are you kid@@ ding me ? other scientists : oh ho ho ! that &apos;s just han@@ ging there .
for our au@@ ction we have some wonderful pain@@ t@@ ings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
we cannot keep giving l@@ enti@@ ls to people . &quot;
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
you just qu@@ it school and come there . &quot;
the master of shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts -- it &apos;s , of course , nature .
and so i appli@@ ed to cal@@ tech and they turned me down .
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities .
they are over 2@@ ,000 years old .
why aren &apos;t we doing it ? simply because nobody thought of it yet .
here is the site in 19@@ 40 : it was just a little farm in the village of hy@@ at@@ ts@@ ville .
it &apos;s not a movie . this is real life .
we &apos;re human beings .
and that &apos;s because , in contra@@ st with cr@@ ony capi@@ tali@@ sm , so much of what globali@@ zation and the technology revolution have done is highly positive .
the work@@ place , we haven &apos;t really talked about it .
the first is , &quot; to live , to er@@ r , to fall , to trium@@ ph and to re@@ create life out of life . &quot;
so here he is now , back in israel where he lives , three months after the proce@@ d@@ ure , and here he is .
now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectu@@ al community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; wrong &quot; in boston or pal@@ o al@@ to , who are we to say that the proud deni@@ zens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and daugh@@ ters to live in cl@@ oth ba@@ gs ?
now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on s@@ ale in a major economy such as to@@ k@@ yo , london or new york .
and i don &apos;t know what you expect , but when i was thinking about that issue , i early on realized what i &apos;m not able to give you are answers .
so in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when i began in 1960 .
now , i have to do something -- first of all , switch to real glasses so i can actually see you , which would probably be a conveni@@ ence . i don &apos;t know .
so fl@@ ur@@ ry of phone calls and e@@ mails from the new york times .
and to make that , it invol@@ ves extre@@ mes of temper@@ ature , extre@@ mes of pressure and loads of pollu@@ tion .
it &apos;s a ro@@ tten neighborhood . your first consider@@ ation is , am i gon@@ na get beat up ? you go out and -- see this wall ?
this is the tn@@ c network which we analy@@ zed .
some things he showed as a celebra@@ tion at the very end .
in my view , it &apos;s not the photograph@@ er who makes the photo , it &apos;s you .
your kids are easy to train .
another rock came into the earth &apos;s atmosphere and this one ble@@ w up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the earth .
it was a to@@ y gun .
so a very diver@@ se group of people .
they saw their first denti@@ st , they ate their first ham@@ bur@@ ger , and they had their first kids .
anyway , i did this house in s@@ anta mon@@ i@@ ca , and it got a lot of not@@ ori@@ ety .
and quite fran@@ k@@ ly , we &apos;re putting our heads in the sand .
and then we decided to help people out of poverty , now that we got aids some@@ what out of the way -- this time , not with government alone , but in co@@ operation with the business community .
we put it in place so we knew it was an accu@@ rate position .
and nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the european union , whose 27 member countries speak 23 offi@@ cial languages .
artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult .
you can walk there today .
this is just the out@@ line of it , and you can see , does it look like a regular building ? no .
and as i went to research that even further , i got to a point where i discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothe@@ sis .
we know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up fo@@ unding he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ p@@ ack@@ ard .
res@@ ur@@ re@@ ction might succe@@ ed for the body , but not for the mind .
and so it &apos;s not something -- happiness is not something you get , health is generally not something that you get .
so from this experience of my re@@ co@@ very , i want to share four particular aspe@@ cts -- i call them the four c &apos;s of consciousness -- that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day .
because we want africa to be rich .
so if i going to be asked to put my life on the line , then front me the c@@ ash , man . &quot;
this is underneath my al@@ ma m@@ ater , colum@@ bia university .
but , if we start to understand that cancer isn &apos;t just a molecular defe@@ ct , it &apos;s something more , then we &apos;ll get to new ways of treating it , as i &apos;ll show you .
the high is the average of 10@@ 3 scientific , peer-@@ re@@ viewed studies .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
well , you know , it was beginn@@ er french , that i am taking with her , you know .
and there was some conc@@ ern that in some parts of the country there might be vot@@ er supp@@ res@@ sion .
so purple is &quot; fighting , &quot; and red is &quot; giving money away , &quot; and green is &quot; profi@@ te@@ ering . &quot;
they don &apos;t necessarily even have to go into some kind of for@@ mal workshop to do it .
now in the last 50 years , we americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want . we &apos;re ri@@ cher .
and they &apos;re learning to become like us .
six ? five ? four ?
i am trying to suggest that , for 4@@ 0-@@ odd years , this a@@ qu@@ atic idea has been mi@@ sc@@ at@@ eg@@ ori@@ zed as lun@@ atic fr@@ inge , and it is not lun@@ atic fr@@ inge .
now , my hypothe@@ sis , because everybody always as@@ ks me , is this .
the next step of evolution in mamm@@ als and creatures with di@@ vin@@ ely super@@ flu@@ ous neurons will be to play .
you can see a modern road , har@@ dly 50 years old .
the important thing here is that this is not a one-@@ way tri@@ p , as in most dung be@@ et@@ les . the tri@@ p here is re@@ pe@@ ated back and forth between a provi@@ sion@@ ing site and a nest site .
in a li@@ vely show , mathe@@ magi@@ cian arth@@ ur benjamin ra@@ ces a team of calcul@@ ators to figure out 3@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it squ@@ ar@@ es , sol@@ ves another massive mental equation and gu@@ esses a few birth@@ days . how does he do it ? he &apos;ll tell you .
francis c@@ oll@@ ins : we need better drugs -- now
instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
and it &apos;s a li@@ vely and a lo@@ vely place , but we &apos;re rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our over@@ fishing , our ir@@ responsible fishing , our ad@@ ding of pollu@@ tants like fertili@@ zer from our cro@@ pl@@ and , but also , most recently , with climate change , and steve schnei@@ der , i &apos;m sure , will be going into greater detail on this .

at ted@@ women , tony por@@ ter makes a call to men everywhere : don &apos;t &quot; act like a man . &quot; telling powerful stories from his own life , he shows how this ment@@ ality , dru@@ mm@@ ed into so many men and boys , can lead men to dis@@ respect , mi@@ stre@@ at and ab@@ use women and each other . his solution : break free of the &quot; man box . &quot;
and we &apos;ll place an ac@@ ou@@ stic tag that says , &quot; om@@ shark 10@@ 1@@ 65 , &quot; or something like that , ac@@ ou@@ stically with a ping .
our life lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty is going up almost a year for every year that pas@@ ses .
dou@@ g ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter won@@ ders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smar@@ ter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
you just have to look at your skin .
but right in the middle here where there &apos;s a sweet spot , the noise is dom@@ inated by human ships .
this man is an@@ gr@@ y because somebody thre@@ w oni@@ ons all over the sta@@ ir@@ case , and basically -- you know , i guess oni@@ ons are a the@@ me here .
but without data , those models will never ever be predi@@ cted .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
and of course , since happiness -- we want &quot; joy to the world . &quot;
and then he had these two women who were travel@@ ing with him who were pretty sen@@ ior in his department , and i kind of said to them , &quot; sit at the table . come on , sit at the table , &quot; and they s@@ at on the side of the room .
this gra@@ in of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old , and it &apos;s never ero@@ ded away like the way we have sand on earth ero@@ des away because of water and tum@@ bling , air , and so forth . all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun , has these solar stor@@ ms , and that &apos;s erosion by solar radiation .
this is the natural history of heart disease , but it &apos;s really not natural because we found it could get better and better , and much more quickly than people had once thought .
and actually , we changed completely our flight plan .
we had somebody from public health . and de@@ v@@ du@@ tt also men@@ tioned public health .
i &apos;m going to have a couple of be@@ ers and a ban@@ ana nu@@ t mu@@ ff@@ in .
and from the beginning of today &apos;s ses@@ sions you &apos;d think that they &apos;re going to see this as this horri@@ ble difficult , pain@@ ful period that we stru@@ ggl@@ ed through .
and to this day , i am ambi@@ valent , but when you have instead games like flow , there &apos;s no dou@@ bt .
there &apos;s clearly se@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ro@@ cks all over the place – one of the l@@ anders is sitting in the middle of an ancient se@@ ab@@ ed , and there are these amazing structures called blu@@ e@@ ber@@ ries , which are these little , ro@@ cky con@@ cre@@ tions that we are bu@@ sy making biologi@@ cally in my lab right now .
and we must re@@ build these forests .
and when a number of fil@@ am@@ ents come together in a k@@ not , that makes a super@@ cluster of galaxies .

that was in the early 200@@ 0s when india was going g@@ ung@@ -@@ ho about gd@@ p growth as the means forward -- looking at china with its st@@ el@@ lar grow@@ ths of eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering , why can we do the same ?
people can come live under the new char@@ ter , but no one is for@@ ced to live under it .
and what do they do with that money ?
of course , you got it wrong .
the vision of that which has already been pro@@ ven or can be as@@ cer@@ ta@@ ined .
you get more money because your terms of trade have improved , but also that dri@@ ves up out@@ put across the board .
but what was cool was that the re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions now for green@@ peace was , they created an entire marketing campaig@@ n around it .
the black line represents predi@@ ctions for phosphorus reser@@ ves .
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most biolumin@@ escence occur@@ s .
people aren &apos;t just cooking any@@ more -- they &apos;re cooking , tex@@ ting , talking on the phone , watching youtube and up@@ lo@@ ading photos of the a@@ wes@@ ome me@@ al they just made . designer pa@@ ol@@ o car@@ din@@ i questions the effici@@ ency of our multi@@ t@@ asking world and makes the case for -- gas@@ p -- &quot; mon@@ ot@@ asking . &quot; his &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; h@@ tt@@ p : / / ww@@ w@@ .@@ thin@@ gi@@ ver@@ se@@ .com / thing : 2@@ 6@@ 5@@ 7@@ 8 &quot; target = &quot; _ blank &quot; &amp; gt ; char@@ ming 3d-@@ prin@@ ted smar@@ t@@ phone co@@ vers &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; just might help .

right now , it feels like i for@@ got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gra@@ y and it seems like the world is sp@@ inning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am sp@@ inning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe now everybody s@@ ings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe thank you .
so if we give you a speci@@ fi@@ cation , this brain , which is auton@@ om@@ ous , have 500 million ner@@ ve cells , 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain , so there sle@@ e@@ ps a little cat -- thinks for itself , optimi@@ zes whatever it di@@ ge@@ sts .
that &apos;s where he discovered something totally magi@@ cal , and when he talks about it , it &apos;s fascinating -- it &apos;s the magic of dy@@ eing chemistry .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
i &apos;ll give you an idea .
a che@@ er@@ y thought .
i was walking from the el@@ ev@@ ator over here , and even just looking at the stage right now -- so there &apos;s probably 20 500 watt lights right now .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ ch@@ em@@ ist turned budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ k mat@@ thi@@ e@@ u ri@@ card says we can train our minds in hab@@ its of well-@@ being , to generate a true sense of ser@@ en@@ ity and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
i and my colleagues art aron and lu@@ cy brown and others , have put 3@@ 7 people who are ma@@ dly in love into a functional mri brain scan@@ ner .
that &apos;s not a cause . that &apos;s an emergen@@ cy .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not possible to feed , clo@@ the and house us all and have us live de@@ cent lives .
what do you think of fo@@ ie gr@@ as that 99@@ .@@ 99@@ 99@@ 9 percent of the world e@@ ats ?
so i looked at the countries whose students perform well academi@@ cally , and looked at what they &apos;re doing to help their teachers improve .
to@@ d@@ d ku@@ i@@ ken : a prosthe@@ tic arm that &quot; feels &quot;
you can find four or five pas@@ sa@@ ges in the bible of this il@@ k .
as an neuro@@ scientist , this was especially con@@ f@@ using , because according to all the theori@@ es out there , when your expe@@ c@@ tations are not met , you should alter them .
this is a dust mi@@ te on a nan@@ ore@@ pli@@ ca .
then you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much rock we &apos;re talking about , okay ?
there &apos;s a cover story all about the great explor@@ ers of our time .
and i thought , in the beginning -- i studied this bird for a couple of years -- that , well , shouldn &apos;t the brain of this bird be dama@@ ged ?
the next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for your@@ selves and for everyone . thanks so much .
and because we don &apos;t know our prefer@@ ences that well we &apos;re su@@ sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to all of these influ@@ ences from the ex@@ tern@@ al forces : the de@@ fau@@ l@@ ts , the particular options that are pres@@ ented to us , and so on .
it was then that i decided i would take up the gun -- for those men and women who came to liber@@ ate us -- from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil .
and i guess that &apos;s the main reason i came up here today , to all of you very bright people at ted , is to say , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
it &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
though it was based on very little evidence , many scientists thought that all mamm@@ ali@@ an brains , including the human brain , were made in the same way , with a number of neurons that was always propor@@ tional to the size of the brain .
and john ma@@ e@@ da was supposed to show several graphic ani@@ ma@@ tions in this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
there &apos;s no dinosau@@ rs yet ; just this slow , sau@@ ri@@ an , sc@@ al@@ y , na@@ sty , swa@@ mp@@ y place with a couple of tiny mamm@@ als hi@@ ding in the fr@@ ing@@ es .
but when it &apos;s something other than water , and their water habitat changes , they don &apos;t have many options .
there is now a new career path called sto@@ ol don@@ or .
and in fact , i think my the@@ sis here is that belief is the natural state of things .
the cre@@ ator doesn &apos;t have any rights .
it goes like this .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named jose@@ p@@ hat by@@ ar@@ u@@ han@@ ga , who was another acu@@ men fund fellow , who ha@@ ils from uganda , a far@@ ming community .
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has g@@ uns .
and when they went i@@ p@@ o , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never tra@@ ded above 10 .
a-@@ ha ! i mean , it really is a strange in@@ version of reas@@ oning .
this is a tre@@ ph@@ inated skul@@ l .
ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es were port@@ able . you could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , dank inter@@ ior into a rich@@ ly col@@ ored setting .
&quot; ... but . i had a dream too , once , kid , but i was afraid to pur@@ sue it . &quot;
and these are the so-called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
again , i don &apos;t know where inspiration comes from .
tonight you &apos;ll see some of our invented st@@ ents .
and that &apos;s not always going to happen in physical spaces .
and i have a question : &quot; well , what do you mean ?
and the system was capable of doing very , very large docum@@ ent@@ ation systems over computer networks .
love is something you discover .
in the same time , the number of for@@ -@@ profi@@ ts that cros@@ sed it is 4@@ 6@@ ,@@ 13@@ 6 .
and , despite being cur@@ sed with my athle@@ tic in@@ ability , he pla@@ ys so@@ c@@ cer .
this is how close we are with this world .
on top of this , when you get so many animals so close together , it creates a bre@@ eding ground for disease and opportunities for har@@ m and ab@@ use .
james bal@@ o@@ g : ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se pro@@ of of extreme ice loss

so , we study the holi@@ stic health experience of 1,000 sen@@ i@@ ors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
to give you one example of the impact this can have , this little boy , eight years old , walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clin@@ ic put on by the comfort .
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak flu@@ ent japanese and i know ja@@ v@@ as@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
so , we can provide the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost means of going wir@@ eless co@@ a@@ st-@@ to-@@ coast , we can have resili@@ ent nation@@ wide communication systems , we have a new tool for creating effici@@ en@@ cies in all se@@ ctors .
even har@@ der was getting pain@@ t to stick to the ac@@ id in a gra@@ pe@@ fru@@ it .

which sandwi@@ ch is he going to take ?
how old it is ?
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i &apos;m tou@@ ching the paper .
the strange one looks li@@ kes this : that we live in a three-@@ dimensional world .
that actually for a given body mass of a pri@@ mate the met@@ abo@@ lic rate was sta@@ tic .
they &apos;d given me a large gr@@ ant when i was an academi@@ cian for the study of fel@@ ony dr@@ unken dri@@ vers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
do you know what i wanted to be ?
and i think magic , whether i &apos;m holding my bre@@ ath or shu@@ ff@@ ling a de@@ ck of car@@ ds , is pretty simple .
and i realized , oh my god . this is what i &apos;ve been doing for 20 years .
they end up being very large pictures , and i photograph@@ ed with a very large camera -- an 8@@ x@@ 10 camera .
this is a very ligh@@ t@@ weight suit . it wei@@ gh@@ s about 15 pounds .
there &apos;s something we believe that just , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
if the weak force had been a little bit different , then carbon and oxygen wouldn &apos;t be stable inside the hearts of stars , and there would be none of that in the universe .
and that de@@ e@@ per , underlying point is that science is in the process of re@@ defin@@ ing life as we know it .
there &apos;s one fellow out there , van pra@@ a@@ gh is his name , james van pra@@ a@@ gh .
a tiny airplane , the a@@ v poin@@ ter ser@@ ves for sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lance -- in effect , a pair of ro@@ ving e@@ ye@@ glasses . a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge example of where mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation can lead if the oper@@ ator is remote from the vehicle . it is conveni@@ ent to carry , as@@ semble and la@@ unch by hand . batter@@ y-@@ power@@ ed , it is silent and r@@ ar@@ ely noticed .
i know . how many people have hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ ked within the past 10 years ?
these are largely hidden from the imm@@ une system .
just the m@@ ere fact of doing that fil@@ ls such a sense of ade@@ qu@@ ation with our deep nature .
i feel like h@@ ank a@@ aron . bar@@ ry bon@@ ds can re@@ place me any time .
using this technology , the speci@@ ali@@ sts at u@@ cl@@ a medical center were able to identify where that com@@ pression in the ho@@ se pi@@ pe was oc@@ curr@@ ing .
for us now at movember , we really focus on three program areas , and having a true impact : awareness and education , survi@@ vor support pro@@ grams , and research .
they &apos;ve funded research that shows that we can double global pal@@ m oil production without cu@@ tting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in bor@@ ne@@ o alone by plan@@ ting on land that &apos;s already degra@@ ded .
the decades ahead will see dramatic advan@@ ces in disease pre@@ vention , general health , the quality of life .
they &apos;re usually par@@ ked within 100 feet of the people that own them .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
trying to zi@@ g@@ za@@ g it to make sure that all of the a@@ part@@ ments look at the straight views , instead of into each other .
and they honor events in the linear world from the fi@@ c@@ tional world .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your coloni@@ es , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this se@@ gment of our industry .
now , this gives a real meaning to the term &quot; blind fai@@ th , &quot; which doesn &apos;t have the same negative con@@ not@@ ation for me that it does for other people .
fair enough .
that &apos;s the difference .
i &apos;m a spect@@ ro@@ scop@@ ist .
so i swa@@ m through the night , and at da@@ wn they got there and they started with pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one sh@@ ots .
and i think we are a clever species sometimes .
i saw my a@@ unt in ra@@ pe when i was only five .
there are also je@@ ts e@@ man@@ ating out from the center .
but maybe it just means you &apos;re more sensi@@ tive to what most people can &apos;t see or feel .
this is the phi@@ lo@@ den@@ dr@@ on s@@ ell@@ ou@@ m .
and then one of my favor@@ i@@ tes . what a face !
there &apos;s nothing funny or enter@@ taining about it , but i really wanted to take this issue on .
another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21@@ st century , we want to get away from the idea that power &apos;s always zero sum -- my ga@@ in is your loss and vi@@ ce ver@@ sa .
i was cover@@ ing the war in afghanistan , and i wi@@ tn@@ essed , as a repor@@ ter for al ja@@ ze@@ era , the amount of suffering and destru@@ ction that emer@@ ged out of a war like that .
it is the most fri@@ ghten@@ ing and pani@@ cky feeling that you can have .
now in india &apos;s case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .
and one of the the cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge areas that we &apos;re just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enter@@ pri@@ ses , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adap@@ tation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
this is what war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t &apos;s business partner charlie mun@@ ger calls &quot; a lat@@ ti@@ ce@@ work on which to hang your ideas . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; this is what we need , as a language . &quot;
so i said , &quot; forget that . i &apos;m the new gover@@ nor .
imagine a species that just didn &apos;t have this neu@@ ral machin@@ er@@ y for process@@ ing music .
if you make people self-@@ conscious about their jud@@ g@@ ments , studies show you will make them make worse jud@@ g@@ ments .
but the same may not be true if we &apos;re talking about non@@ material goo@@ ds and social practi@@ ces such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civi@@ c life .
and it fre@@ es up the nur@@ ses and the nurse &apos;s ai@@ des from doing that mun@@ dan@@ e work of just mechani@@ cally pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients .
so by now , i had developed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal meth@@ od , so i appli@@ ed that . i said , &quot; i haven &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot;
it has a little c@@ ough and a hi@@ c@@ c@@ up , and out comes spra@@ ys of little fro@@ gs .
but most important was that b@@ mi took public dom@@ ain works and made arran@@ ge@@ ments of them , which they gave away for free to their sub@@ scri@@ bers . so that in 19@@ 40 , when as@@ cap thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to double their rates , the maj@@ ority of broad@@ ca@@ sters swi@@ tched to b@@ mi .
more and more rules to protect us against an in@@ different , un@@ car@@ ing set of institutions we have to deal with .
and i &apos;m going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
they don &apos;t notice the beauty , but they don &apos;t even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun .
and yet their job descri@@ ption con@@ tains not one word about other human beings .
i can help you with those later .
and then he went to the top-@@ most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called mer@@ u .

and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relev@@ an@@ cy all of a sudden , and it was done right after 9 / 11 .
one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the fo@@ cal length of a con@@ ve@@ x lens .

this was another one i could not get a lo@@ aner of .
improv@@ ement is increasingly difficult to organi@@ ze ; our fai@@ th in these systems , incredibly fr@@ au@@ ght .

i hope it &apos;s not over .
thank you very much .
and in the developing world overall , that figure is 40 to 50 percent .
so i &apos;d like to share with you five simple exerci@@ ses , tools you can take away with you , to improve your own conscious listening .
ti@@ mes@@ har@@ ing is a little further off in the future .

and boy , they were like , &quot; what ? why ?
now i had this picture taken , and it was put up on my facebook page last week , and somebody wrote in , &quot; hu@@ h , why does he have him standing at attention like that ? &quot;
so this predi@@ cts that sen@@ sing the distan@@ ces and dire@@ ctions of boun@@ dar@@ ies around you -- exten@@ ded buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s .

as you would expect , it &apos;s a light , a des@@ k lamp .

you &apos;re changing the micro@@ structure of your brain as you go along .

and they should survive over there , on their own , in the future .
this technology has become out@@ d@@ ated in our current world .
i want you to allow your hand to stick fir@@ m@@ ly to the tab@@ le@@ top .
it &apos;s a scientific dri@@ ll@@ ing ves@@ sel .
but , what it all comes down to is this .
there is a simple in@@ put , it &apos;s always a cu@@ be that i start with , and it &apos;s a very simple operation -- it &apos;s making a fold , and doing this over and over again .
maybe the bar@@ rier would be too universal .
if i used someone else &apos;s pre-@@ death , i apo@@ logi@@ ze , i think i made it up .
the other things they &apos;ve worked on -- i didn &apos;t have time to say this in my talk -- is they &apos;ve re@@ stor@@ ed functional hearing to thousands of dea@@ f people .
we all went out and did a mission and we &apos;ve done three of them so far .

by looking at the propor@@ tions and combin@@ ations of different kinds of pollen in a sample , you can tell very preci@@ sely where it came from .
made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity .
and the reason is that cancer , like every cell in the body , places little molecular book@@ mar@@ ks , little post-@@ it notes , that remind the cell &quot; i &apos;m cancer ; i should keep growing . &quot;
and in fact , there are many surge@@ ons in the u.@@ k .
and it turns out that his tem@@ po@@ ral bones were harv@@ est@@ ed when he died to try to look at the cause of his de@@ af@@ ness , which is why he has mol@@ ding clay and his skul@@ l is bul@@ ging out on the side there .
what you want , what you want , what you want , is passion . it is beyond interest .
this was not an or@@ al history program .
and i looked at it , just said , &quot; y@@ u@@ ck , &quot; and go and work on the other side of the island .
and then an enormous accident took place .
so for me , car@@ to@@ oning gave me a sense of identi@@ ty .
a couple of quick rules to wra@@ p up .
and in fact , the numbers after that get , those get very difficult to count , because there just aren &apos;t any left .
and the best way to do that is with free c@@ and@@ y .
but i really like that , so i wrote a book called &quot; the la@@ ws of simpli@@ city . &quot;
the opposite , of course , is -- fake fake .
so far , they &apos;ve pac@@ ked up about 4@@ ,@@ 500 feet of ice cor@@ es for shi@@ pment back to the united states .

what would that system look like ?
it makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like web@@ sites , collabor@@ ative environ@@ ments -- you &apos;ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it &apos;s always pil@@ ot@@ ed first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , bi@@ ases the result .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they posi@@ tioned ?

there &apos;s also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neuro@@ logi@@ c diseases have a very low inci@@ dence of most can@@ cers .
and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that ch@@ ih@@ o showed us .
here is a soul which has got all the simpli@@ city of confidence .
there &apos;s the chip .
now he &apos;s put together some thoughts : about half of that he &apos;ll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , ta@@ xes will be appro@@ ved .
yet we have this idea , we humans , that the earth -- all of it : the oceans , the sk@@ ies -- are so vast and so resili@@ ent it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .
it &apos;s cool for me .
this is the sky@@ line of my home@@ town , new or@@ le@@ ans .
i didn &apos;t tell tony that . i didn &apos;t tell the pil@@ ots that .
and these are not es@@ ot@@ eric limits .
what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was re@@ adi@@ ly available on the local level .
so the ou@@ ter part of that brain is the neocortex .
i think our ten@@ den@@ cy is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
as i looked down at her in the bed , i thought to myself , if you just tried car@@ ing even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to am@@ pu@@ tate your foot .
i don &apos;t want to make this as a corpo@@ rate enti@@ ty .
it makes me incredibly fortun@@ ate to live at this moment in history .
so , i lo@@ cked myself in a room , figured out the content , organized the docum@@ ent , and wrote it in pla@@ in english .
now , who would you rather be if a ju@@ i@@ cy piece of go@@ ssi@@ p were spre@@ ading through the network ?

and i was the product of a work@@ ing-@@ class community .
it meant : &quot; i com@@ mit myself . i engage myself . &quot;
one approach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
but one of the reasons that ri@@ ot took place -- those ri@@ ots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the kosovo people were di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed from their own future .
and he took benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn &apos;t think he was going to go .
j@@ n : yeah .
so we ru@@ shed out to blas@@ ket as soon as we heard there were shar@@ ks there and managed to find some shar@@ ks .
n in the process of my research , i actually spent a bit of time in si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one resear@@ ching this .
so here is the &quot; thinking different &quot; bit .
you need a safe space .
i didn &apos;t have to try to fla@@ p my w@@ ings .
i did the 2@@ 3@@ and@@ me thing and was very surpri@@ sed to discover that i am fat and bald .
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we &apos;re going to go .
and so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot;
you immer@@ se yourself in the water , and a physical action bac@@ ks up a philosophi@@ cal idea .
people &apos;s lives are too complex , and who wants to do that ?
it &apos;s kind of living .
we &apos;re just pushing the body through the whole ct scan@@ ner , and just in a few seconds we can get a full-@@ body data set .
and how about the oil , gas and mining companies ?
he had seen people of different colors living in different places .
the first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to tat@@ too our faces .
finally , as a scientist and as a person and now , as part of the ted community , i feel that i have better tools to go out to trees , to go out to forests , to go out to nature , to make new discover@@ ies about nature -- and about humans &apos; place in nature wh@@ er@@ ever we are and wh@@ om@@ ever you are .
some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigan@@ tic private ya@@ chts .
and i just want to , very quickly , show you this .
so fir@@ stly , thinking just about pre@@ cogni@@ tion , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called dar@@ y@@ l be@@ m condu@@ cted a piece of research where he found evidence of pre@@ cognitive powers in under@@ graduate students , and this was published in a peer-@@ re@@ viewed academic journ@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; okay , well , fair enough , but i think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a fre@@ ak , because i know that if i did a study where i found no evidence that under@@ graduate students had pre@@ cognitive powers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journ@@ al .
he called it the god complex .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easi@@ er solution to this .
they , businesses , other citizens &apos; groups , have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings .
but we are ent@@ ering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
she said , &quot; she did . i can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was .
isra@@ el@@ i activ@@ ist : nothing sc@@ ar@@ es the army more than non@@ violent op@@ position .
there &apos;s an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this proce@@ d@@ ure , and so basically -- and what do they learn from it ?
&quot; sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
so really this is a story about the au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous plans of young people with these dre@@ ams . there are many of us .
now we &apos;ve swi@@ tched to critical mass .
and what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tat@@ too ever would ?
he wanted to sha@@ ke the president &apos;s hand .
how have we convin@@ ced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subje@@ cts worth consider@@ ing ?
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about and really , how do we get from where we are now to where we need to go ?
the guy did it all himself .
this is going to affect everything .
we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn &apos;t last forever , our sun doesn &apos;t last forever .
&quot; que@@ erer than we can suppose &quot; comes from j@@ .b@@ .@@ s. hal@@ dan@@ e , the famous biolo@@ gist , who said , &quot; now , my own su@@ spi@@ ci@@ on is that the universe is not only que@@ erer than we suppose , but que@@ erer than we can suppose .
and the worst idea we &apos;ve ever had is subur@@ ban spra@@ w@@ l .
so , here &apos;s the cause .
and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with mal@@ nutri@@ tion and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
this is a scan through the human for@@ ear@@ m . it &apos;s then blo@@ wn up through rapid prototy@@ ping to reve@@ al the cellu@@ lar structure . i have these in my office .
the second a@@ chil@@ les &apos; he@@ el is complexity -- a growing fragi@@ lity , a growing bri@@ tt@@ len@@ ess .
and unfortunately , for mort@@ als like you and me , we probably can &apos;t understand it very well .
and i don &apos;t think any of us has a full understanding of it , by any means .
now i &apos;m going to the ted wish -- is that okay ?
here , we have the brain of the animal .
but this is a fi@@ ve-@@ meter telescope -- has about a quar@@ ter-@@ mile fo@@ cal length .
then we &apos;d have to break into his dor@@ m room and then er@@ ase the ta@@ pe ? &quot;
if you read books of people who climb mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
i caught up with him recently , where , over the course of several cu@@ ps of tea , he told me how ho@@ sting gu@@ ests from all over the world has en@@ rich@@ ed his life .
so when steve jobs talks to 50,000 people at his key@@ note , right , who are all tun@@ ed in from 1@@ 30 countries watching his two-@@ hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing kee@@ ping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care des@@ per@@ ately enough to watch a two-@@ hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are activ@@ ely impro@@ ving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
it &apos;s the home@@ bre@@ w computer club -- just like a ha@@ cker@@ space .
and so , what technology gives us , over the long term , over the sort of exten@@ ded evolution -- from the beginning of time , through the inven@@ tion of the plants and animals , and the evolution of life , the evolution of brains -- what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences : it &apos;s increasing diversity , it &apos;s increasing options , it &apos;s increasing choices , opportunities , possibilities and fre@@ ed@@ oms .
but when we &apos;re re@@ lie@@ ved from that , we somehow then become interested in all the other beings .
several of these nutri@@ ents are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , ni@@ tro@@ gen and cal@@ ci@@ um .
we &apos;ve got several different species of agriculture coming along , and i &apos;m hoping that soon we &apos;ll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria .
while we initially her@@ al@@ ded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that reg@@ ard .
and nobody knew anything about it .
sort of having beginn@@ er &apos;s mind , sc@@ ra@@ ping your mind clean and looking at things af@@ res@@ h .
can i have sh@@ re@@ e and lau@@ ren come up really quickly ?
so these animals go into a mol@@ ting period where they &apos;re un@@ able to strike -- their bodies become very soft .
and she made a decision as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be en@@ for@@ ced and done to other women and girls .
we &apos;ve clu@@ tter@@ ed ourselves up with all this .
and that rover will be more kind of like a ch@@ em@@ ist .
so then , each time the big fish e@@ ats the little fish , he will incre@@ ment the score , and the score will go up by one .
they focus most of their re@@ cru@@ i@@ ting on the army , and they very open@@ ly ad@@ verti@@ se for better sal@@ ari@@ es , better benefits , better pro@@ motion pa@@ ths , not to men@@ tion much better food , than what the army can deli@@ ver .
but we have to do it in a way that is sensi@@ tive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future .
a lot of us work for people ; we &apos;re in the hands of other people .
but for any of these things to work , the hon@@ est@@ y in language , the local democracy , it &apos;s not just a question of what politi@@ cians do .
you know the so@@ vi@@ et architecture of that building is the conser@@ vation .
this is my grandfather .
let &apos;s say they do 30 miles per gall@@ on .
and my family moved out of an urban place , where we used to live , to a remote rural area where it was sa@@ fer .
now , l@@ est you think that this is only for the light at heart , or just temporary instal@@ lations , this is the same fir@@ m working at the world trade center , re@@ plac@@ ing the bridge that used to go across west street , that very important pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an connection between the city of new york and the re@@ development of the west side .

and then you deta@@ ch the protein and you get this film , as the proteins find each other as the water ev@@ a@@ por@@ ates .
it might take a few days to get there , but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reli@@ able quality .
why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
not only were they enthusi@@ a@@ stic , they kept thinking they &apos;re there to help us .

it turns out that the value of buying a lot@@ ter@@ y ticket is not w@@ inning .

if you &apos;re cre@@ m@@ ated , all those to@@ x@@ ins i men@@ tioned are released into the atmosphere .
what &apos;s the sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ?
well now , i know a lot of times we act like du@@ cks , but you &apos;re not a du@@ ck .
sometimes these might self-@@ as@@ semble in your g@@ i system and be au@@ g@@ mented in that reality .
for example , this is , of course , one of the most deli@@ ci@@ ous tricks in marketing , is to say something used to be higher , and suddenly it seems like a very good deal .
so now , different person@@ s , older , ta@@ p .
for@@ ty-@@ seven percent of the time , people are thinking about something other than what they &apos;re currently doing .
and every single day these tun@@ a , blu@@ ef@@ in like this , are stac@@ ked up like cor@@ d@@ wood , just war@@ eh@@ ou@@ se after war@@ eh@@ ou@@ se .
we don &apos;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here .
and i said to her , &quot; well , your year is going to be long and ar@@ du@@ ous , de@@ ar . &quot;
so we had one group that i hop@@ ed their performance would be very high , another group that i thought their performance would be very low , and when i got the results , that &apos;s what we got -- i was very happy -- a@@ side from one person .
and if we sli@@ p from the real@@ m of the sea into the real@@ m of the spirit of the imagination , you enter the real@@ m of ti@@ bet@@ an buddhi@@ sm .
and out of that came the instru@@ ments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology .

even though his people are being geno@@ ci@@ ded -- and believe me , he feels every b@@ low on every old nun &apos;s head , in every chinese prison . he feels it .
we built the bright new re@@ ception hall that made people , ti@@ ran@@ a citizens , think they had travel@@ ed ab@@ road when they ent@@ ered to make their re@@ qu@@ ests .
that would be really our only choice .
and out of my own fru@@ stration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these gui@@ del@@ ines and these structures that are defin@@ ing this man box , i would find myself saying things like , &quot; just go in your room .
from las@@ cau@@ x to the lou@@ v@@ re to car@@ ne@@ gie hall , human beings have a per@@ man@@ ent in@@ na@@ te ta@@ ste for virtu@@ o@@ so disp@@ la@@ ys in the arts .

it comes in a fi@@ ve-@@ o@@ un@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a bre@@ aded with di@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ iled bre@@ ad@@ cru@@ m@@ bs and a ste@@ aming pi@@ le of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pi@@ la@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , grill@@ ed bro@@ c@@ coli so soft and sweet and char@@ red and smo@@ ky on the outside with just a hin@@ t of chil@@ i fla@@ ke .
you see , the streets are clear .
in the great teaching of his hol@@ iness the d@@ al@@ a@@ i lam@@ a that he always tea@@ ches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kind@@ ness .
this only started about 150 years ago .
and in fact , we are very interested in those first two years of life , because those li@@ abilities don &apos;t necessarily conver@@ t into au@@ ti@@ sm .
now , they are not born that way . right ?
how interesting .
so here &apos;s two questions for you .
one , two , three . go !
but what happened was that he had to be on medi@@ cation that , at that time -- di@@ flu@@ can , which in the states is used for ye@@ ast infe@@ ctions -- cost 30 dollars a p@@ ill .
just as we created it .
joseph : i was born in 198@@ 6 .
for one thing , he &apos;s almost seven feet t@@ all .
this is the integration of worl@@ d@@ wide telescope into our ma@@ ps .
em : zero . pay zero up front .
you see that really sal@@ ty pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h ?
the effect of el si@@ ste@@ ma is felt in three fundamental cir@@ cles : in the personal / social circle , in the family circle and in the community .
i think that they are , that the stat@@ ements that we make in this public se@@ ctor are our contribu@@ tions to a larger whole .
second one : can you light a little tor@@ ch@@ -@@ bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire ?
i appli@@ ed to read anthropolo@@ gy at university .
there are 800 different languages in the hi@@ g@@ hl@@ and@@ s .
the counter@@ -@@ movement says , &quot; let &apos;s go back to this .
you can &apos;t understand two people talking at once or in this case one person talking twice .
so i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well , and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the web is going right now .
are you in anyway related to the du@@ tch government ? &quot;
it &apos;s so un@@ interesting .
daniel kraft : a better way to harv@@ est b@@ one mar@@ row
and this one was a big lesson because i was praying , giving these pra@@ yers of than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , which was odd for an agno@@ stic .
the reason this is happening bo@@ ils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our in@@ ability to per@@ cei@@ ve the difference between public benefits and private profi@@ ts .
but what is really amazing , because of this deep@@ ness here , em@@ per@@ or penguins can go down more than 500 me@@ ters and they can hold their bre@@ ath for 23 minutes .
i have been there for a long time .
for instance , this is a beautiful con@@ tain@@ er for asth@@ ma medicine that kind of in@@ fl@@ ates itself when it &apos;s time for you to take the medicine , so the child has to go -- p@@ ff@@ ff ! -- to rele@@ ase and re@@ lie@@ ve the con@@ tain@@ er itself .
para@@ orchestra is the name of that project .
so , when some very political , exciting moments happened , you can see on wei@@ bo , you see a lot of very weird stories happened .
and when you do that , the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit .
i &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mor@@ n@@ ings .
i was at a conc@@ ert that he was atten@@ ding to mark his birthday and for the cre@@ ation of new resources for his foundation .
there is a chemical that &apos;s called per@@ flu@@ br@@ on .
first , keith bar@@ ry shows us how our brains can fo@@ ol our bodies -- in a trick that works via po@@ d@@ cast too . then he invol@@ ves the audience in some ja@@ w-@@ dropping fe@@ ats of brain magic .
if i get in front of ro@@ mo here .
i fell into this apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic dream world .
&quot; have you taken if for a month ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
in 199@@ 5 , we started working on a two-@@ year investi@@ ga@@ tive research project to try and find out what was going on .
and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
and the strange thing is , when i watch the film -- i have the e@@ erie sen@@ sation of seeing it -- i saw myself literally disappear .
and here is another five seconds of re@@ pose , is my man@@ tra . form and function .
how do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you &apos;re developing ?
keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
had he shown his father , &quot; my boy has finally lost it , &quot; he would &apos;ve thought .
i work with really amazing , little , i@@ tt@@ y-@@ bi@@ t@@ ty creatures called cells .
it &apos;s important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s .
how are we going to hand@@ le in@@ surance ?
but think about it .
we started with a super@@ star mon@@ key called au@@ r@@ or@@ a that became one of the super@@ stars of this field .
now , some of us natur@@ ally read our fe@@ ars more closely than others .
as soon as i realized this , i investi@@ g@@ ated the underlying relationship between four pre@@ valent air pollu@@ tants and their affect on the lung health of asth@@ matic patients .
other lab@@ s have actually looked at this as well using different meas@@ ures of dis@@ gu@@ st sensi@@ tivity , so rather than asking people how easily dis@@ gu@@ sted they are , they ho@@ ok people up to physi@@ ological meas@@ ures , in this case skin condu@@ ct@@ ance .
the cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
s@@ k : absolutely . and this is something that i re@@ com@@ mend everyone in this audience to do .
it &apos;s being managed by a sing@@ apo@@ re@@ an-@@ based management company .
in the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ shes , dra@@ wing cir@@ cles beyond cir@@ cles .
this is the view from the inside .
and he said , &quot; well , okay . &quot;
this is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
i wrote an article enti@@ tled &quot; lin@@ ked data &quot; a couple of years ago and soon after that , things started to happen .
so obviously , we can do better , and we want to do better , and we &apos;re all trying to be green .
and o@@ dy@@ sse@@ us does his best job pla@@ y@@ acting and says , &quot; unti@@ e me . unti@@ e me .
it &apos;s also working in live animal markets -- these we@@ t markets -- which is exactly the place where s@@ ars emer@@ ged in asia .
and finally , i said , i wonder if there &apos;s any relationship between how much people change and how it in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted their tumor growth , whi@@ che@@ ver group they happened to be in .
thank you very much .
so they kept on going .
and life is really , too .
now , what &apos;s interesting , i should say this as a disc@@ la@@ im@@ er , there is medical literature that is very difficult to resol@@ ve with this other data , which suggests that car seats are dramatically better .
but at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .
but it also acts like a kind of rela@@ y station that re-@@ radi@@ ates and re@@ dire@@ cts information to many other parts of the brain .
there are still many questions to be answered and asked about roman@@ tic love .
oh , i mis@@ sed one : or e ) none of the above ?
ge@@ ver tu@@ l@@ ley : a roll@@ er@@ co@@ a@@ ster built by se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
and after that , most likely it &apos;s going to begin to decline .
this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution .
on the isra@@ el@@ i side , there is a new peace movement called soli@@ dar@@ i@@ ot , which means soli@@ dar@@ ity in he@@ bre@@ w .
and you have to re@@ visit these questions over time .
that is , they can dis@@ connect fra@@ ct@@ ally and then re@@ connect se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
and the universe is now a comp@@ il@@ er .
and today , bread now is associated with o@@ be@@ sity , which is very strange .
not everyone . there were actually a few bra@@ ve eg@@ ypti@@ ans that i have to thank for being so bra@@ ve -- going into prote@@ sts as a couple of hundred , getting be@@ aten up and ar@@ rested .
but i -- i also appreci@@ ate the diversity that you have here .
thank you . anyway , we would fill up with our own ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and our own cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and then we &apos;d kill or be killed , we &apos;d eat or we &apos;d be e@@ aten , and then suddenly we &apos;d de-@@ fuel , and we &apos;d go back to normal . okay .
we &apos;re working on our college es@@ says . send them in . &quot;
the other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of brazi@@ li@@ ans on twitter .
does science ru@@ in the magic of life ? in this gru@@ mp@@ y but char@@ ming mon@@ olo@@ gue , ro@@ bin in@@ ce makes the argument against . the more we learn about the ast@@ oni@@ shing behavior of the universe -- the more we stand in a@@ we .
and so god put both of these possibilities into the world .
so now , in clo@@ sing , people say , now why laptops ?
she is gra@@ ce@@ ful , she is mysteri@@ ous and she is tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent , and those are the central quali@@ ties of glamour .
that &apos;s why we grow homes . thanks very much .
what you did in the early marri@@ age days , you tried to im@@ press your wife . i did the same .
he even taught me the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an the@@ or@@ em .
he would have fallen to his death , being 75 feet above the ground .
there &apos;s 7@@ 0,000 sam@@ ples of different vari@@ eties of ri@@ ce in this faci@@ lity right now .
and your neurons are not going to be ori@@ ented and posi@@ tioned in exactly the same way .
you go to the stere@@ o store , you see two sets of speak@@ ers -- these big , bo@@ xy , mon@@ oli@@ ths , and these little , sle@@ ek speak@@ ers , and you play them , and you go , you know , i do hear a difference : the big ones sound a little better .

m@@ ck@@ im found this every time he did it with his students .
i m@@ ing@@ led with almost everyone .
they &apos;re all common ones : chinese j@@ as@@ mine , japanese sen@@ cha , ear@@ l gre@@ y and a special bl@@ end that we prepar@@ ed .
she questions him , &quot; what kind of a person are you going to be ? &quot;
we were victims of the sp@@ ani@@ ards .
and you know , it had this fra@@ gr@@ ant soft@@ ness , and it sm@@ elled a little bit of lin@@ seed oil .
now there &apos;s a theory called super@@ -@@ symme@@ try , which dou@@ b@@ les the number of particles in the standard model , which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simpli@@ fi@@ cation .
now it is not surprising that with this mas@@ si@@ fi@@ cation and lar@@ ge-@@ scale production , there is a counter@@ -@@ movement that emer@@ ged -- very much also here in california .
and i started playing with it more like a puzzle .
i was the most popular person online .
they &apos;re called the gran@@ ny cloud .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emer@@ ged .
ne@@ tra and i met when she was 18 .
this kind of dia@@ gram is called a bal@@ lo@@ on race .
now i &apos;m not in the least bit religious , neither was my father , but at that point , i noticed something happening here .
so how do the children do science ?
group by bro@@ c@@ coli , group by your favorite vege@@ table , something you can as@@ pire to .
there &apos;s the mo@@ unt ka@@ il@@ ash in eastern ti@@ bet -- wonderful setting .
and the most complex things are ourselves , mid@@ way between at@@ oms and stars .
if they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well .
there was no cure , and there was no vac@@ cine .
the reason is , they &apos;re treating other people like a computer , and the brain is too .
then you load the aircraft , and then you stand up and you get on , and you kind of lu@@ mber to the aircraft like this , in a line of people , and you sit down on can@@ v@@ as seats on either side of the aircraft .
now let me ask you a simple question : what is the area of the re@@ ct@@ angle ?
and for those of you who love the arts , aren &apos;t you gla@@ d you invi@@ ted me here to bri@@ gh@@ ten your day ?
but the ne@@ at thing about it is i can add control points .
this has paid all the costs for the transformation of interface .
we love cr@@ un@@ chin@@ ess , mou@@ th@@ feel .
we can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering , one of the things you can do with your ta@@ ke@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ home , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself genetic engineering k@@ it -- -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite , a place like europa , so we could coloni@@ ze europa with our own creatures .
but in that inst@@ ant , i get to share your present .
we found that we have , on average , 8@@ 6 billion neurons , 16 billion of which are in the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex , and if you consider that the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex is the se@@ at of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reas@@ oning , and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has , i think this is the sim@@ pl@@ est explan@@ ation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
but at d@@ us@@ k everything changes .
i &apos;m powerful .
ei@@ gh@@ ty-@@ two dollars a night .
and i failed miser@@ ably .
and the question of course is , what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos ?
after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the s@@ ali@@ ent issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because , after all , that &apos;s really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work , where we intervie@@ wed adult experts in academi@@ a , some of the people who &apos;d produced the literature that we found relevant .
i studied yoga for many years with a teacher named swa@@ mi sat@@ chi@@ dan@@ anda and people would say , &quot; what are you , a hin@@ du ? &quot; he &apos;d say , &quot; no , i &apos;m an un@@ do . &quot;
we can make it better .
it &apos;s been reported that wiki@@ lea@@ ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classi@@ fied docum@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s media comb@@ ined .
this is je@@ an v@@ ani@@ er .
watch how often the be@@ et@@ le dan@@ ces .
he said , &quot; everything i &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . it was wrong .
one for animals , including domestic animals -- and i have to say , i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got to g@@ om@@ be and the ch@@ im@@ ps from my dog , ru@@ sty , who was my chil@@ d@@ hood compani@@ on .
it needs to worked on until it can speak flu@@ ently .
i had this book that was how to draw com@@ i@@ cs in the mar@@ vel way , and it taught me how to draw super@@ hero@@ es , how to draw a woman , how to draw mu@@ sc@@ les just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x-@@ men or spi@@ der@@ man .
and when i present this in africa -- nai@@ rob@@ i , la@@ gos , ac@@ cr@@ a -- i get one question .
mal@@ um@@ a is on top . yeah . so .
sar@@ ah brown w@@ ess@@ ling : good morning everybody .
and at that minute , you felt at one with the universe -- one with that ju@@ g of water , one with every human being , one with the cre@@ ator -- and you felt you were in the pres@@ ence of power , of a@@ we , of the deep@@ est love , the deep@@ est sense of compassion and mer@@ cy that you have ever experienced in your lives .
j@@ h : well , i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elem@@ ental force gets reve@@ al@@ ed , and that &apos;s the beauty here .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
now what does ri@@ c@@ car@@ do mu@@ t@@ i do ? he does something like this ...
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . pri@@ or to seeing this , we would have as@@ sum@@ ed : a 10@@ -@@ foot po@@ le couldn &apos;t fit in your pocket ; something as in@@ expensive as ink couldn &apos;t sense the way paper is being b@@ ent ; every one of these things -- and we &apos;re constantly trying to find more .
i learned this from a woman who survived au@@ schwi@@ tz , one of the r@@ are survi@@ vor@@ s .
all this really surpri@@ sed me , because i started to realize that my un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted experienced was so far more multi@@ -@@ sen@@ sor@@ y than my si@@ gh@@ ted experience ever was .
and to start those studies about 40 years ago , i began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists , and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expect either f@@ ame or fortun@@ e , but which made their life mean@@ ing@@ ful and worth doing .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; well , if you got me a je@@ ep i could get around a lot faster . &quot;
these are just like the re@@ cept@@ ors on the surfaces of your cells .
we &apos;ve never seen anything even re@@ mot@@ ely like this before . &quot;
beat@@ ja@@ zz is : 1 . live lo@@ oping , 2 . ja@@ zz improvi@@ sation and 3 . &quot; ge@@ stu@@ ral &quot; sound design .
there &apos;s water in between the skul@@ l and the trans@@ du@@ cer .
but it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
don &apos;t worry .
but of course the price of mass production has been that we moved lar@@ ge-@@ scale .
and this guy comes up to me , and he &apos;s got tat@@ to@@ os and his pon@@ y@@ tail and his bas@@ e@@ ball cap on , and he had his two daugh@@ ters with him , and he said , &quot; go@@ v , these are my two daugh@@ ters . &quot;
and this farm was 1@@ 20,000 ac@@ res .
and so he gave me the time to code it up .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would o@@ ther@@ wise grow distant from , if we weren &apos;t playing games together .
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bil@@ ingu@@ al enough to help us translate .
somebody said , &quot; you have to listen to this . &quot;
it &apos;s hot@@ ter in summer than in winter because the ra@@ ys from the sun are spread out more , right , because of the ti@@ lt of the earth .
one way of descri@@ bing the pl@@ u@@ to@@ c@@ rats is as al@@ ph@@ a ge@@ e@@ ks , and they are people who are acu@@ tely aware of how important highly sophi@@ sti@@ cated analy@@ tical and qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive skills are in today &apos;s economy .
the care@@ ful te@@ sting , re@@ te@@ sting , design , are going to open up vi@@ st@@ as of understanding , complexi@@ ties , difficult things .
and a lot of these dep@@ loy@@ ments that we &apos;re actually sending military person@@ nel to these days aren &apos;t traditional wars .
now ed@@ ward de bon@@ o argu@@ ed that our brains are pattern mat@@ ching machines .
and as i was model@@ ing this man@@ gro@@ ve swa@@ mp , i was thinking to myself , &quot; how do you put a box around this ? &quot;
and i was -- i usually travel alone when i do my work , but i did this -- i ho@@ sted a program for discovery , and when i went down with the team , i was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people , especially into the hu@@ aor@@ an@@ i , deep into the hu@@ aor@@ an@@ i tribe .
and another piece for the art dire@@ ctors &apos; club is &quot; an@@ na re@@ es &quot; casting long sha@@ do@@ ws .
bar@@ ry schwar@@ tz : using our practi@@ cal wisdom
and i don &apos;t speak kore@@ an , but i &apos;m hearing these voices , and i &apos;m not hearing an@@ ger , i &apos;m hearing ter@@ ror .
ordinary people live life against the law , and that &apos;s what i -- we are doing to our kids .
suddenly , degrees aren &apos;t worth anything . isn &apos;t that true ?
i thought about , what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity ?
they started compe@@ ting .
smi@@ ling can help reduce the level of stres@@ s-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and dop@@ am@@ ine , increase the level of mo@@ o@@ d-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like end@@ orph@@ in and reduce overall blood pressure .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it &apos;s a fre@@ ely li@@ cen@@ sed en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia . it &apos;s written by thousands of volun@@ te@@ ers all over the world in many , many languages .
her designers &apos; attention to detail and her construction gives heli@@ os &apos; structure the flexi@@ bi@@ lity and strength to deal with the turbul@@ ence en@@ counter@@ ed in the atmosphere .
i figured there would be a minim@@ um of 7@@ 00 points before i would agree to e@@ mail somebody or respond to an e@@ mail message .
so , another random thing i do is the search for ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al intelligence , or seti .
my dad was always whi@@ st@@ ling around the house , and i just thought that &apos;s part of communication in my family .
as long as we &apos;re teaching our kids that hero@@ ism starts when someone sc@@ rat@@ ches a mark on your fore@@ head , or someone tells you that you &apos;re part of a prop@@ he@@ cy , they &apos;re missing the most important charac@@ teri@@ stic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
as a scientist , i always wanted to measure that reson@@ ance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blin@@ k of an eye .
&quot; no need for birth control , do@@ c , are you sure about that ? &quot;
and the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gging to get roots .
he went to new york ; he went to chi@@ ca@@ go ; he went to jack@@ son@@ ville ; he went to los angeles . and he brought in people by the tru@@ ck@@ load . into big hall@@ s .
this is the nature . it cannot be tain@@ ted in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally with hat@@ red or je@@ al@@ ous@@ y because , then , if it was always there -- like a dy@@ e that would per@@ me@@ ate the whole cl@@ oth -- then it would be found all the time , somewhere .
it &apos;s a terrible design strate@@ gy actually .
of course , i &apos;m not ad@@ vo@@ cating that we all give up agriculture and me@@ tal tools and return to a h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er lifestyle .
so the inter@@ planet@@ ary system is on its way , but there &apos;s a last project , which the de@@ fen@@ se advanced research projects agency , which funded the original ar@@ pan@@ et , funded the internet , funded the inter@@ planet@@ ary architecture , is now funding a project to design a spac@@ e@@ craft to get to the ne@@ ar@@ est star in 100 years &apos; time .
here &apos;s the impli@@ cation of what happens .
the fact that we forget most of our chil@@ d@@ hood , for example , is probably fine , because it doesn &apos;t effect our mov@@ ements later in life .
in this country and in bri@@ tain , magne@@ ti@@ sm is understood better by children before they &apos;ve been to school than afterwards , ok ?
there are academic journ@@ als like &quot; trials , &quot; the open access journ@@ al , which will publi@@ sh any trial condu@@ cted in humans re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a positive or a negative result .
and there is a way the world both en@@ visions food , the way the world wri@@ tes about food and lear@@ ns about food .
but you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria , and you &apos;re considered a para@@ site yourself .
they &apos;re sp@@ litt@@ ing the cost of inst@@ all@@ ing these green ro@@ o@@ fs with home and building o@@ wn@@ ers .
we have one for the non@@ profit se@@ ctor and one for the rest of the economic world .
fe@@ tal ori@@ g@@ ins research is not about bl@@ aming women for what happens during pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy .
yeah . the middle east is going cra@@ zy .
and you can think about those as hei@@ ght , wid@@ th and dep@@ th .
so here , in wo@@ ol , through a domestic femin@@ ine art , is the pro@@ of that the most famous po@@ stu@@ late in mathematics is wrong .
is it music ? here &apos;s how i want to conclu@@ de .
and , lea@@ h ad@@ ds with a gr@@ in , &quot; ka@@ vi@@ ta , we especially are proud of our christmas music , because it shows we are open to religious practi@@ ces even though ca@@ tholic church hat@@ es us l@@ g@@ bt . &quot;
it all started back in 200@@ 1 .
w@@ k : i think it will produce more than 20 the watts .
where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the o@@ ec@@ d ?
and i wor@@ e it wh@@ en@@ ever i could , thinking it was the most fab@@ ul@@ ous thing i ow@@ ned .
and then you get an f@@ mri speci@@ alist , and you get frank wil@@ son , and you get other kinds of hard scientists , including neuro@@ en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologists .
but what was even more important was the fact that they actually ac@@ compli@@ shed their mission . the japanese government called off their wh@@ aling expedi@@ tion . mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history , as a matter of fact .
this is the same way we &apos;ve been producing electricity , the ste@@ am turb@@ ine idea , for 100 years , and nuclear was a really big advan@@ c@@ ement in a way to heat the water , but you still bo@@ il water and that turns to ste@@ am and turns the turb@@ ine .
and you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead -- or because i need to sti@@ r them up in some way for you to see what biolumin@@ escence really looks like .
i am now ex@@ pos@@ ing myself to my audience , right ?
it &apos;s the most bizar@@ re way to actually trans@@ port your food in any particular direction , and at the same time it &apos;s got to deal with the heat .
i am used to no choice . &quot;
and here &apos;s one of the things that i@@ da t@@ arb@@ ell said -- she said , &quot; he has a thin no@@ se like a th@@ or@@ n .
and i &apos;ll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary preci@@ sion .
bf : no , shu@@ t up !
the provi@@ sions in the agre@@ ement may be complex , but so is the underlying conflict .
i am writing as well as ever .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
i &apos;m going to get there before you .
so that inspired me to think about , well , what if i try to use this idea in order , not to detect random tex@@ ts from tex@@ ts with meaning , but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biom@@ o@@ le@@ cules that make up life .
and it was a funny kind of si@@ ck feeling , but i turned him down .
a play bal@@ let .
i just signed .
and the good news is i don &apos;t have a prepar@@ ed speech , but i have a box of sli@@ des .
it wasn &apos;t just compassion for europe , though there was that .
where would that leave us ?
the public real@@ m in america has two ro@@ les : it is the d@@ w@@ elling place of our civilization and our civi@@ c life , and it is the physical manifest@@ ation of the common good .
if the connection is strong , the mot@@ ors will turn on and the fly will initi@@ ate a turn .
okay , that &apos;s sever@@ in ha@@ cker .
and that young boy believed our promi@@ ses that we would help people in difficul@@ ty in r@@ wand@@ a , and we never did .
in a pe@@ tr@@ i dish , bac@@ teria grow . say they double every generation , and five gener@@ ations before the end the pe@@ tr@@ i dish is 15 / 1@@ 6@@ ths empty , and then the next generation &apos;s 3 / 4@@ ths empty , and the next generation half empty . within one generation after the pe@@ tr@@ i dish still being half empty , it is full . there &apos;s no more food and the bac@@ teria have collap@@ sed .
you know , as chris men@@ tioned , i wrote a book called &quot; the wisdom of crow@@ ds . &quot;
and my people now can use their skills to ear@@ n money themselves .
car@@ men agr@@ a de@@ e@@ dy : all right , then you know that you have now ent@@ ered parking lot pur@@ g@@ at@@ ory , praying to that sa@@ int of per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al avail@@ ability that as you join that ser@@ p@@ ent@@ ine line of cars cra@@ w@@ ling along , some guy &apos;s going to turn on the bra@@ ke lights just as you pull up behind him .
it &apos;s more difficult .
30 or so scientists around the world gather@@ ed and asked a question for the first time , &quot; do we have to put the planet into the the pot ? &quot;
we are still left with a god who can do the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i and allow au@@ schwi@@ tz .
and i think she over@@ did it .
and so by doing that , the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she &apos;s a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she &apos;s going to be able to do it because of these things .
by now , the united nations is totally on our side .
but it &apos;s a story until we conver@@ t it to data and so what we do , this concept we had , was to take steven &apos;s status , &quot; what is my status ? &quot;
let &apos;s do one in l.a. &quot;
don &apos;t feel as@@ ham@@ ed .
so , we began through our non@@ profit institute &apos;s training hospi@@ t@@ als around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery , and not only was it medi@@ cally effective , it was also cost effective .
the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it .
the same for the modern se@@ mi@@ -@@ condu@@ ctor industry .
now , the term &quot; information society , &quot; &quot; information economy , &quot; for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution . but in fact , for pur@@ pos@@ es of understanding what &apos;s happening today , that &apos;s wrong . because for 150 years , we &apos;ve had an information economy .
me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u.@@ n@@ . security coun@@ cil .
so , na@@ om@@ i was pi@@ vot@@ al in that .
and the last one is a richard fe@@ y@@ n@@ man quote : &quot; what i cannot build , i cannot understand . &quot;
i re@@ call how they were seri@@ ously bo@@ iling the con@@ co@@ ction .
and we &apos;re seeing from all points on the globe similar stories .
when the wind pas@@ ses , ri@@ ses to pass over the mountain , it can take on a wa@@ ve-@@ like path in the lee of the peak , with these clouds ho@@ ver@@ ing at the c@@ rest of these invi@@ sible standing waves of air , these flying sau@@ cer@@ -like forms , and some of the early bl@@ ack@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white u@@ f@@ o photos are in fact l@@ enti@@ cul@@ ar@@ is clouds . it &apos;s true .

you can di@@ al up the inten@@ sity or di@@ al down the inten@@ sity of an emotion .
it &apos;s &quot; ari@@ a &quot; of john ca@@ ge .

it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any pu@@ ppe@@ t for us on@@ stage .
and then i went in and i got a global con@@ sul@@ ting job with ac@@ cent@@ ure .
and the auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal self has pro@@ mp@@ ted exten@@ ded memory , reas@@ oning , imagination , creativity and language .
i want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after i &apos;ll speak .
no to stri@@ pping the people , and the blue br@@ a is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a vei@@ led woman to be stri@@ pped and be@@ aten on the street , and the footprint re@@ ads , &quot; long live a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful revolution , &quot; because we will never re@@ tali@@ ate with violence .
here &apos;s another one .
it &apos;s not this , right ? it &apos;s not a child &apos;s to@@ y .
it &apos;s a two-@@ la@@ yer suit . nasa su@@ its have got 13 la@@ yers .
i was doing my ta@@ xes the other day , and i got to the point where i was li@@ sting all of the don@@ ations i gave , and i had an epi@@ ph@@ any , it was -- i came to my check to the se@@ v@@ a foundation and i noticed that i thought , boy , my friend lar@@ ry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to se@@ v@@ a .
i &apos;m often asked , what surpri@@ ses you about the book ?
so instead of having star@@ ch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and bur@@ ns it at such a rate that it &apos;s burning fat , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , about the rate of a small cat .
as it turns out , all the great and inspi@@ ring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it &apos;s apple or martin luther king or the w@@ right brothers -- they all think , act and communicate the ex@@ act same way .
go@@ li@@ ath is not what he seems to be .
he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted , and immediately , he sc@@ ored 8@@ 50 points .
there &apos;s lots of hor@@ mon@@ es . there &apos;s te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in .
there &apos;s 10,000 neurons here .
and on the right we learn that there &apos;s a new way to support your breast .
some people think that religion is an adap@@ tation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to co@@ here , in part for the purpose of tru@@ sting each other , and then being more effective at compe@@ ting with other groups .
when what was a tran@@ qui@@ l sea s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws up people , homes and long-@@ tail bo@@ ats -- mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess@@ ly , without war@@ ning -- and no one can tell you anything reli@@ able about whether another one is coming , i &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want to cal@@ m down either .
we also , because we rate them on all these vari@@ ables related to compe@@ t@@ ence , like , how well-@@ stru@@ ctu@@ red is the speech ? how good is it ? what are their quali@@ fi@@ cations ?
what can creatures like us know of such things ?
and it really im@@ pres@@ sed me -- i met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience , and ended up with the de@@ mean@@ or that he had .
so if we go and look at this piece of content , president obama &apos;s state of the union address from just a few weeks ago , and look at what we find in this same data set , at the same scale , the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable .
and they mix up in all different fashi@@ ons , and that makes you a human being .
&quot; if it &apos;s the ra@@ i@@ sin , they won &apos;t drop it . &quot;
i said , &quot; who@@ a , science is so wonderful , i have to become a scientist . &quot;
something else you see that you talk about -- americans don &apos;t talk about this , but you do .
and i ear@@ ned enough money to pay for my first year of cal@@ tech .
and the next morning , she knew if she could get to a ne@@ ar@@ by village where there was a foreign mis@@ sion@@ ary , she would be saved .
the first day , they were even sh@@ ou@@ ting at each other .
sounds like a conser@@ va@@ tive climate plan . &quot;
so here , and at a time when we &apos;ve gone from the au@@ d@@ acity to hope to hope for some au@@ d@@ acity , i ur@@ ge you to do something .
words like e@@ quality and fairness and the traditional elections , democracy , these are not really great terms yet .
and with new technology , we &apos;re redu@@ cing -- and i believe , someday we &apos;ll elimin@@ ate -- co2 emissions .
and the ju@@ dge found us -- rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly found us not gu@@ il@@ ty , so ...
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
bab@@ bage &apos;s difference engine was the first mechanical calcul@@ ator devi@@ sed to ac@@ cur@@ ately compu@@ te any of these tables .
there are more neuro@@ mod@@ ul@@ ators that alter , that inner@@ v@@ ate this structure than actually neurons in the structure , and they &apos;re able to generate a complicated set of patterns .
and to connect our country after world war i@@ i , we didn &apos;t build more two-@@ lan@@ e high@@ ways , we built the inter@@ state high@@ way system .
let us support these people .
that has@@ n &apos;t changed in over 150 years .
culture is a reaction to nature , and this understanding of our ancestors is trans@@ mitted generation from generation in the form of stories , symb@@ ols and ritu@@ als , which are always in@@ different to ration@@ ality .
we were not predi@@ cting it .
and this summer , we &apos;re going to build five million of these $ 100 laptops , and maybe 50 million next year .
it &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
as a little boy , and through my teen@@ age years , i became increasingly fascin@@ ated by the diversity of life .
for the men in these photographs , the pri@@ mary cause of their wr@@ on@@ g@@ ful con@@ vi@@ ction was mi@@ sta@@ ken identifi@@ cation .
per@@ fl@@ ou@@ ro@@ o@@ ct@@ ano@@ ic ac@@ id .
audience : a@@ y@@ e .
that should be the goal .
and they didn &apos;t achieve power@@ ed man flight , and the w@@ right brothers beat them to it .
and the solution we ended up using is pe@@ er gra@@ ding .
and it fo@@ sters innovation at the state level in these laborat@@ ories of democracy .
there &apos;s a similar story for my electricity consumption , where swi@@ t@@ ching off the d@@ v@@ d players , the stere@@ os , the computer peri@@ pher@@ als that were on all the time , and just swi@@ t@@ ching them on when i needed them , kno@@ cked another third off my electricity bills too .
it was in places like this . this a school set up by some n@@ uns in another slum called na@@ kur@@ u .
he see@@ ked for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , and he cla@@ im@@ s to en@@ dea@@ vor to improve the lives of his chil@@ d-@@ soldiers .
so i &apos;m trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this mel@@ o@@ dy .
you pu@@ mp it at a high pressure through a no@@ zz@@ le .
now , what this means is that if i run this piece of software , the camera sees the in@@ fr@@ ared do@@ t , and i can regi@@ ster the lo@@ cation of the camera pi@@ x@@ els to the proje@@ ctor pi@@ x@@ els . and now this is like a whi@@ te@@ board surface .
thir@@ ty-@@ six years ago at nearly this moment , a 19@@ -@@ year-old boy a@@ wo@@ ke from a com@@ a to ask a nurse a question , but the nurse was already there with an answer .
hu@@ h , amazing .
i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time .
we have another possibility we are working &#91; on &#93; in our lab , &#91; which &#93; is to build hy@@ bri@@ ds .
they actually did so through a cent@@ r@@ alized head@@ quar@@ ters out of il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , right ?
well , the second part of that , soon after -- and i was talking to paul allen ; i saw him in the audience , and i hand@@ ed him a cop@@ y of &quot; r@@ are earth . &quot;
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boo@@ sts in mo@@ od and long-@@ term increases in happiness .
i mean , i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes i want , the sk@@ ir@@ ts i want -- and i &apos;m hoping to try to bring these over here and make them acc@@ es@@ sible to a lot of people .
so this is a graph of pre@@ val@@ ence est@@ im@@ ated by un@@ aids , and pre@@ val@@ ence based on the mortality data for the years in the late 199@@ 0s in nine countries in africa .
show me the evidence . &quot;
this is to show you that this meth@@ od works .
so through the marath@@ on , we learned that political problems can be over@@ come .
that &apos;s older than my dad .
that if we invol@@ ve them in their education , if we have them disc@@ uss the real issues that they con@@ front -- that our whole society con@@ fron@@ ts -- and if we give them skills that en@@ able them to engage the real world , that magic will happen .
if you can hear music , you should be able to hear anything .
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see i &apos;ve got an oxygen m@@ ask on with a re@@ brea@@ ther .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : indepen@@ dence , self-@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ency , auton@@ omy .
if we do that , we not only get the jobs , we get the improv@@ ements in public infrastructure , the re@@ stor@@ ation of public infrastructure .
secon@@ dly , we put it for infrastructure . food .
she did this on the &quot; lar@@ ry king live &quot; show on c@@ n@@ n six and a half years ago .
if you look at the o@@ ec@@ d countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person , and comp@@ are it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries , the ra@@ ti@@ o — bran@@ ko mi@@ lan@@ o@@ vi@@ c at the world bank did the calcu@@ lations — turns out to be about 3@@ 0,000 to one .
she just answered , &quot; they are contribu@@ ting to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community . &quot;
we needed new boun@@ dar@@ ies to describe our traditional lands ; we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether -- can gps really refle@@ ct the true refle@@ ction of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the west ?
but , you know , nasa scre@@ wed that up because they &apos;ve sent these robots and they &apos;ve land@@ ed it only in the deser@@ ts .
like economi@@ sts , you know , their definition of ra@@ tional , that we all act out of our own economic self-@@ interest .
course , like light , it &apos;s great to be able to put sound to high@@ light a clothing ra@@ ck , or the cor@@ n@@ fla@@ kes , or the to@@ oth@@ pa@@ ste , or a talking pla@@ que in a movie theater lob@@ by .
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be us@@ er-@@ cent@@ ri@@ c .
he lived , and still does , in rural ver@@ mon@@ t .
i was sitting in a slum outside gur@@ ga@@ on just next to delhi , one of the fl@@ as@@ hi@@ est , bri@@ gh@@ test new cities po@@ pping up in india right now , and i was talking to workers who worked in gar@@ ment swe@@ at@@ sh@@ ops down the road , and i asked them what message they would like me to take to the brand@@ s .
you can get shot by the har@@ d-@@ head@@ ed athei@@ sts , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be .
so this didn &apos;t requi@@ re any inven@@ tion .
well , a human , one of your legs works like two legs of a tro@@ tting dog , or works like three legs , together as one , of a tro@@ tting insect , or four legs as one of a tro@@ tting cra@@ b .
first of all , i &apos;ve been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such &quot; for dum@@ mies . &quot;
she was ear@@ ning 4@@ 50 dollars . she was doing okay .
so t@@ abo@@ o number four : you can &apos;t say that your average happiness has de@@ clin@@ ed since having a child .
it &apos;ll be millions of times more powerful than it is today .
they want to say , &quot; there i was , i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head . &quot;
pri@@ son@@ ers are still born into pri@@ son@@ er-@@ o@@ f-@@ war cam@@ ps long after the gu@@ ards are gone .
okay , maybe it &apos;s a bit of a c@@ lich@@ é to talk about them .
it is unbelie@@ v@@ ably bad .
actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years &apos; time .
but , little did i know , until i jump@@ ed for the first time in a mar@@ ine reser@@ ve .
now , so i know the frequ@@ ency .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five billion .
david by@@ r@@ ne : how architecture helped music evolve
i work 10 hours a day ; i com@@ mu@@ te two hours a day .
we just had a workshop in gu@@ atem@@ ala .
and now , i &apos;ll count to three . i mean , it still looks very or@@ der@@ ly to me .
you know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connect@@ ome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .
same thing goes true for -- that &apos;s the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20@@ th@@ -@@ century popular music , whether it &apos;s rock or la@@ tin music or whatever .
so my core team and i are able to con@@ cent@@ rate on the improv@@ ements that really benefit everyone .
they wei@@ gh thousands of pounds , are not by any means agi@@ le .
engineer ra mas@@ hel@@ k@@ ar shares three stories of ultra@@ -@@ low-@@ cost design from india that use bot@@ tom@@ -up re@@ thinking , and some clever engineering , to bring expensive products into the real@@ m of the possible for everyone .
i know because i &apos;ve been shot down so many times i get altitude si@@ ck@@ ness just from standing up for myself .
we have an at@@ titude that support groups are inher@@ ently benefi@@ cial .
and i want to do it for the girls that s@@ uni@@ th@@ a talked about yesterday , the girls who survive , the girls who can become somebody else .
by the way , two days ago , we were going to film this down there , at the race course , and we got a guy into a car , and we got a camera man in the back , but hal@@ f@@ way through the drive , he told me he had a -- i think it was a nin@@ e-@@ milli@@ meter or something , stuck to his leg .
and to give you some example , i remember standing and looking down a road as far as i could see , at least a mile , and there were bodies pil@@ ed twice my hei@@ ght of the dead .
and the context i &apos;m talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars .
and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with ro@@ cks and with a lot of complex chemistry to ori@@ gin@@ ate , to emer@@ ge , to survive .
you could stick it on the front of a t-@@ shirt , which is always the sign of elegan@@ ce .
and we &apos;ll do that in a second .
so in mexi@@ co , citizens , at great risk to themselves , are fighting back to build an effective solution .
do you have a lam@@ inated bad@@ ge , ele@@ an@@ or ?
and of course , they were right .
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot;
something is as@@ ke@@ w here .
program@@ mers take this cap@@ ability for gran@@ ted .
so about six years ago , i started thinking about this problem .
how do you know ?
if you want to bel@@ ong , you need social play .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in li@@ qui@@ dation .
we &apos;re going to start and realize that the entire vi@@ sible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the hu@@ bble space telescope plus our other instru@@ ments , was once in a region that was smaller than an at@@ om .
she was 10@@ 5 years old when i took this picture .
and i think , actually -- thomas sch@@ elling , one of the partici@@ pants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
so this is a viru@@ s-@@ based solar cell .
because it was needed .
so ser@@ gi@@ o -- this re@@ cept@@ ac@@ le of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with bro@@ ken@@ ness , lay under the ru@@ bble for three and a half hours without res@@ cu@@ e .
ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , archi@@ e managed to get per@@ mission to do this .
the in@@ je@@ ction made us not to have mind .
stat@@ us-@@ dri@@ ven , con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous consumption thri@@ ves from the language of no@@ vel@@ ty .
every day he lea@@ ves the wire with a mission .
we &apos;re pur@@ pos@@ ely not sig@@ ning anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones .
i think nothing good will come out of that .
the answer is that what you do , and the details are not terri@@ bly important here , is to make something more el@@ abor@@ ate : you take several different la@@ yers of paper , each one con@@ taining its own little fluid system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ si@@ ded car@@ pe@@ t ta@@ pe , the stuff you use to stick the car@@ pe@@ ts onto the floor .
the global stock@@ pi@@ le of highly en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um is about 1,@@ 300 , at the low end , to about 2,@@ 100 metri@@ c tons .
and when he dar@@ ed to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imag@@ ined .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , except in the bot@@ ani@@ cal gar@@ dens .
that means for every dollar you de@@ posi@@ t , it lo@@ ans out about nine or 10 .
because you know , as a kid you &apos;re embar@@ ras@@ sed and you &apos;re sensi@@ tive , and everyone knows you guys don &apos;t have money .
and it was really moving . and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cli@@ ff about two miles away , where the cont@@ ents of the cap@@ su@@ le were being be@@ amed into space .
yeah , so what we do if we had you , who will get the answer , as a partici@@ p@@ ant , we would have c@@ ali@@ br@@ ated the difficul@@ ty level of the puzz@@ les to your exper@@ ti@@ se .
so steve and i , through mathemati@@ cal analysis , pro@@ pose that there &apos;s actually a very simple phenomenon at the ro@@ ot of this , which lies in our brains .
and over the course of the last six years , it &apos;s spread and it &apos;s spread and it &apos;s spread and it &apos;s spread around the world .
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
we know for example that we now have speci@@ alized eye tra@@ ck@@ ers and in@@ fr@@ ared brain sc@@ ans , mri &apos;s that can de@@ code the signals that our bodies send out when we &apos;re trying to be de@@ cep@@ tive .
and if you can &apos;t grow , you can &apos;t possibly solve large social problems .
what i am is a doctor of intern@@ al medicine who became passion@@ ately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question .
and so , india had to go and play the t@@ 20 world c@@ up , you see .
if you took the same technology and pil@@ ot@@ ed it into one of those remote schools , where the score was 30 percent , and , let &apos;s say , took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .
so , when you &apos;re listening to it@@ un@@ es and your favorite music , that &apos;s really just a bunch of ones and zer@@ os playing very quickly .
again , it &apos;s got technology -- it &apos;s got electro@@ des going into its left and right he@@ mi@@ sp@@ heres ; it &apos;s got a camera on top of its head .
i know this because at do@@ some@@ th@@ ing@@ .@@ org , which is the largest organization for teena@@ gers and social change in america , about six months ago we pi@@ vot@@ ed and started foc@@ using on text mes@@ sa@@ ging .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
an auto@@ graph book , a sou@@ l-@@ sear@@ ching letter .
h@@ ello . you don &apos;t put so@@ da in bot@@ tles .
and i left the room and said , &quot; no way . &quot;
second is that positive emotion habi@@ tu@@ ates . it habi@@ tu@@ ates rapidly , indeed .
now the remarkable thing about blood ves@@ sel@@ s is that they have this ability to ada@@ pt to whatever environment they &apos;re growing in .
so anybody who wants to cop@@ y us and come and join us , go for it .
let me show you what these people do .
n@@ k : he never saw it finished , pop .
empathy , co@@ operation , fairness and reci@@ pro@@ city -- car@@ ing about the well-@@ being of others seems like a very human tra@@ it . but fr@@ ans de wa@@ al shares some surprising videos of behavi@@ or@@ al tests , on pri@@ mat@@ es and other mamm@@ als , that show how many of these moral tra@@ its all of us share . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
for the koran always ur@@ ges us to remember , to remind each other , because the knowledge of truth is within every human being .
they can be with words or without words .
but he said this : &quot; the do@@ g@@ mas of the qui@@ et past are in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the stor@@ my present .
you see here a little video .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard bu@@ chan@@ an ni@@ c@@ ely put in a recent es@@ say where he said , &quot; products are vi@@ vid arguments about how we should live our lives . &quot;
in fact , there &apos;s a sur@@ ge channel where the ti@@ de is moving back and forth , twice a day , pretty rapidly .
and you can get pro@@ fil@@ es of each mp , questions they &apos;ve asked in par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
and , in fact , the first pi@@ one@@ ering treat@@ ments for people , as well as do@@ gs , are already becoming available .
now , they diff@@ er a great deal in terms of the predict@@ ability of time fra@@ mes .
so i &apos;ll give you four .
it &apos;s a cir@@ cular thing .
and that &apos;s more or less the story of the cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s of the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and increasingly , tragi@@ cally , the cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s worl@@ d@@ wide .
and so i built the ven@@ ding machine .
these things are ours .
the field research that we &apos;re doing around the world with indi@@ gen@@ ous peop@@ les .
she &apos;d stand me in the sin@@ k to pe@@ e because there was never room in the toilet .
there are now a couple of security do@@ ors , so you won &apos;t see it quite like this .
putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an on@@ going basis is very practi@@ cal in all public schools .
so i changed the lo@@ cations , and then we found the base pa@@ ir@@ ing , and francis immediately said the cha@@ ins run in absolute dire@@ ctions .
another world is possible .
i &apos;ve got friends who actually never use their own bank c@@ ash machines because there &apos;s the risk that it might disp@@ lay their balance on the screen .
and he said , you know , &quot; this is what &apos;s happening . &quot;
even in the rain , people stood between ma@@ di@@ son and 5@@ th a@@ ven@@ ue under their um@@ br@@ ell@@ as char@@ ging their cell phones from out@@ lets on the street .
ideas ! ted-@@ ster bill g@@ ates says , &quot; i had an idea : fo@@ unding the first micro@@ -@@ computer software company . &quot;
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
i have to use this slide . it &apos;s just the look on the face of the dog .
i &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,@@ 50@@ 0-@@ person ted audience .
here &apos;s the dir@@ ty secret of the air force , you can win by bom@@ bing .
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the cow cros@@ sed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depen@@ ds on your frame of re@@ ference . &quot;
he got tra@@ ded a couple of times , he ended up in the min@@ ors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general mana@@ ger of the o@@ a@@ kl@@ and a &apos;s .
if you live in new york , you know how the bike m@@ essen@@ gers move .
it &apos;s the i@@ ca -- the institute of contemporary art -- in boston , which is on the wat@@ er@@ front .
as a &quot; dy@@ er , &quot; do you know how to ble@@ ach ink mar@@ ks ?
it turns out he &apos;s a member of the russi@@ an adult web@@ ma@@ sters feder@@ ation .
so this is a project i &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front co@@ vers to down@@ grade our super , hy@@ per — to down@@ grade our super , hyper@@ -@@ mobile phones into the essen@@ ce of their function .
and this was to make it look sort of like one of those key@@ smi@@ th &apos;s sh@@ ops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever off@@ ered , you know , all over there .
if you &apos;re up the scale a little bit more , why , a br@@ ass thal@@ i .
we need to , for example , embra@@ ce the big data , the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and le@@ verage big data .
and if fol@@ ding a single praying man@@ ti@@ s from a single un@@ cut square wasn &apos;t interesting enough , then you could do two praying man@@ ti@@ ses from a single un@@ cut square .
this is where it gets weird .
it &apos;s this entire ecosystem of low-@@ cost parts and supp@@ lies that are produced all over the world , literally , and then re@@ distribu@@ ted to basically service this industry , and you can even buy sal@@ va@@ ged parts .
now , &quot; the 9@@ 9 &quot; is not just a com@@ ic book .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
the sun is a very important cu@@ e in the sky for them .
so the next time you get den@@ gue fe@@ ver , if it &apos;s a different stra@@ in , you &apos;re more su@@ sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble , you &apos;re likely to get worse symptoms , and you &apos;re more likely to get the more sever@@ e forms , he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gi@@ c fe@@ ver or sho@@ ck syn@@ dro@@ me .
it really is his name .
it &apos;s happening all over the developed world , probably for loss of habitat , but also because our cities are a little bit more li@@ vable than they have been .
it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
enzy@@ mes that che@@ w things up , anti@@ bodies , it &apos;s all , you know , the fit between a protein and whatever it is grab@@ bing , in this case a smell .
and i want to tell you a story about a personal project .
and i want to make it clear , we don &apos;t view this as the complete math education .
it looked at the inter@@ se@@ ction of race and gender in contemporary american art .
in biosphere 2 i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere , every@@ day , and it had an impact on me , very vi@@ sc@@ er@@ ally , very literally .
it &apos;s about a few people lo@@ ving you up close and about those people being enough .
somebody get the front legs .
what i would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how i work . let &apos;s take &quot; the li@@ on king . &quot;
it &apos;s built deeply into our systems and infrastructure .
so if you go to an african american p@@ ent@@ eco@@ st@@ alist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk , my good@@ ness , they talk well .
and we &apos;ve had a classi@@ c answer for coordin@@ ation costs , which is , if you want to coordin@@ ate the work of a group of people , you start an institution , right ? you raise some resources .
so when i open the bot@@ tle , the al@@ co@@ ho@@ l molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is a very vol@@ ati@@ le sub@@ stance .
so , i left his office and i was walking through the hospital , and that &apos;s when i had my epi@@ ph@@ any .
so , why -- why and where -- did cho@@ p su@@ ey come from ?
is this the end or the beginning ? is god p@@ uni@@ shing me or re@@ war@@ ding me , or is this the roll of the di@@ ce ?
journali@@ sm is about results .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
i think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
not the pain@@ ter , i don &apos;t want to think about the pain@@ ter .
those are ideas which have been accep@@ ted but not imple@@ mented yet .
it &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
thanks very much .
he pi@@ cks up a spo@@ on , pi@@ cks it up , s@@ co@@ ops out some sh@@ red@@ ded whe@@ at and milk , hol@@ ds the spo@@ on level as he transl@@ ates it , moving all these jo@@ in@@ ts simul@@ tane@@ ously , to his mouth , and he doesn &apos;t drop any milk .
the children bar@@ ely went to school , they didn &apos;t know any english -- they &apos;d never seen a computer before , and they didn &apos;t know what the internet was .
it &apos;s going to be two years of studio work .
for a start , one has to cu@@ rate a z@@ illi@@ on different sources of facts and data , and we built quite a pipeline of mathemati@@ ca autom@@ ation and human dom@@ ain experts for doing this .
so what can we do ? how can we pre@@ p@@ are and ada@@ pt ?
so here we were , a nuclear physi@@ cist , an intern@@ ist , soon jo@@ ined by car@@ rie hr@@ us@@ ka , a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the ent@@ ren@@ ched world of mam@@ mo@@ graphy with a machine that was held together by du@@ ct ta@@ pe .

those of you in bri@@ tain will know about what &apos;s become rather a cele@@ br@@ ated case of a woman called s@@ ally c@@ lar@@ k , who had two babies who died suddenly .
super@@ flu@@ i@@ ds are one of the most fragi@@ le things we &apos;ve ever discovered .
we &apos;ve got to get the story out now . thank you very much .
and so one philosop@@ her even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the french revolution .
these laptops , when a child op@@ ens them up , they communicate with every single child in the classroom , within that school , within that village .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extra@@ pol@@ ating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the pri@@ mal universe looked like .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever been to a je@@ wish we@@ dding , but what they do is , they take a light bulb and they sm@@ ash it .
until i got to my house , where the cli@@ ent was my wife .
second , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al communities around the world don &apos;t have the auth@@ ority to mon@@ it@@ or the resources to create the reser@@ ve and en@@ force it .
we have an awful , awful reality right now .
right . we did a little bit of it here with 1,@@ 500 people in long be@@ ach , and we do it in a classroom at harvard with about 1,000 students .
well , then let &apos;s go to a sim@@ pler explan@@ ation .
and this is not an ability ; it &apos;s a drive and a moti@@ vation .
and at that population level , our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth .
and you can also trade real hundre@@ d-@@ dollar bills for fake hundre@@ d-@@ dollar bills and make a don@@ ation to the hundred dollar laptop project , which is now known as one laptop per child .
again of course that &apos;s what we do , both in a molecular way , and also in an out@@ ward way , but i think about the molecular stuff .
and then you could decide : &quot; is this an insect i want to kill , or an insect i don &apos;t want to kill ? &quot;
what does this compassion ent@@ a@@ il ?
we &apos;ve changed all our light bul@@ bs to ener@@ g@@ y-@@ sa@@ vers , and you should do the same thing , but changing all your light bul@@ bs to ener@@ g@@ y-@@ sa@@ vers sa@@ ves as much energy in a year as moving to a wal@@ k@@ able city does in a week .
that can mean different things in different countries .
you know , that &apos;s the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that &apos;s truly different .
you &apos;ll need to attra@@ ct fir@@ ms , who will come hi@@ re the people who move there first .
but my jo@@ yful period was mar@@ red by so@@ le@@ m@@ n and mor@@ bi@@ d thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison &apos;s high-@@ security death row , as this was the only rou@@ te to take me to the ma@@ k@@ es@@ hi@@ ft oper@@ ating room .
so , in conclusion , i think the message is clear .
and thank you very much .
we rever@@ se engineer lab equipment .

now having seen that -- and i &apos;ve seen it hundreds of times , because i use this in every talk i give -- i still can &apos;t see that they &apos;re the same size and shape , and i dou@@ bt that you can either .
and this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the pie@@ ce@@ me@@ al approach does not work .
here &apos;s the architecture machine group , the pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or of the media lab , in 198@@ 1 .
do you know that bi@@ po@@ lar disorder is ni@@ ck@@ named the ce@@ o disease ?
i fell in love with the way things moved , so i started to expl@@ ore motion by making little fli@@ p@@ books .
the two mar@@ ches jo@@ ined together , and they continued their path towards the state capital .
so here is the bottom line .
i said , &quot; can i see some evidence for this ? &quot;
cop@@ pol@@ a &apos;s script descri@@ bes these guys as , &quot; ex@@ hau@@ sted in shirt sle@@ ev@@ es .
well , it &apos;s very simple . what kind of economic engine would keep chur@@ ning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it ?
and that is the power of transformation .
the second is , and this is a real world stat@@ ement , they &apos;re cheap .
i became very interested , and i wrote about a couple .
my home would have to be whatever i car@@ ried around inside me .
the pilot , i knew , was called tro@@ y . i was expe@@ cting someone called tro@@ y that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .
we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-@@ range motion .
for the lon@@ gest time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
&quot; he just can &apos;t act . &quot; &quot; you call that singing ? she can &apos;t hit the notes . &quot;
one is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lan@@ es of the road , there &apos;s the ob@@ stac@@ les -- and con@@ v@@ ey this information to the dri@@ ver .
who is she ?
have you got his name ?
those of you who have a hard time calcul@@ ating what that means -- in the average con@@ su@@ mer environment we &apos;re in in the u.s .
so an interesting question is , does the social em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment really matter ? does it matter that it &apos;s a robot ?
here they &apos;ve come all the way across the atlantic to make all this money .
and this is how you look at africa .
so this one here , this is the 198@@ 0 ol@@ ympi@@ cs .
it &apos;s a pretty har@@ ro@@ wing lin@@ ka@@ ge between what &apos;s happening to our environment and what &apos;s happening to our human rights .
this is part of cyber@@ crime which is a $ 2-@@ trilli@@ on-@@ a-@@ year dis@@ continu@@ ity in the global economy .
there &apos;s a factory out there making our children blind , not able to provide them with food , not able to provide them with vitamin a .

and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little pr@@ on@@ gs in the center of this picture .
the se@@ cular world is full of holes .
think about how many letters in the title .
that &apos;s a very important compon@@ ent of roots and sho@@ ots , with older kids talking to younger ones .
we think of it as a comp@@ act urban cell .
i &apos;d like everyone to understand preci@@ sely what the phosphorus issue is .
there is two ways to be pa@@ st-@@ ori@@ ented , two ways to be future .
in 1950 , turkey had the first free and fair elections , which ended the more auto@@ cra@@ tic se@@ cular regi@@ me , which was the beginning of turkey .
people have a more open morning , they can actually think , and you &apos;ll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do , you don &apos;t actually have to do .
we think we can ju@@ dge people on their expres@@ sions .
there is such a difference within sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
i would much rather invest in somebody -- you know , take a chance on somebody -- who i know is straight than somebody where there &apos;s any possible question of , you know , who are they looking out for , and what &apos;s going on .
has anyone here ever been to school ?

and you have huge differences within countries also .
so , a super@@ condu@@ ctor is defined by two properties .
single mother , hiv positive .
even when i do an art show , i really think about , what should people walk away with ?
and much to my surprise , they were noticed .
all we ask is , &quot; what ser@@ ves my interests ? &quot;
one was -- never be late . never be late .
from the ru@@ le@@ book : n@@ omen@@ cl@@ ature is a tool .
so here &apos;s is a syste@@ m-@@ chan@@ ger , and it seems to be cat@@ ching .
how many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more fe@@ mal@@ es in the world ?
thank you .
but my argument is , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as ? &quot;
right now today , in o@@ sl@@ o as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their pa@@ y@@ ments to governments for extra@@ cting oil in developing countries .
i &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
so , we drop in the water , and we just sort of go over the edge of this cli@@ ff , and then we just start dropping , dropping , dropping .
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
re@@ ed ha@@ st@@ ings is here . he clearly saw that that was a moment , that was an in@@ fle@@ ction point that he could do something with .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspi@@ re us .
this cannot be . this cannot be that i &apos;m expe@@ cting a certain number of sk@@ et@@ ches , and to me that &apos;s my qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ cation meth@@ od for quali@@ fying a team .
that &apos;s a hypothe@@ tical example of course .
we get the gener@@ ators from the companies .
can we get complex 3d structure automatically as@@ sem@@ bling in in@@ organic systems ?

i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . i had a right .
there &apos;s this one trial he ran many years after world war i@@ i .
ants are not known to occur in red@@ wood trees , curi@@ ously enough , and we wondered whether this ant , this species of ant , was only en@@ demi@@ c to that one tree , or possibly to that gro@@ ve .
and i said to them , &quot; look , there &apos;s a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america . &quot;
harmon@@ y is the sugge@@ sti@@ on of a thing that is much larger than resol@@ ution .

actually , that whole row isn &apos;t right .
in som@@ alia , in mal@@ i , in nigeria , in iraq , in afghanistan , pakistan , there are groups that cla@@ im to be the inher@@ it@@ ors of the leg@@ acy of o@@ sam@@ a bin laden .

we take out the things that aren &apos;t plasti@@ cs , such as the met@@ als they mis@@ sed , car@@ pe@@ ting , fo@@ am , ru@@ b@@ ber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
we &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for re@@ aching the top , the sum@@ mit of mo@@ unt sustain@@ ability .
okay .
and you wei@@ gh these options out -- you do the simple co@@ st-@@ benefit analysis , and you decide whether it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while to com@@ mit the crime or not .
so i now have these 7@@ 2 different data points , which , to be fair , is a lot .
now , when your state is collap@@ sing , your economy is head@@ ing south at a rate of kn@@ ots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14@@ ,000 men and women whose chi@@ ef skills are sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lance , are s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ing , building underground networks and killing people .
what is this , what is this , what am i telling ?
now i am a belie@@ ver in democracy .
and i re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ unken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy c@@ ash and this was the guy .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-@@ plus percent sub@@ si@@ dies .

what &apos;s going to happen in the end , it &apos;s not going to be just humans coloni@@ zing space , it &apos;s going to be life moving out from the earth , moving it into its kingdom . and the kingdom of life , of course , is going to be the universe . and if life is already there , it makes it much more exciting , in the short run .
you need to somehow find the fi@@ t@@ ness function .
&quot; there &apos;s a flip side to everything , &quot; the saying goes , and in 2 minutes , derek si@@ vers shows this is true in a few ways you might not expect .
i have no staff ; it &apos;s all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands .
as it was the cu@@ sto@@ m of the time , cop@@ erni@@ c@@ us was actually simply bu@@ ried in an un@@ mar@@ ked gra@@ ve , together with 14 others in that ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
i mean , people like bill bu@@ x@@ ton have been playing around with it in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
everything &apos;s gotten sim@@ pler in design , and here &apos;s this me@@ ga air@@ port , and god , i just -- i took a picture .
i went to the crea@@ tioni@@ sts &apos; museum .
this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
well , my under@@ gradu@@ ates and the people i work with haven &apos;t discovered this , so we actually have people do something al@@ tru@@ i@@ stic and do something fun , and to contra@@ st it .
do you have any children ? were your children vac@@ cin@@ ated ? &quot;

now , if you don &apos;t trust someone , you place re@@ stri@@ ctions on them , right ?
let &apos;s find out .
19@@ 33 , ver@@ a mahl@@ er found , when it was ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged by others , it felt real in the mind .
so , doctors pres@@ cri@@ be medi@@ cation .
now , i wasn &apos;t just obsessed . i was ou@@ tra@@ ged .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
we haven &apos;t be@@ gun to sc@@ rat@@ ch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religions do with travel .
and we ran into a far@@ c pat@@ ro@@ l at da@@ wn , so it was quite har@@ ro@@ wing .
so last ju@@ ly ... i moved from america in jun@@ e , ran in ju@@ ly ele@@ ction and won .
then along comes cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine .
he was the victi@@ m of the fir@@ st-@@ ever su@@ i@@ cide bom@@ b in iraq .
very wise man , because he knew i would , i felt like i was making the decision on my own , and he knew i wouldn &apos;t choose st. john &apos;s , so i went to hol@@ y name high school , which was a tough transition because , like i said , i didn &apos;t play spor@@ ts , and it was very focused on spor@@ ts , but i took sol@@ ace in mr. shi@@ l@@ ale &apos;s art room .
and i &apos;m gla@@ d to see their discover@@ ies coming out of the lab and into the world .
when hom@@ er simp@@ son needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clo@@ ck , but the whole fre@@ aking cal@@ en@@ dar , he comes up with 0@@ 400 on the birthday of the baby j@@ es@@ us .

stories matter .
the fact that a single program@@ mer can , without having to move into a professional relation to an institution , improve lin@@ u@@ x once and never be seen from again , should terri@@ fy ball@@ mer .
&quot; ti@@ pping point &quot; author mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well gets inside the food industry &apos;s pur@@ suit of the perfect sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce -- and makes a larger argument about the nature of choice and happiness .
the cre@@ ase pattern shown here is the underlying blu@@ e@@ print for an ori@@ gam@@ i figure .
our partici@@ pants would carry electronic pa@@ gers for a week at a time , and we &apos;d page them throughout the day and ev@@ en@@ ings at random times .
this photo : this woman , man , i feel her .
but this gives control to the provi@@ der , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can ad@@ just the flow based on the per@@ cent@@ age of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
okay , i hear you were laugh@@ ing ner@@ v@@ ously because you too could hear that the dri@@ ll was a little bit sharp , the in@@ ton@@ ation was a little questi@@ on@@ able .
being human is an art form .
and maybe if we all tried to read our fe@@ ars , we too would be less often swa@@ yed by the most sal@@ aci@@ ous among them .
so if we wanted to translate wikipedia into span@@ ish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
she &apos;s in the studio . he &apos;s got her in the studio , they &apos;re together .
because i hadn &apos;t told them what i was doing , because i was so up@@ set with the story they &apos;d run .
as i said , i started to do these things 75 years ago .
and i &apos;m not saying this is a good thing , but this is a thing , right ?
and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
the one on the right is the one who gets gra@@ pes .
now , the reason , i think , that this is the case is that human beings as@@ semble themselves and form a kind of super@@ organ@@ ism .
the woman on the other end of the line , we &apos;ll call her car@@ ol , was pani@@ cked .
they took one look at the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine in tasmani@@ a , and they thought , hang on , this is not going to work .
these are the bones left after the best meat has been taken .
what is your strate@@ gy in your hou@@ seh@@ old ?
but there &apos;s a far worse dan@@ ger con@@ fron@@ ting us .
there have been 30 no@@ vel emerging communi@@ c@@ able diseases that begin in animals that have jump@@ ed species in the last 30 years .
that &apos;s it .
so what happens when people win the lot@@ ter@@ y is , number one , they spend all the money and go into de@@ bt , and number two , all of their friends and everyone they &apos;ve ever met find them and bu@@ g them for money .
and that &apos;s what i want to share with you today -- the top five re@@ gre@@ ts of the dying .
and one of the re@@ curr@@ ing the@@ mes , by the way , that in the work was a kind of ho@@ sti@@ lity toward the museum itself , and asking about the conven@@ tions of the museum , like the wall , the white wall .
when wal@@ -@@ m@@ art dec@@ lar@@ es it &apos;s going to go green and be profi@@ table , it has a powerful impact on other great institutions .
and that &apos;s sort of what i &apos;ve been doing .
so my un@@ cle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
all the points , all the lines -- it &apos;s incredible .
if we could get evolution into the material world , then i pro@@ pose we should have a general theory of evolution .
if they don &apos;t have any damage , they go to the gro@@ cer@@ y .
but imagine what the properties of this li@@ me@@ stone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere .
la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , thank you very , very much .
so they &apos;re not a don@@ ation .
but i think when you guys start buying tick@@ ets and flying sub-@@ or@@ bi@@ tal fli@@ ghts to space , very soon -- wait a minute , what &apos;s happening here , we &apos;ll have military figh@@ ters with sub-@@ or@@ bi@@ tal cap@@ ability , and i think very soon this .
without the coun@@ cil the chi@@ ef can &apos;t pass any law , and if the chi@@ ef doesn &apos;t gover@@ n according to the will of the people he will be re@@ moved .

and i started thinking about a coun@@ sel@@ ing program .
and these are fl@@ y@@ tra@@ p an@@ em@@ ones .
in bal@@ lo@@ oning , or in life , how do we change altitude ?
of course , computers and electronics are now america &apos;s biggest industry , while ty@@ pe@@ writer makers have v@@ ani@@ shed .
and mr. ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i knows it , as he si@@ ts at@@ op this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth .
and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice .
who is it who &apos;s going to get enough attention from the world ?
that was a great day for my mother .
so dan demon@@ str@@ ates the many self-@@ lear@@ ners who take this course off the web , on their own tra@@ ction , on their own initiative , and it &apos;s quite amazing because these people cannot care less about gra@@ des .
it &apos;s not that it gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es peace with itself or with its neighb@@ ors .
t@@ m : thank you very much .
there is no tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory of progress . there &apos;s no pyrami@@ d that conveni@@ ently places victori@@ an england at the a@@ pe@@ x and des@@ c@@ ends down the f@@ lan@@ ks to the so-called primi@@ tives of the world .
he just had the rules , he had the nor@@ ms , and he tried to use them .
and if you &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating a dense information jung@@ le , coming across a beautiful graphic or a lo@@ vely data visuali@@ zation , it &apos;s a re@@ lief , it &apos;s like coming across a clear@@ ing in the jung@@ le .
when i took this picture , the window was fro@@ zen because of the mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure of the night .
the other is power diff@@ u@@ sion , the way power is moving from all states west or east to non-@@ state ac@@ tors .
and as it happens , shakespeare was onto something here , as he generally was .
ali@@ sa mill@@ er , head of public radio international , talks about why -- though we want to know more about the world than ever -- the us media is actually showing less . e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening stat@@ s and graph@@ s .
the d@@ ots ex@@ hi@@ bit human quali@@ ties . they kind of have their own physics , and they s@@ warm wil@@ dly around , kind of explor@@ ing the world of life .

this is a photograph i found lying in a gu@@ tter in new york city about 10 years ago .
thank you .

this is no surprise though if you look at the insi@@ ghts of contemporary psych@@ ology .
isn &apos;t life about the journey , not really the dest@@ ination ?
but then , we &apos;re just a community group , you know .
the wonderful n@@ elli@@ e m@@ ck@@ a@@ y s@@ ings &quot; mother of pe@@ ar@@ l &quot; and &quot; if i had you &quot; from her spar@@ kl@@ ing set at ted@@ 2008 .
it may seem that we &apos;re living in a bor@@ der@@ less world where ideas , goo@@ ds and people flow fre@@ ely from nation to nation . we &apos;re not even close , says pan@@ ka@@ j g@@ he@@ ma@@ w@@ at . with great data , he argu@@ es that there &apos;s a del@@ ta between per@@ ception and reality in a world that &apos;s maybe not so hyper@@ connected after all .
ni@@ co@@ le : no .
look , inv@@ ade , sub@@ due them , take their resources .
and he wasn &apos;t wearing swe@@ at@@ pants , he was wearing a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit .
that &apos;s what we just did . your action video game player has a sp@@ an of about six to seven objects of attention , which is what is shown in this video here .
and , believe it or not , if i show you a picture of your mother -- i &apos;m talking about normal people -- you start swe@@ ating .
and we were el@@ ated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investi@@ g@@ ators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense brea@@ sts , compar@@ ing a scre@@ ening mam@@ mo@@ gram to an m@@ bi .
and empathy has sort of two quali@@ ties .
their poverty was my single story of them .
now , there &apos;s 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analy@@ ses .
but it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pa@@ irs in that sequ@@ ence .
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comm@@ ents about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don &apos;t know the real people ; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publi@@ ci@@ zing , effectively , my fil@@ thy work .
it &apos;s not , histori@@ cally , totally accu@@ rate that she &apos;s the first program@@ mer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
here &apos;s what happens if you don &apos;t address this stuff .
that is a point that is not coming out from the bible , but it &apos;s something that really ac@@ compani@@ ed humanity .
and this is actually what it looks like , hundreds of blood ves@@ sel@@ s all growing toward the center of the wo@@ und .
and even 20 years later , there was only 10 law@@ yers in the country , so consequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-@@ year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; why are you here ? &quot; women would say , &quot; well i &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband com@@ mitted a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot;
they are 7@@ ,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
so , let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it .
she then as@@ signed these works ra@@ cial identi@@ ties , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bo@@ b col@@ esc@@ ot@@ t , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american artist ; le@@ on gol@@ u@@ b , a white artist .
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually per@@ forming terri@@ bly .
over the next five minutes , my inten@@ tion is to transform your relationship with sound .
my time is nearly up .
he went there after the death of his wife of small@@ po@@ x and brought his two young children .
which was a very good thing , provi@@ ding low cost clothing .
finally , truth will be brought here .
while these past weeks have been a time of national ex@@ hi@@ lar@@ ation in this country , it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done .
the secret to biology is , it builds compu@@ tation into the way it makes things . so this little thing here , pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ase , is essentially a super@@ computer designed for repli@@ cating dna .
and the result is sort of gra@@ ti@@ f@@ y@@ ingly per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al .
here we have di@@ o@@ genes with his lan@@ tern .
this is a series of lam@@ ps i made . this is a ben@@ to box lamp : it &apos;s sort of a plastic ri@@ ce lamp ; it &apos;s very friend@@ ly .
that &apos;s someone who is desig@@ ning a habitat on another planet &apos;s dream .
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &apos;t do anything funny .
2030 -- two billion squ@@ at@@ ters , one in four people on the planet .
well , to answer the slightly easi@@ er question first , about 10,000 years ago , i would say , is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east , known as the ferti@@ le c@@ res@@ cent .
so , i started taking art courses , and i found a way to make sculp@@ ture that brought together my love for being very preci@@ se with my hands , with coming up with different kinds of logical flo@@ ws of energy through a system .
the world record was eight minutes and 5@@ 8 seconds , held by tom si@@ et@@ as , that guy with the whale lungs i told you about .
and mi@@ ke , who i met at gala@@ pa@@ gos , a tri@@ p which i won at ted , is lea@@ ving notes on cyber@@ space where he is chr@@ oni@@ cl@@ ing his journey through cancer .
are there good news ? of course , there are good news . there are lots of good news .
for instance , here &apos;s the tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory of mar@@ c ch@@ ag@@ all , an artist born in 18@@ 8@@ 7 .
the com@@ mit@@ ment is there .
and in the case of the whale h@@ unt , also this idea of an exci@@ tement level .
and so in my building , which is full of sun@@ light and full of flo@@ wers , we believe in hope and human possibilities .
and he happened to tell me about a conference he &apos;d just returned from in israel , where they were talking about a new type of gam@@ ma dete@@ ctor .
they were making deta@@ iled journ@@ als of their spending , their mo@@ od , their symptoms , their treat@@ ments .
and you know , valve -- you know , port@@ al -- is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to disc@@ uss when we ac@@ qui@@ red the video games , what to do with violence .
but i am also trying to make s@@ ani@@ tary pad with the good c@@ ot@@ ton . it &apos;s not working .
it &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
in some places up to 10 times larger biom@@ ass inside the reser@@ ves .
and it was because of scen@@ es like this .
there is an inter@@ -@@ school athle@@ tic competi@@ tion that is held every year in ban@@ gal@@ ore , where 5,000 children participa@@ te from 1@@ 40 best schools in the city .
now if you take the mam@@ mary gland and spread it and take the fat away , on a dish it looks like that .
a lot of change .
and he received fir@@ st-@@ line che@@ mo@@ therapy .
this is ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square .
but what about that guy ?
and it depen@@ ded on if you were attac@@ ked by a li@@ on or a le@@ op@@ ard or a r@@ hin@@ o or an elephant -- and when you had to run away , and when you couldn &apos;t run away , and when you had to climb a tree -- when you could never climb a tree .
we &apos;ve not been focused , we &apos;ve not done what we had to do , and now we &apos;re fac@@ ing the potential of bad , hell on earth .
you &apos;ve got a co@@ il .
civil wars and ethni@@ c confli@@ cts have brought the world incredible suffering , but stefan wol@@ ff &apos;s fig@@ ures show that , in the last 20 years , their number has ste@@ adi@@ ly de@@ cre@@ ased . he extra@@ cts critical les@@ sons from north@@ ern ir@@ el@@ and , li@@ beri@@ a , ti@@ m@@ or and more to show that leadership , diplom@@ acy and institu@@ tional design are our three most effective weapons in wa@@ ging peace .
it &apos;s important to show not just to show the leader , but the follo@@ wers , because you find that new follo@@ wers e@@ mu@@ late the follo@@ wers , not the leader .
and we said , &quot; we get out and walk ? &quot;
this is the curve for j@@ op@@ lin .
ro@@ bin in@@ ce : science versus wonder ?
that is , almost everybody sees the planet satur@@ n .
the national movement of india was te@@ stim@@ ony to that .
so , you can put circu@@ it components on the sta@@ ples , like a light bulb and a light switch .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll give you a few quot@@ es .
the second year , it was a total of 15 million .
the place that i turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of , and that is a brazi@@ li@@ an named ser@@ gi@@ o vi@@ ei@@ ra de m@@ ello who , as chris said , was blo@@ wn up in iraq in 2003 .
just incredible .
the navi@@ g@@ ation is difficult .
those dea@@ f people discover community somehow in adol@@ escence .
now , &quot; ec@@ st@@ asy &quot; in gre@@ ek meant simply to stand to the side of something .
you &apos;ve got this huge network of cells inter@@ acting with each other -- about 100 million of them , sending about 10 quad@@ ri@@ lli@@ on of these pul@@ ses around every second .
it was cho@@ king with smo@@ ke .
we identify one set of people in all of these practi@@ ces who we call can@@ ny out@@ la@@ ws .
and you all know roughly the story .
and now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
this is like , if you &apos;re familiar with any of the tele@@ pres@@ ence robots today -- this is mi@@ rr@@ oring that situation .
so you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; a sl@@ ing@@ shot or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . which would actually be better ? &quot;
finally , lo@@ cation causes the feelings to move to their posi@@ tions on a world map showing the geo@@ graphi@@ cal distribu@@ tion of feelings .
and take action to make it happen , unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we &apos;ve been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security .
but for every disa@@ ster we had , the marath@@ on found ways to bring people together .
so , our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago .
well , one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
because when we looked at the four plat@@ forms around the site , one of which is an up@@ grade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be mo@@ ve@@ able to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
and al@@ an turing defined the turing test , which is essentially saying , we &apos;ll know if something &apos;s intelligent if it beha@@ ves identical to a human .
he said , &quot; long story .
i happen to believe it was a great error .
the present jo@@ ins a flow of time from before and after .
we &apos;ll go , &quot; o@@ oh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
and we &apos;d actually take an at@@ las off the shelf , and we &apos;d flip through until we found this mysteri@@ ous country .
that &apos;s what we must a@@ im for in the next 20 to 30 years .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink them and keep the v@@ acu@@ um .
z@@ k : it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l.a. , and we were at star@@ bu@@ cks having coffee with ro@@ man cop@@ pol@@ a .
i &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
audience member : how far along are we in being able to de@@ ter@@ mine whether someone is actually carrying , whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full-@@ blo@@ wn ?
it goes back to a time when i was very often sta@@ ying in hotels .
they are tra@@ ced just by their known anat@@ omi@@ cal path along v@@ as@@ cul@@ ature .
show us some pri@@ mary cancer .
i have one image in my office .
my agency is working closely with colum@@ bia university and others to shine a light on these issues .
they pul@@ se through my organs and legs and burn up my e@@ ars .
one of the acu@@ men fund fel@@ lo@@ ws at my organization , su@@ ra@@ j sud@@ ha@@ k@@ ar , has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person &apos;s shoes and lead from that perspective .
let me try to take this one step further .
and then we have inten@@ tions .
well , i was born ... no .
this is the history of the mar@@ ines -- small wars , small arms .
they all came in there , and i told them that there &apos;s some really difficult stuff on this computer .
and this is a little phy@@ lo@@ genetic tree to see how it &apos;s related to other viruses .
all you do is nu@@ ke it . what could be better ?
there are some very light people , some extremely heavy people , maybe people with a lot of bul@@ k up top .
business as usual in heal@@ th@@ care is broken and we &apos;ve got to do something different .
because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have cho@@ sen to interact with .
you know , in the communication of science there is this ob@@ session with seri@@ ousness .
the third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
there &apos;s nowhere to flus@@ h .
this is a re@@ de@@ mp@@ tion we can all as@@ pire to .
and finally , it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able .
thank you .
we built it at my home , which means that i got a little extra help from my three-@@ year-old son ra@@ mon .
one guy off@@ ered free secon@@ dar@@ y school education to all , not just 30 percent .
the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you &apos;ve talked about emergen@@ t behavior , when you &apos;ve talked about colle@@ ctive intelligence , the best way to get people to kind of wra@@ p their heads around that is to ask , who builds a neighborhood ?
but it really open@@ ed my eyes to how much of my life i spent just se@@ clu@@ ding away , be it e@@ mail or social po@@ sts or what@@ not , even though it wasn &apos;t really -- there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pres@@ sing .
at its zen@@ i@@ th , g@@ .@@ m@@ . emplo@@ yed hundreds of thousands , facebook fewer than 10,000 .
and right here guys , sili@@ con val@@ ley , i mean -- how many people have an iphone on them right now ?
but the si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders dem@@ and it .
we are already doing so on about 15 million he@@ ct@@ ar@@ es on five continents , and people who understand far more about carbon than i do calcu@@ late that , for illu@@ stra@@ tive pur@@ pos@@ es , if we do what i am showing you here , we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and saf@@ ely store it in the gras@@ s@@ land so@@ ils for thousands of years , and if we just do that on about half the world &apos;s gras@@ s@@ lands that i &apos;ve shown you , we can take us back to pre-@@ industrial levels , while feeding people .
and the bigger the telescope , the bigger that universe becomes .
we &apos;ve all seen the photos of the collap@@ sed buildings in haiti .
today , indian women have a si@@ z@@ able life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy edge over indian men .
j@@ ac@@ qu@@ eline no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz : patient capi@@ tali@@ sm
but my head un@@ wra@@ ps around what appe@@ ars li@@ mit@@ less , man &apos;s creative violence .
it &apos;s good to see you again .
in the 20th century , it was tot@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an@@ ism .
so i &apos;m very passionate about this research and i really want to continue it and exp@@ and it to more dis@@ orders besi@@ des asth@@ ma , more res@@ pi@@ rat@@ ory dis@@ orders , as well as more pollu@@ tants .
honor har@@ ger : a history of the universe in sound
but i did in fact get married in it .
we could talk about government data , enter@@ prise data is really important , there &apos;s scientific data , there &apos;s personal data , there &apos;s weather data , there &apos;s data about events , there &apos;s data about talks , and there &apos;s news and there &apos;s all kinds of stuff .
but let me also thank the incredible cre@@ ators who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our television scre@@ ens throughout all these ages of television .
mov@@ ements are spr@@ inging up .
on a positive note , we at last have someone in the white house who has consi@@ st@@ ently spo@@ ken out against these cor@@ ro@@ sive enti@@ ties .
but how do you re@@ tain somebody , when it &apos;s never done ?
but we also have a strai@@ ght@@ forward political impact .
and in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
since that time , he &apos;s continued to work with his people , and not only the as@@ han@@ in@@ ka nation , but all the peop@@ les of the amaz@@ on and beyond .
no to a new phar@@ a@@ oh , because who@@ ever comes next should understand that we will never be ru@@ led by another di@@ ct@@ ator .
and a variety of other studies have shown that the micro@@ bi@@ al community that lives in and on us helps in development of the imm@@ une system , helps in fighting off pa@@ tho@@ gens , helps in our met@@ abo@@ li@@ sm , and determin@@ ing our met@@ abo@@ lic rate , probably determin@@ es our od@@ or , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
dan pin@@ k : the puzzle of moti@@ vation
nee@@ d@@ less to list them here , and there are more compe@@ tent people to talk about this .
this is the first time it has ever been recorded .
we need peace , and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace .
she said , &quot; if you &apos;re talking about hope and peace , ring this .
they school as adol@@ esc@@ ents , and become be@@ he@@ mot@@ h lon@@ ers as adul@@ ts .
and our own opportunity to make something new there ?
bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic problems : ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a gui@@ dance note going out for all of the hospi@@ t@@ als in the country .
or maybe it &apos;s because when i was a teenager back in the &apos; 50s , my un@@ cle hen@@ ry -- having den@@ o@@ un@@ ced the k@@ u klu@@ x kl@@ an and been bom@@ bed for his trouble and had cros@@ ses bur@@ ned in his y@@ ard , living under death threat -- took his wife and children to mas@@ sach@@ u@@ set@@ ts for sa@@ fe@@ ty and went back to south carolina to face down the kl@@ an alone .
and there &apos;s de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion .
let &apos;s talk about a bat@@ tle space .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for off@@ ering high-@@ quality chil@@ d@@ care to their grand@@ children , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the work@@ force and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-@@ time care@@ ta@@ kers of their children .
but i did go on to be a reas@@ on@@ ably ast@@ ute , argu@@ ably worl@@ d-@@ class wor@@ rier .
what does it look like if that &apos;s not the case ? and how can we embra@@ ce that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to susta@@ in everybody ?
so this system that was built for ted is here to illu@@ stra@@ te that it is techni@@ cally possible to actually dep@@ lo@@ y a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly co@@ st-@@ effective to use in places like africa and other parts of the world .
now what this suggests is that how women view religion &apos;s role in society is sha@@ ped more by their own country &apos;s culture and context than one mon@@ oli@@ th@@ ic view that religion is simply bad for women .
both of these design for the as@@ sumption that people like to create and we want to share .
south africa just released some li@@ on bones onto the market .
we have a pra@@ m service on tu@@ es@@ day mor@@ n@@ ings for mu@@ ms and their pre-@@ school children .
we can &apos;t tell where are the wat@@ ering holes like we can on an african pla@@ in .
and through this technology , being able to be an active partici@@ p@@ ant in their grand@@ children &apos;s lives in a way that &apos;s not possible today .
i couldn &apos;t agree more . science couldn &apos;t agree more .
and so there &apos;s a very instin@@ ctive way in which we brie@@ fly trans@@ mit emotions to each other .
how do you con@@ dense that ?
one tai@@ wan@@ ese production studio would interpre@@ t american politics in 3d .
the age of the universe , between now and the big bang , is a hundred billion in dog years .
yeah , he has a heart of gold ; don &apos;t touch the fru@@ it@@ ca@@ ke . right ?
benjamin wall@@ ace : now , that &apos;s about all the vide@@ ot@@ ape that rema@@ ins of an ev@@ ent that set off the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ running my@@ ster@@ y in the modern wine world .
we can do things that ro@@ vers can &apos;t do and l@@ anders can &apos;t do : we can fly above mountains , vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , impact c@@ rat@@ ers ; we fly over val@@ le@@ ys ; we can fly over surface magne@@ ti@@ sm , the po@@ lar ca@@ ps , sub@@ surface water ; and we can search for life on mars .
the four@@ th compon@@ ent here is that re@@ gre@@ t is what psych@@ ologists call per@@ sever@@ ative .

&quot; my prin@@ ter prin@@ ts a blank page after every docum@@ ent . &quot;
we &apos;re not open to a discussion of elimin@@ ating it .
it &apos;s about 50 feet wide and re@@ ce@@ des about half a mile -- row after row of cells that , inside , res@@ em@@ ble vol@@ ta &apos;s battery , with three important differences .
e@@ o : well , we thank you again for coming to the ted stage .
and i thought that was worth sharing .
they did not share the same anti-@@ coloni@@ al hy@@ pe that you can find in some other countries in the region .
but we don &apos;t bo@@ ther to say so , and this is why my friend uses &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y agno@@ stic &quot; as a lab@@ el for what most people would call athei@@ st .
that &apos;s not in@@ significant .
ste@@ ph@@ ano : out of the moon , i do as@@ sure the@@ e .
it was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ow@@ ner@@ ship .
it had some str@@ ings and pul@@ le@@ ys and some spr@@ ings .
in fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with smart , ambi@@ ti@@ ous men whose business instin@@ cts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ce@@ os who had win@@ ed and din@@ ed me six months earlier when i was a ri@@ sing star in the mis@@ sour@@ i sen@@ ate .
the gre@@ e@@ ks have actually managed to produce something called ret@@ sin@@ a , which even ta@@ stes shi@@ te when you &apos;re in gre@@ e@@ ce .
you &apos;ll notice the lim@@ p ci@@ gar@@ ette han@@ ging out of his mouth , and &quot; im@@ po@@ t@@ ence &quot; -- the head@@ line is , &quot; im@@ po@@ tent &quot; -- it &apos;s not em@@ phy@@ se@@ ma .
you had to do everything to get your phone .
we &apos;re already starting to see early reti@@ rement occur this year .
so my wife sm@@ ells ni@@ cer than i do , or i just stin@@ k more than she does .
and that meant they were market based , or they were government ow@@ ned , depen@@ ding on what kind of system they were in . and this charac@@ teri@@ zed and an@@ ch@@ ored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years .
now , they normally re@@ tra@@ ct as soon as a cra@@ b tou@@ ches them .
we use a modi@@ fied in@@ k@@ je@@ t prin@@ ter , and we print ge@@ ome@@ try .
and over the next 18 years have almost tri@@ pl@@ ed .
so kal@@ u@@ z@@ a said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more preci@@ se .
but i was not limited when i s@@ ang , and as air came up from my lungs , through my vo@@ cal cor@@ ds and passed my li@@ ps as sound , it was the clo@@ sest thing i had ever come to tran@@ scen@@ dence .
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop .
if i couldn &apos;t sell all four , i could at least get one .
half the people who developed the food pyrami@@ d have ties to agri@@ business .
since they &apos;re doing some of these same jobs , maybe they should have some of those things .
some of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
it &apos;s a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story .
we can see predi@@ ctions of galaxies forming , of galaxies colli@@ ding into each other , of new solar systems .
if i reach out and pull an object , another neur@@ on will fire , comm@@ and@@ ing me to pull that object .
and this is one of my favorite pl@@ ots in social sci@@ ences .
now i &apos;m going to take you to a different contin@@ ent . this is india , and this is the most com@@ mon@@ ly used cooking fuel in india ; it &apos;s cow dung .
really , this is more about putting the player in the role of geor@@ ge luc@@ as , you know ?
should i ski@@ p that part ?
but how should we honor fe@@ y@@ n@@ man ?
and he is an absolute ren@@ e@@ ga@@ de and a vi@@ sion@@ ary , and he is the reason that i now live and work there .
i didn &apos;t know what those things meant , neither did di@@ ck -- neither did sy@@ d@@ ney for that matter .
sometimes i used to walk more at night .
how do we t@@ ack@@ le things like mobi@@ lity ?
and i got my daughter &apos;s bar@@ bie dol@@ l dish , i put it right where a bunch of car@@ p@@ enter ants were making de@@ br@@ is fiel@@ ds , every day , in my house , and the ants were attra@@ cted to the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , because there &apos;s no spor@@ es .
but you &apos;re the first one who &apos;s ever come back and told us what you did .
now idea cre@@ ators , they come from all wal@@ ks of life .
yes , good . somebody else ? who else would like -- see i don &apos;t -- haven &apos;t seen any women &apos;s hands up .
microsoft is doing something wonderful .
i &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
these are all individual animals band@@ ing together to make this one creature .
while it is true that those things are going on , there &apos;s an africa that you don &apos;t hear about very much .
even the most de@@ stitu@@ te of men have someone they can ab@@ use -- a woman or a child .
we know the rules . you write the code . you follow the -- and you get the results . once you know the game you just , you know , you up the ante , don &apos;t you ?
okay , for example , that &apos;s pal@@ est@@ ine .
that &apos;s our tra@@ ge@@ dy .
and probably most importantly , basically everything we &apos;ve done in the seven years following the first s@@ ab@@ ba@@ tical came out of thinking of that one single year .
so that &apos;s good , but of course what we &apos;d rather is have a way to inter@@ f@@ ere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people &apos;s moral jud@@ gment .
one is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients under@@ going non@@ inv@@ a@@ sive surgery , and also the economi@@ cal and emotional bur@@ den re@@ moved from their families and communities and the society at large -- and i think also from their physi@@ cians , by the way .
and she said -- i &apos;ll never forget -- &quot; it &apos;s just not something you want to say to a mother that &apos;s having a baby for the first time . &quot;
we can do that in multiple individuals that we &apos;ve as@@ sa@@ yed too .
and you have charles bon@@ net syn@@ dro@@ me .
let &apos;s take a small se@@ gment of this , of this un@@ connected world , and call it the education market .
is it really necessary ? &quot;
when the room sm@@ elled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des toward ga@@ y men .
&quot; well , we can flip the bus over , we can have it bur@@ st into fl@@ ames , and how about someone , you know , big explosion . &quot;
this is dna in its classi@@ c double heli@@ x form .
and we can do this just by reas@@ on@@ ably acceler@@ ating exi@@ sting trends .
what determin@@ es the types and distribu@@ tions of microbes in@@ do@@ ors ?
in fact , two years ago , only 27 percent of all the thir@@ d@@ - through ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders were pas@@ sing the state standard in both english and math .
now of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collabor@@ ating -- and case in point , is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak fam@@ ously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer -- but it does mean that soli@@ tude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
or at least , they shouldn &apos;t if they &apos;re interested in re@@ producing . that -- is not the way any human being spe@@ a@@ ks cas@@ u@@ ally .
and then we have a lower biom@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and a lower biom@@ ass of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large s@@ nap@@ pers , the large grou@@ pers .
not many people like che@@ cking boxes .
fore@@ most , women are starting to ex@@ press their sexu@@ ality .
and if you go to these places , you meet people like this .
her story has a positive en@@ ding , but there are thousands of others in similar situ@@ ations who are much less fortun@@ ate .
and it &apos;s known that migr@@ ating birds , for example , get very dis@@ ori@@ ented because of these off@@ sh@@ ore plat@@ forms .
thank you .
my ro@@ om@@ mate had a single story of africa : a single story of cat@@ astro@@ p@@ he .
right , here &apos;s a re@@ condi@@ tioned coffee machine .
thank you .
so nations may live under the threat of what no@@ bel prize w@@ inner thomas sch@@ elling called the &quot; reci@@ pro@@ cal fear of surprise attack , &quot; as i don &apos;t know if my neighb@@ or is about to attack me or not -- i may never know -- so i might take the upper hand and attack first .
if we &apos;ve got them wi@@ red up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ o@@ gram , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ yful emergen@@ ce of this ear@@ liest of play scen@@ es and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
the most advanced transi@@ stors today are at 65 nan@@ ome@@ ters , and we &apos;ve seen , and i &apos;ve had the pleasure to invest in , companies that give me great confidence that we &apos;ll extend mo@@ ore &apos;s law all the way down to roughly the 10 nan@@ ome@@ ter scale .
they &apos;re a little bit radical .
so , one of the reasons it &apos;s so challenging to pre@@ p@@ are for this y@@ 2@@ k problem is , i want to argu@@ e , we have what i would call main@@ frame po@@ is@@ oning .
instead , these people drin@@ k a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the american population .
it also happens in the very real , fl@@ es@@ h and blood of academic medicine . so in 198@@ 0 , some researchers did a study on a drug called lor@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and this was an anti-@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drug , a drug that supp@@ res@@ ses ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they &apos;re quite likely to have ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , so if we give them a drug that supp@@ res@@ ses ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving .
it &apos;s also sho@@ ck@@ ingly close to the number of people who have died in the sy@@ ri@@ an civil war , which is an active civil war .
so i &apos;m going to show you a smaller simulation .
so we really wanted to take a de@@ e@@ per look at it in hop@@ es that we would find a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing .
i see the copenhagen con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
can you picture , in our life@@ times , a politi@@ cian ever going out on a platform of the kind of full-@@ form global eth@@ ic , global citi@@ zen@@ ship ?
wind power produ@@ ces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 watts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms , you need wind farms half the area of the u.@@ k .
a blind man can see that the diam@@ onds end up in his pocket .
and they &apos;ve been fac@@ ed with a lot of law@@ su@@ its , but those law@@ su@@ its are usually not won by fashion designers .
that &apos;s the bor@@ der .
this was led by ross po@@ well and tim na@@ ish .
you know , just at the beginning of this year , at the turn of the new year , new york city ma@@ yo@@ r michael blo@@ om@@ berg made a new year &apos;s resol@@ ution that he was going to learn to code in 20@@ 12 .
it can have all the charac@@ teri@@ stics of lea@@ ther because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to re@@ move , no sc@@ ars or insect &apos;s bi@@ tes , and no waste .
so o@@ vari@@ an cancer is one of those can@@ cers that most people don &apos;t know about , or at least don &apos;t pay that much attention to .
thank you .
and it was going to be a double ver@@ tical -- it was going to be 30 vin@@ tages of ch@@ ev@@ al blan@@ c , and 30 vin@@ tages of y@@ qu@@ em .
ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless most of the governments have based their whole flu poli@@ cies on building stock@@ pil@@ es of tamiflu .
if you control the code , you control the world .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ i@@ ted ho@@ o@@ ks every few feet that may stre@@ tch for 50 miles or more .
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
so i &apos;m sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this ch@@ as@@ m of happiness that we &apos;re driving our pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al conver@@ ti@@ ble straight into .
there were 1@@ 14 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
if it has this sub@@ linear scaling , the theory says we should have sig@@ mo@@ i@@ d@@ al growth .
what should i do with my life ?
and while i was doing this , i was read@@ ing the cancer literature , trying to -- again -- famili@@ ari@@ ze myself with this new medical field .
there are ther@@ mo@@ cou@@ ples on the engine -- little sens@@ ors that detect the heat when the sun@@ light stri@@ kes them .
and you can ask yourself , what happens in a knowledge economy ?
and you actually start this game in a drop of water , as a very , very small sing@@ le-@@ cell creature , and right off the bat you basically just have to live , survive , re@@ produce .
i mean , we use tiv@@ o as ver@@ b .
they &apos;ve been around a long time , have been very important to coast communities .
in pla@@ te te@@ ct@@ oni@@ c theory , we knew that if you had pl@@ ates colli@@ de , it made sense : they would cru@@ sh into one another , you would thi@@ cken the cru@@ st , you &apos;d u@@ pli@@ ft it .
i went to eg@@ y@@ pt . i went to say h@@ ello to this one eg@@ ypti@@ an guy , i went , one , two . i went for three . he wasn &apos;t into it .
in china in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it &apos;s still increasing .
a musi@@ cian who took time from his life to teach me , a s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore , a fres@@ h@@ man at sun@@ y bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o .
there was this whole fan@@ cy diplom@@ atic system , this ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation process about the future of kosovo , and the koso@@ v@@ ars weren &apos;t part of it .
they were actually putting blood inside my body .
when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; we &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s terrible , &quot; said the patient .
you might ask yourself , what &apos;s the use@@ ful@@ ness of a robot that &apos;s un@@ stable ?
because you don &apos;t need the ge@@ t-@@ to-@@ know@@ -@@ you session at that point .
and that &apos;s the deep sea , that &apos;s the environment that we consider to be among the most pri@@ st@@ ine left on earth .
what does this mean for medicine ?
again , what does it mean here ? what does this variation actually mean ? so if we are to capi@@ tali@@ ze on all of this new molecular data and person@@ alized genomi@@ c information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years , we have to be able to differ@@ enti@@ ate between the two . so how do we do this ?
so i tried to come up with a seed shape , which , upon i@@ ter@@ ation , would un@@ fold into this thing .
i don &apos;t mean to say that i want no choice , but many of these choices are quite artifi@@ cial . &quot;
one of them is , you can , just ask this simple question . this question never fa@@ ils .
because we don &apos;t consider where they came from .
and yet many dar@@ w@@ ini@@ ans are anxi@@ ous , a little un@@ easy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the dar@@ win@@ ism goes .
before that time , people are left to their own devi@@ ces .
they live in a three-@@ dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way , that way , that way or that way .
hi . so , this cha@@ p here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexi@@ cans .
so the logical evolution here is to just make a whe@@ el@@ chair with mountain bike components , which many people have done .
he didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
oh , i know when the co@@ con@@ u@@ t &apos;s about to fall .
so let me take it back to wall street .
and so they come together , they arri@@ ve together , they pick it up together and they pull together .
in li@@ qui@@ ds , they can cru@@ ise and cu@@ ddle and lin@@ k up to form molecules .
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can &apos;t all stay clu@@ ster@@ ed up like this .
but in china they look generation after generation because they remember the very embar@@ ras@@ sing period , for 100 years , when they went back@@ wards .
so we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
bri@@ tain , america , japan , south africa , the con@@ go .
so europe is not just an example now to e@@ mu@@ late ; it &apos;s an ene@@ my to fight and to resi@@ st .
but the first cause of waste is probably even bu@@ ried in our dna .
be@@ ar in mind there are two things about this .
they are still as poor as they &apos;ve ever been .
jo@@ se ant@@ oni@@ o ab@@ re@@ u is the char@@ is@@ matic fo@@ under of a you@@ th orchestra system that has transformed thousands of kids &apos; lives in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela . here he shares his amazing story and un@@ vei@@ ls a prize wish that could have a big impact in the us and beyond .
i had no idea what was going on , but stran@@ gers inter@@ ven@@ ed , kept my heart moving , be@@ ating .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
so , obviously , you cannot have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others .
the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all , greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right .
but if i take that same data , up@@ load it to de@@ co@@ de@@ me , i can look at my risk for sample type 2 diabetes .
college ended and i returned to jer@@ us@@ alem for a year .
and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue , but to go to where the other bees go .
i would defini@@ tely say that obser@@ ving vi@@ k m@@ uni@@ z &apos; &quot; cloud &quot; a couple of years ago in manhattan for sure made me happy , as well .
i visited the site many times , and everybody , kind of -- you can see this from two kilome@@ ters away ; it &apos;s an ex@@ act center of the street , and the whole notion is to engage the public , to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city .
combine this with the as@@ sumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for who@@ m every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
there are 200 million letters that go out .
that stru@@ ck a ch@@ ord , and i said , &quot; that &apos;s true . &quot;
we only have two days of water reser@@ ve .
by the way , this was always done in public .
but of course , mental ill@@ n@@ esses can kill in more direct ways as well . the most obvious example is su@@ i@@ cide .
basically , open your hearts and your minds to the child . &quot;
what it is , is a picture of the spec@@ trum of hydrogen .
in addition , if your body size , if your b@@ mi , your body mass inde@@ x , is above 30 -- if you &apos;re clini@@ cally ob@@ ese -- we also col@@ ored the d@@ ots yellow .
what &apos;s wrong with us ?
and for those of you in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a who are stru@@ ggl@@ ing with where should i be , should i move back , should i stay ?
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is large and mo@@ tion@@ less , the sun small and mobile . but it &apos;s worth re@@ call@@ ing wi@@ tt@@ gen@@ stein &apos;s re@@ mark on the subject .
which is , all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we &apos;ve lost a gene or ga@@ ined another one .
so , for a radi@@ op@@ har@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical in the u.s. -- that you &apos;ll get a unit do@@ se for 250 dollars -- when we &apos;re finished manufac@@ turing it in-@@ house , we come at a price of about two dollars .
and that way you can scale things much smaller than micro@@ chi@@ ps .
when people have these simple ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the pri@@ mary visual cortex is activ@@ ated .
and this is not an ide@@ alized version . these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being imple@@ mented , at least for public security .
so i &apos;m looking forward to seeing some games , and actually lou@@ is castle , that &apos;s him down there , last week anno@@ un@@ ced that electronic arts , one of the largest game publi@@ sher@@ s , is rele@@ as@@ ing a game in may that has a little ea@@ ster eg@@ g fe@@ ature for suppor@@ ting this type of head tra@@ cking .
there you see it &apos;s the side bal@@ con@@ ies for the pro@@ scen@@ i@@ um .
just over three years ago , i was for the first time in car@@ ac@@ as , ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , and while flying over the city , i was just ama@@ zed by the ex@@ tent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city , a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums , dra@@ ped literally all over the mountains .
i call this entire thing -- us humans as our technology , everything that we &apos;ve made , g@@ ad@@ gets in our lives -- we call that the techni@@ um . that &apos;s this world .
here &apos;s why that &apos;s a problem : the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bot@@ tle of wine home , it won &apos;t matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to .
we live in a society blo@@ ated with data , yet star@@ ved for wisdom .
it was at this point that events began to rapidly over@@ take me .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
and i came in half an hour be@@ fore@@ hand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it , and they got it b@@ ent so it &apos;s not hi@@ tting my ch@@ in .
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
i don &apos;t know . maybe they think that , u@@ h , kil@@ l@@ ers don &apos;t plan ahead ?
by 20@@ 50 , we &apos;re going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree .
the real patient often won@@ ders , where is everyone ?
he &apos;s an exper@@ t in aging . this horizon@@ tal axis is how old you are -- t@@ wel@@ ve years old , tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ four years old , se@@ vent@@ y-@@ four , nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six years old -- and this is some medical data . so , brain strength increases up to 60 , and then after 60 , it sort of goes down . kind of depres@@ sing in a way .
these archi@@ ves in jer@@ us@@ alem , they main@@ tain a card inde@@ x fi@@ le of the ear@@ liest im@@ migr@@ ants and appli@@ can@@ ts for im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion to pal@@ est@@ ine , and later israel , from 19@@ 19 to 19@@ 65 .
so what if we evolved as hun@@ ting p@@ ack animals ?
co@@ st-@@ benefit analysis .
there &apos;s a chemical filter in there that pul@@ ls the carbon di@@ o@@ xi@@ de out of the breathing gas -- so that , when it comes back to us to breathe again , it &apos;s safe to breathe again .
i , for one , was ste@@ e@@ ped in these .
because they &apos;re moving real fast , rela@@ tivity says the intern@@ al mo@@ tions go very slow .
and now i &apos;m ti@@ ghten@@ ing las@@ h@@ es , sha@@ ped in hi@@ de as if around a ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge , sha@@ ped like five bo@@ w@@ str@@ ings .
it &apos;s like , there was no es@@ ca@@ pe from this man &apos;s death gri@@ p , but he got me saf@@ ely there .
your friends have more friends than you do , and this is known as the friend@@ ship para@@ do@@ x .
it &apos;s sol@@ vable , not by being a demo@@ cr@@ at , not by being a republi@@ can .
i found it in a book , &apos; film threat video gui@@ de : the 20 underground fil@@ ms you must see . &apos; &quot; oh , ok . so the next person@@ s says , &quot; clean it up . &quot;
when you look at the new york times , you look at other eli@@ te media , what you largely get are pictures of very weal@@ thy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
i was using these me@@ tal she@@ ars until i sto@@ le a pair from the office that i worked at .
bar@@ e@@ foot technology : this was 198@@ 6 -- no engineer , no archite@@ ct thought of it -- but we are colle@@ cting rain@@ water from the ro@@ o@@ fs .
or , how can you further ser@@ ve the greater good ?
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
or we can zo@@ om out to the table of cont@@ ents , and the video keeps playing .
now , i was offi@@ cially fre@@ aking out .
&quot; in tier@@ r@@ o del fu@@ e@@ go a native tou@@ ched with his finger some cold pres@@ er@@ ved meat while i was eating ...
and at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths .
one of the last 10,000 years and the other , certainly of the last 25 years , that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems : lu@@ st , roman@@ tic love and deep atta@@ ch@@ ment to a partner .
one is : why isn &apos;t it happening now ?
this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the de@@ ce@@ ased , and this is the transition from rel@@ ating to the de@@ ce@@ ased as a person who &apos;s living to rel@@ ating to the de@@ ce@@ ased as a person who &apos;s an ance@@ stor .
and how many would be op@@ posed ? how many would -- so the maj@@ ority here are op@@ posed , but a si@@ z@@ able min@@ ority are in fa@@ vor .
it activ@@ ates what &apos;s called the bu@@ z@@ zing bridge , or the dog .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages .
but still , if you &apos;re going to speak about a musli@@ m culture , this has a core , the di@@ vine message , which began the religion , but then many tradi@@ tions , per@@ cep@@ tions , many practi@@ ces were ad@@ ded on top of it .
but ab@@ ra@@ ham lincoln was ele@@ cted president , and then he passed the e@@ man@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion , and now they &apos;re free .
they put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets in@@ su@@ lin out in a controlled fashion , and actually cur@@ es type 1 diabetes .
the next thing is : what about the footprint ? ste@@ wart men@@ tioned the footprint .
obviously opening up the data is one , but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and cu@@ rate -- lots more partici@@ pat@@ ory opportunities .
i don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
so this whole inter@@ action with self and identi@@ ty was a very difficult one for me growing up .
the experiment was with people .
most of the biom@@ ass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this .
and symbo@@ li@@ cally , the colors of the inter@@ ior are green and yellow .
and my experience is that , when i &apos;m talking to her , with every second that pas@@ ses during our conversation , the feeling of love that bin@@ ds us is bringing us clo@@ ser and clo@@ ser together .
and it turned out that they don &apos;t know themselves .
this big cortex , or whatever , we &apos;re pretty proud of ourselves .
i &apos;m not at all against education .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally com@@ mitted to being the heal@@ er of the world .
and we don &apos;t have dis@@ pos@@ able people either .
so that didn &apos;t go over so well .
it &apos;s a ne@@ cker cu@@ be .
or maybe st@@ u just needs another back@@ up sing@@ er ?
and afterwards , we all went back to our classrooms and we dre@@ w our own ren@@ di@@ tions of his main character , ro@@ tten r@@ al@@ ph .
what can we do about this ? what are the solutions ?
that under@@ gir@@ ds most of our par@@ ent@@ ing sty@@ les , our mana@@ ging sty@@ les , the way that we mo@@ tiv@@ ate our behavior .
don &apos;t get me wrong , i don &apos;t mind playing bad guys .
and they &apos;re out there !
one of the questions from the audience is , with fra@@ cking and the natural gas process , what about the problem of me@@ than@@ e lea@@ king from that , me@@ than@@ e being a worse global warming gas than co2 ?
if we are to shift paradig@@ ms , if we are to make break@@ through@@ s , if we are to destroy my@@ ths , we need to create an environment in which exper@@ t ideas are bat@@ t@@ ling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , diver@@ se , disc@@ ord@@ ant , her@@ e@@ tical views into the discussion , fe@@ ar@@ less@@ ly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the cre@@ ation of ideas , but also from their destru@@ ction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surro@@ unding ourselves by diver@@ gen@@ t , disc@@ ord@@ ant , her@@ e@@ tical views .
we have opportunities in soli@@ d min@@ er@@ als . we have a lot of min@@ er@@ als that no one has even invest@@ ed in or expl@@ ored . and we realized that without the pro@@ per le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation to make that possible , that wouldn &apos;t happen . so we &apos;ve now got a mining code that is compar@@ able with some of the best in the world .
like everyone else , we grew mai@@ ze .
but then some of us gener@@ alized it further . and then it did !
i said , &quot; what happened ? &quot;
well done , well done .
okay , that &apos;s good . how about up a little bit ?
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , &quot; yes , you are corre@@ ct .
be@@ ars play .
we &apos;re sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ cing a lot of that , and i think in doing so , moving towards those things , we &apos;re losing something valuable .
it &apos;s for coo@@ ked food .
and so we &apos;d buy the date , and we &apos;d go home .
cause you &apos;re either a victi@@ m , or on top , like me .
and everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
do you know where your parents went to high school ?
let &apos;s think of something else .
so , i tell young people everywhere , it ain &apos;t where you start in life , it &apos;s what you do with life that determin@@ es where you end up in life , and you are bl@@ essed to be living in a country that , no matter where you start , you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself , you believe in the society and the country , and you believe that you can self-@@ improve and edu@@ cate yourself as you go along .
all the same , what &apos;s different ?
this is new ; this is traditional .
so he will get a return fa@@ vor at some point in the future .
i guess we in the one campaig@@ n would love you to be con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous , spread it , share it , pass it on .
and it &apos;s appar@@ ently okay to mar@@ ry a boy from geor@@ gia , but not to have hair from texas .
now i don &apos;t know if this is the devi@@ l or the ange@@ l sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on television &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , but i do know that i absolutely love this image .
j@@ im@@ bo &apos;s idea was for nu@@ pedia .
and i &apos;m just saying , &quot; no way . &quot;
it &apos;s not the answer , and it &apos;s not because it &apos;s only part of the story .
there were 8@@ ,000 kinds of notes in america .
then you harv@@ est the see@@ ds -- and thank you , eric ras@@ mu@@ ssen , for your help on this -- and then you &apos;re harv@@ est@@ ing the seed garden .
it &apos;s the only interpre@@ tation that makes sense to your dama@@ ged brain .
that gets you 2@@ 50,000 dead in the sud@@ an in the last 15 months .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that r &amp; amp ; d-@@ i@@ -@@ y has moved beyond just window farms and le@@ ds into solar pan@@ els and a@@ qu@@ apo@@ ni@@ c systems .
i will support any politi@@ cian of left and right , with any hal@@ f@@ way de@@ cent m@@ eri@@ to@@ cra@@ tic idea .
you have to pick and choose . and anyone who follo@@ ws the bible is going to be pi@@ cking and choo@@ sing .
and here &apos;s what he says , roughly transl@@ ated : a man -- generi@@ c man -- a man , to be great@@ ly good , must imagine clearly .
this very basic shift in my physical ori@@ ent@@ ation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the gl@@ aci@@ er .
so i thought why not p@@ uni@@ sh myself ? i &apos;ll do japanese .
and i &apos;m not really one for the warm , fu@@ zz@@ y feeling .
or a wee@@ k@@ end in paris ?
how far you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te , what follo@@ ws from it , what are the thre@@ ats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
and what i realized when i understood this -- and if you ask joel sal@@ ati@@ n what he is , he &apos;ll tell you he &apos;s not a chi@@ cken far@@ mer , he &apos;s not a she@@ ep far@@ mer , he &apos;s not a cat@@ tle ran@@ cher ; he &apos;s a gr@@ ass far@@ mer , because gr@@ ass is really the key@@ stone species of such a system -- is that , if you think about it , this completely con@@ tradi@@ cts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads , which is that for us to get what we want , nature is di@@ mini@@ shed .
this is a fi@@ ve-@@ year-old colony . this is the nest ent@@ ran@@ ce , here &apos;s a pen@@ cil for scale .
so , i &apos;m looking at these issues of collap@@ ses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies .
as i said , this can be done with only two people , and with a minim@@ um amount of time .
when we met her three years ago , we said , &quot; what could v-@@ day do for you ? &quot;
perhaps we even think that maybe super@@ nov@@ a explo@@ sions tri@@ gger forma@@ tions of planets and stars .
i once asked the mathemati@@ cians why it was that mathemati@@ cians thought this structure was impossible when sea slu@@ gs have been doing it since the si@@ lu@@ ri@@ an age .
it &apos;s about creating with mini@@ mal means something which can not be re@@ pe@@ ated , cannot be simul@@ ated in any other sphere .
thank you .
but when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pathy .
30 million ri@@ des have been shared on car@@ po@@ ol@@ ing@@ .com .
and then everybody else would have to li@@ cen@@ se this cu@@ ff or this sle@@ eve because jo@@ e b@@ low ow@@ ns it .
and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disa@@ ster like the disa@@ ster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that &apos;s basically built on trust , was basically built for a small@@ er-@@ scale system , and we &apos;ve kind of exp@@ and@@ ed it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to oper@@ ate .
and that doesn &apos;t seem enti@@ r@@ ely fair .
wi@@ red magazine , nov@@ ember 2010 .
it &apos;s kind of a well-@@ kept secret .
this last project is also of components .
oh sorry , i dropped one .
i was very fortun@@ ate when the i@@ lo@@ ve@@ you virus came out , because the first person i received it from was an ex@@ -@@ gir@@ l@@ friend of mine .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
my god , this lifestyle that i &apos;m living is so fre@@ aking evil ! &quot;
the da@@ f-@@ 2 hormone re@@ cept@@ or is very similar to the re@@ cept@@ or for the hormone in@@ su@@ lin and ig@@ f-@@ 1 .
okay , so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like .
the stuff in green is the stuff that got ad@@ ded .
la@@ k@@ sh@@ mi pr@@ at@@ ury : the lost art of le@@ tter@@ -@@ writing
i imagine an old man cr@@ ying here , out of the sight of the over@@ se@@ er .
and so we see a mush@@ room here spo@@ ru@@ l@@ ating .
the importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible -- and there &apos;s an awful lot to learn in chimpanze@@ e society .
and he poin@@ ted up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
these are hop@@ ping micro@@ bot s@@ war@@ ms .
ma@@ sters and john@@ son : now we &apos;re moving forward to the 19@@ 50s .
and all the ship can do is to dance and pi@@ tch along with the waves .
and they can have the possibility of tran@@ scen@@ ding the cir@@ cum@@ stances under which they were born .
so like let &apos;s say even a simple act .
what if i could a@@ im sound the way i a@@ im light ?
now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not ro@@ bu@@ st to degra@@ dation .
but when you &apos;re blind , you have the t@@ ac@@ ti@@ le memory for things .
the stat@@ ue is the re@@ ference , and it conne@@ cts the identi@@ ty of le@@ on@@ ar@@ do to those three faces .
and we do this because we actually believe that sili@@ con technology today is mostly about a culture of ex@@ cess .
this is about sharing and investing in kind@@ ness .
atten@@ de@@ es at me@@ et@@ ings don &apos;t know when they &apos;ll get back to the task that they left at their des@@ k .
so we were des@@ per@@ ate .
so right now , the world can produce about 3@@ 50 million do@@ ses of flu vac@@ cine for the three stra@@ ins , and we can up that to about 1.@@ 2 billion do@@ ses if we want to target a single vari@@ ant like s@@ wine flu .
so if i zo@@ om into that picture , i can just show you what it means .
well , i was just on the edge of my se@@ at .
then , you &apos;ve got to , you know , face potential public ridi@@ cule of -- that &apos;s a cra@@ zy idea , it &apos;ll never work .
the f@@ ence -- like this con@@ ception of f@@ ence that we have it &apos;s totally back@@ ward with him .
it &apos;s this am@@ phi@@ theater right over 10@@ th a@@ ve .
instead , something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .
photo@@ journalist james nacht@@ we@@ y sees his prize wish come true , as we share his powerful photographs of x@@ dr@@ -@@ t@@ b , a dru@@ g-@@ resi@@ stant stra@@ in of tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis that &apos;s tou@@ ching off a global medical crisis . learn how to help at h@@ tt@@ p : / / ww@@ w@@ .@@ x@@ dr@@ t@@ b@@ .@@ org
and that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not africa -- that &apos;s the typical treatment in the advanced world today .
and i &apos;d been extremely interested in this notion of rand@@ om@@ ness as it produ@@ ces architectural work and as it defini@@ tely conne@@ cts to the notion of the city , an ac@@ cre@@ tional notion of the city , and that led to various ideas of organization .
far@@ ther back is there one shared with chimpanze@@ es .
and that &apos;s everywhere .
i don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; are you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot;
so our idea is to create a by@@ pass , is to use these bra@@ in-@@ machine inter@@ faces to read these signals , lar@@ ger@@ -@@ scale brain@@ stor@@ ms that con@@ tain the desire to move again , by@@ pass the le@@ sion using compu@@ ta@@ tional micro@@ engineering and send it to a new body , a whole body called an exo@@ skel@@ eton , a whole robo@@ tic suit that will become the new body of these patients .
and that &apos;s how it po@@ pul@@ ates this map .
so t , e , d is the same as f , e , d .
so , it sta@@ ys under the soil .
so , this guy comes with me .
and i hope there &apos;s someone in here from the oxford english di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary , because i want to talk to you later .
is that what en@@ ab@@ led you to synchroni@@ ze ?
and we had three conditions .
do you remember that ? geor@@ ge bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
we have no choice but to embra@@ ce that reality .
and i always wanted to go back into these mountains , to see if this could possibly be true , as indeed had been reported by the great anthropolo@@ gist , reich@@ el-@@ dol@@ mat@@ off .
right . so , he gets to e , but it &apos;s the wrong ch@@ ord .
there are six which i think explain the great diver@@ gen@@ ce .
recently we have just started a program , a sport program -- bas@@ ket@@ ball for whe@@ el@@ chair users .
and four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 3@@ 4 , and yes , the pattern continu@@ es .
and it &apos;s produced a great am@@ pu@@ tation , a s@@ hal@@ low view of human nature .
i was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pi@@ vot@@ al moment in my career , and it really c@@ em@@ ented what i wanted to do with this whole pu@@ pp@@ y-@@ training thing , the notion of how to teach pu@@ pp@@ ies in a do@@ g-@@ friend@@ ly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don &apos;t have to force them .
one of the companies i started , space ad@@ vent@@ ures , will sell you a ticket .
in that moment , i became the worst thing of all : i became a rock star with a cause .
now , if we &apos;re talking about medicine , and we &apos;re talking about heal@@ ing , i &apos;d like to quote someone who has@@ n &apos;t been quot@@ ed .
i am a writer , and i want to close by read@@ ing you a short pas@@ sage that i wrote that has to do very much with this scene .
so the point is thinking it and then doing it .
and it is an ar@@ re@@ sting fact that right across the board , in every single one of the major world fai@@ ths , compassion -- the ability to feel with the other in the way we &apos;ve been thinking about this ev@@ ening -- is not only the test of any true religi@@ o@@ sity , it is also what will bring us into the pres@@ ence of what je@@ ws , chri@@ sti@@ ans and musli@@ ms call &quot; god &quot; or the &quot; di@@ vine . &quot;
the jun@@ k food industry is really great at pres@@ sing our pleasure butt@@ ons and fig@@ uring out what &apos;s the most pleas@@ ur@@ able .
n@@ k : yeah . no not lou@@ is far@@ ra@@ k@@ h@@ an , lou@@ is ka@@ hn .
each stage is magi@@ cal because it creates the im@@ pression of something u@@ tter@@ ly new appe@@ aring almost out of nowhere in the universe .
then we are going to apply them to the other areas , like energy , ecolo@@ gy , policy law and ethi@@ cs , entrepreneur@@ ship , so that people can bring these new technologies to the world .
google &apos;s doing it too .
i remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what i thought was a genu@@ ine threat from the voices .
but because the wire is cut to the emotional cent@@ ers , he says , &quot; but how come , if it &apos;s my mother , i don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot;
and i thought , well , what is that relationship ?
for the foot@@ note pan@@ el in this work , this office instru@@ cted me to photograph their central television to@@ wer in beijing .

whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine .
in@@ corre@@ ct , above , which is what almost every swimming co@@ ach will teach you .
these men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est sc@@ ra@@ p of land .
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was roll@@ ing around , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
du@@ h .
and that &apos;s one of the reasons why arth@@ ur ander@@ sen chose to la@@ unch ac@@ cent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ ade the world that ander@@ sen &apos;s could stand for something other than accoun@@ tan@@ cy .
there is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multi@@ pl@@ ying it by itself .
ok , and most of them would not come back , but some of them would come back .
helping africa is no@@ ble .
we said , &quot; the dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot;
how did he not know -- it &apos;s what we &apos;ve all for@@ gotten -- that we &apos;re not the first ones to build .
so the expansion slo@@ ws down with time .
you can s@@ wal@@ low this completely integr@@ ated device .
this one was un@@ expected because i started the year as an agno@@ stic , and by the end of the year , i became what a friend of mine calls a rever@@ ent agno@@ stic , which i love .
imagine if all you knew about willi@@ am was the fact that he grew up in a poor village .
put it on your shirt , it ru@@ ins the shirt .
all right ? very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times .
that &apos;s the only absolute phenomenon .
it &apos;s too late to be p@@ es@@ simi@@ stic -- really too late .
but we also looked at numbers of other fil@@ ms at the time that were using faci@@ al marker tra@@ cking , and that &apos;s the idea of putting mark@@ ers on the human face and doing the same process .
that ten@@ sion reson@@ ates in the work of the photograph@@ er joel me@@ y@@ ero@@ witz , who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photograph@@ y , for cap@@ turing a moment on the street , and also for his beautiful photographs of landsc@@ apes -- of tu@@ sc@@ any , of ca@@ pe co@@ d , of light .
in fact , as you can see from this graph , from the time that the texas execu@@ tion appar@@ at@@ us got effi@@ cient in the mid@@ - to lat@@ e-@@ 199@@ 0s , there &apos;ve only been a couple of years where the number of an@@ nu@@ al execu@@ tions di@@ pped below 20 .
a message written on a sti@@ cky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms , or maybe a meeting re@@ min@@ der automatically syn@@ cs with my digital cal@@ en@@ dar -- a to-@@ do list that automatically syn@@ cs with you .
now , these are three spec@@ tra@@ grams .
you in business know that the paradig@@ m structure of our time , la@@ dies and gentle@@ men , is the network .
but i &apos;d remind you what i &apos;m talking about , i &apos;m talking about military uses of non-@@ le@@ thal weapons .
ei@@ gh@@ ty-@@ six seconds after it went into its pin@@ whe@@ el disp@@ lay , we recorded this : this is a squ@@ id , over six feet long , that is so new to science , it cannot be plac@@ ed in any known scientific family .
hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok stayed at father ke@@ ene &apos;s , and her un@@ cle agre@@ ed to let her stay there until the adop@@ tion went through .
why create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began ? &quot;
each of us , no matter what our role is in business , has some hier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y of needs in the work@@ place .
so i set up a scientific cri@@ teria as to what a sen@@ sor would have to look like in order to effectively diagno@@ se pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer .
and the journey , i believe , is a metaphor for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys .
so maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
we &apos;re going to have 1,000 cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers this year , and 10,000 next year .
when we talk about bot@@ tom@@ -up , de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized phenomen@@ a , the ant colony is the classi@@ c metaphor , because , no individual ant knows what it &apos;s doing , but colle@@ ctively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .
and there is an autom@@ atic ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gar@@ dens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a cam@@ bo@@ di@@ an temple ru@@ in , completely covered in green .
focus on what &apos;s di@@ gni@@ fied , coura@@ geous and beautiful , and it gro@@ ws . thank you .
no notes , no fl@@ ats , no shar@@ ps .
and i saw this beautiful place . i knew i wanted to come back .
some of these mush@@ rooms are very happy mush@@ rooms .

this is the w@@ inner .
in 3@@ 0-@@ some years of jump@@ ing , i never did one .
and these are two of the penguins &apos; main bre@@ eding islands .
so these young men and women learned job@@ -@@ read@@ iness and life skills through bee kee@@ ping and became produ@@ ctive citizens in the process .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s war@@ ran@@ ted .
what would it be like to look on the ex@@ pi@@ red human form with love because it &apos;s so inti@@ mately a part of who we all are ?
in 2000 , we had six billion people on the planet .
and this is how we look for them .
it &apos;s the spo@@ t@@ light on the artist that helps you to focus .
they &apos;ll play it over , and over , and over .
i am , and have been since birth , leg@@ ally blind .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken a group of teena@@ gers in , and this has worked the best .
so i wanted to work with him , but he didn &apos;t want a for@@ mer bir@@ d@@ wat@@ cher , and i ended up in cam@@ bridge , england .
transition groups in chi@@ le , transition groups in the u.s. , transition groups here , what they &apos;re doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
we need the natural world . we cannot go on destro@@ ying it at the rate we are .
should you be running marath@@ ons or doing yoga ?
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn sh@@ ell@@ ers .
all this to tell you that if my father became a for@@ ger , actually , it was almost by accident .
so the chi@@ ck@@ ens do their kind of little break@@ dance and they &apos;re pushing around the man@@ ure to get at the gru@@ bs , and in the process they &apos;re spre@@ ading the man@@ ure out .
i love my@@ th@@ ology too much .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but sing@@ ers , like frank sin@@ at@@ ra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a micro@@ phone .

econ@@ om@@ ist el@@ en@@ i gab@@ re-@@ mad@@ hin out@@ lines her ambi@@ ti@@ ous vision to found the first com@@ modi@@ ties market in ethi@@ opia . her plan would create wealth , mini@@ mi@@ ze risk for farmers and turn the world &apos;s largest reci@@ pi@@ ent of food aid into a regional food bas@@ ket .
it has to be part of the explan@@ ation .
i &apos;m interpre@@ ting it in a more contemporary man@@ ner .
and it took me exactly two months of complete fru@@ stration to realize that this vision was mi@@ spl@@ ac@@ ed , and that there was another vision su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely more important and more re@@ adi@@ ly available .
it means living up to your own full potential as a human being .
i want to talk speci@@ fi@@ cally about the ar@@ ray that you see on the top .
now i have to take off my shoes or bo@@ ots to get on an airplane !
so , one of the cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sms of this kind of approach to organization is that , you know , &quot; okay , well my real des@@ k is really mess@@ y . i don &apos;t want that mess on my computer . &quot;
there are 20 ga@@ ps where new particles should be , two of which have been filled by the pati@@ -@@ sal@@ am particles .

he &apos;s a gra@@ y area in a world that doesn &apos;t like gra@@ y areas .
we need a plan that ad@@ ds up .
so i want to leave you with one last appli@@ cation .
maybe we can do it , maybe it &apos;s possible -- who knows ?
i &apos;ve written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and i write arti@@ cles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times .
so what do i mean by that ?
my mother still lives in a co@@ w-@@ dung hu@@ t , none of my brothers are going to school , and this man told me , &quot; here , go . &quot;
everybody knows , you should absolutely not work with your spo@@ use .
it prote@@ cted china from inv@@ a@@ ders for 2@@ ,000 years .
now , over the last century , we tend to think of com@@ modi@@ ty ex@@ changes as the pur@@ view of western industri@@ alized countries , and that the re@@ ference prices for c@@ ot@@ ton , coffee , co@@ co@@ a -- products produced main@@ ly in the south -- are actually a re@@ ference price , or a price discovered in these organized com@@ modi@@ ty ex@@ changes in the north@@ ern countries .
as a parti@@ cle physi@@ cist , i study the elem@@ entary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level .
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &apos;t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
so i went back to the biology of an@@ gio@@ gene@@ sis and started thinking : could the answer to cancer be pre@@ venting an@@ gio@@ gene@@ sis , be@@ ating cancer at its own game so the can@@ cers could never become dangerous ?
and then i just thre@@ w some ty@@ po@@ graphy on it .
and &quot; tor@@ ch song tri@@ lo@@ gy &quot; was based on a play about this dra@@ g queen who essentially was looking for love .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is the r@@ hi@@ zo@@ car@@ pon geo@@ graphi@@ c@@ um , or map lichen , and this is around 3@@ ,000 years old and lives in green@@ land , which is a long way to go for some lich@@ ens .
it &apos;s a problem across the developing world , and in middle income countries too . in ja@@ mai@@ ca , for example -- look at ja@@ mai@@ can members of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent , you meet them , and they &apos;re often people who are r@@ ho@@ des sch@@ ol@@ ars , who &apos;ve studied at harvard or at prin@@ c@@ eton , and yet , you go down to down@@ town king@@ ston , and you are looking at one of the most depres@@ sing sites that you can see in any mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income country in the world : a dis@@ mal , depres@@ sing landscape of bur@@ nt and hal@@ f-@@ ab@@ and@@ oned buildings .
and we sent it to oxford , england where a group of tal@@ ented cr@@ yst@@ allo@@ gra@@ pher@@ s provi@@ ded this picture , which helped us understand exactly how this mole@@ cule is so po@@ tent for this protein target .

fs : my job ends here , and the nollywood film@@ makers really have now to work .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
the third foundation is in-@@ group / loy@@ al@@ ty .
the flight la@@ sted 12 seconds and covered 1@@ 20 feet .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lap@@ se .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
and they were sort , you know , blin@@ ding gli@@ mp@@ se of ble@@ eding obvious .
most of the time , i make po@@ sters , i post them on facebook , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
scri@@ p@@ ture , he says , &quot; tea@@ ches nothing but chari@@ ty , and we must not leave an interpre@@ tation of scri@@ p@@ ture until we have found a com@@ passionate interpre@@ tation of it . &quot;
in the u.k. , we have a strong public health message on five fru@@ it and vege@@ tables a day and how much exerci@@ se we should do -- never my best thing .
there &apos;s an a@@ er@@ ated bri@@ ck i did in li@@ mo@@ ges last year , in concepts for new cer@@ a@@ mi@@ cs in architecture .
at the time that i pro@@ posed to her that -- by the way , i would have pro@@ posed to her ; she was extraordinary -- but pro@@ posed to her that she come on .
i asked him , what was it like to actually her@@ d a thousand cat@@ tle across hundreds of miles ?
ze frank : oh . amazing .
that can &apos;t keep going on , because economic in@@ centi@@ ves and di@@ sin@@ centi@@ ves are very powerful .
a progeri@@ a cell , on the other hand , because of this to@@ xi@@ c protein called pro@@ gerin , has these lu@@ mp@@ s and bu@@ mp@@ s in it .
it &apos;s a big deal . it sounds big , it sounds important , it sounds soli@@ d . it sounds american . ball@@ sy , serious , male .
and the way it does it , is it takes its tail and it s@@ w@@ ings it one way to ya@@ w left , and it s@@ w@@ ings its other way to ya@@ w right .
and then , again , it &apos;s a spec@@ trum : when you move in this direction , you &apos;re going to lose weight , you &apos;re going to feel better and you &apos;re going to ga@@ in health .
but here instead are examples , you can already 3d-@@ print texti@@ les , which is very interesting .
you can see the sky@@ di@@ ver with the red suit , he &apos;s in a stand@@ -up position .
here &apos;s somebody you &apos;ve seen already .
so i went to google earth and learned about africa .
and if you could actually st@@ ack up that many cu@@ ps in real life , that &apos;s the size it would be .
it &apos;s not violence and war , it &apos;s not race , it &apos;s not gender , it &apos;s not mar@@ x@@ ism , it &apos;s not na@@ zi@@ sm .
perhaps you &apos;re having a moment of exist@@ enti@@ al angst .
what looks like a cloud behind the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge is actually s@@ now being blo@@ wn off the sum@@ mit .
according to this self-@@ help book , guys brains are like waff@@ les ; they keep their lives com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized in boxes .
again , you know , we stop at the water &apos;s edge .
but you also can &apos;t forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete .
and a light bulb went off , which was , first , that i didn &apos;t actually have to do the writing myself , i could find wri@@ ters .
bra@@ h da@@ da da@@ da@@ da@@ da@@ h . &quot;
i &apos;ve got a gir@@ l@@ friend who &apos;s just getting over a terrible love aff@@ air .
what i see is this one . &quot;
religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman .
we started with a seed swa@@ p , really simple stuff , and then we took an area of land , a stri@@ p on the side of our main road , which was a dog toilet , basically , and we turned it into a really lo@@ vely her@@ b garden .
and it actually worked great .
this photo was taken before the great depression in bra@@ z@@ za@@ ville , con@@ go .
turkey has two great la@@ ws that protect squ@@ at@@ ters .
so any accu@@ sations of corruption or back@@ door de@@ al@@ ings between auth@@ ori@@ ties or business would ar@@ ou@@ se a social out@@ c@@ ry or even un@@ rest .
so we really need to think about looking at teacher at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and finding ways to change the at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des so that teachers are much more open and accep@@ ting of boy cultur@@ es in their classrooms .
taking tests is stres@@ s@@ ful , but bu@@ b@@ bling in a scan@@ tr@@ on does not stop bul@@ lets from bur@@ sting .
and after doing that , they really look at each other , and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole en@@ semble in playing together .
they must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
that people on the fr@@ ing@@ es can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
but it &apos;s taken all sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders , working together -- teachers and princi@@ p@@ als on one-@@ year contra@@ cts , working over and above and beyond their contract hours without com@@ pen@@ sation .
this one &apos;s so@@ le a@@ im is to provide the very things that i think are missing .
and it actually -- so technologi@@ cally , it works .
and it &apos;s not just cat@@ er@@ ers , it &apos;s hot@@ eli@@ ers , it &apos;s re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers , it &apos;s anyone who provi@@ des services to the public or businesses .
you &apos;re going to fa@@ il , too — — because — good@@ ness , you &apos;re all che@@ er@@ y about fail@@ ing .
crowd : who@@ a !
you cannot deal with a city if it &apos;s not soci@@ ally integr@@ ated .
it comes from a david ma@@ met play , and there &apos;s two con artists in the play , and the woman is con@@ ning the man , and the man looks at the woman and says , &quot; oh , you &apos;re a bad pon@@ y , i &apos;m not going to bet on you . &quot;
academic research on inst@@ ant mes@@ sa@@ ging also shows 100 people on bud@@ dy li@@ sts , but fundam@@ entally people ch@@ at with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
no@@ pe .
so today i &apos;m going to take you on a vo@@ y@@ age to cast light on some of the out@@ d@@ ated my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds and as@@ sump@@ tions that have kept us as the true sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders in the high se@@ as in the dark .
and that &apos;s when they ran into trouble .
the idea was that we were going to find nu@@ g@@ gets or ge@@ ms of technology that come from other industri@@ es like medical ima@@ ging , the video game space , and re-@@ appropriate them .
pm : and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . b@@ v : oh , thank you .
wel@@ come to the new world .
or , look carefully at this sil@@ k sc@@ roll made by z@@ hu@@ z@@ ho@@ u in 13@@ 6@@ 8 .
hundreds of re@@ mi@@ xes came back -- lots of different attemp@@ ts .
when soldiers came across ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ bs in iraq and afghanistan , instead of putting on a bom@@ b suit and going out and po@@ king with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
and i told them i &apos;d build them an arm .
let &apos;s figure out what this is .
we need to make the world a smaller place .
there was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect .
&quot; human mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es develop a special b@@ ond , and when they &apos;re much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be na@@ ked together . &quot;
and we had put a camera in the gri@@ pper of the hand of the robot , and we wrote some special scri@@ p@@ ts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by cli@@ cking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden .
these are automatically constru@@ cted using the found objects : &quot; i think i feel a little full . &quot;
if this group can establi@@ sh standards , and if the shi@@ p@@ building industry adop@@ ts them for building new ships , we can now see a gradu@@ al decline in this potential problem .
sometimes brian and i walk through the park with sc@@ ar@@ le@@ tt , and she roll@@ s through the gr@@ ass , and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gra@@ titude .
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of qui@@ et , scre@@ aming des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ press people they don &apos;t like .
and that is a lot of water .
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people &apos;s hearts and minds ?
will it re@@ main the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
a group of 20 eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tic micro@@ biologi@@ sts published a paper two years ago ere@@ cting op@@ is@@ tho@@ kon@@ ta -- a super@@ -@@ kingdom that jo@@ ins anim@@ alia and f@@ ung@@ i together .
this is a concept dem@@ o , so i want to make that clear .
so what i &apos;d really like to suggest is that we need to sc@@ al@@ e-@@ up .
nobody bought one .
i mean , that &apos;s just not possible , you know .
i &apos;m working at a gas station on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of s@@ anta bar@@ bar@@ a , california .
i &apos;m a neuro@@ scientist , a professor at the university of california .
now , the four@@ th meaning of open@@ ness , and cor@@ respon@@ ding principle , is about em@@ power@@ ment .
they said , yes , walking the course is str@@ en@@ u@@ ous physical exerci@@ se .
he had to focus the memory -- seems ok .
i think it &apos;s the best way of veri@@ fying histori@@ cal statistics .
we &apos;re having great difficul@@ ties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
but there &apos;s always this illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without cor@@ ds .
as an archite@@ ct , i have to con@@ front something like this .
thanks for listening .
i believe in rand@@ om@@ ness , and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .
they che@@ cked sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es . they were meeting with secre@@ t@@ ari@@ es .
another concept is the digital clinical chart , which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients , but when we talk about works of art , unfortunately , it &apos;s never been ta@@ pped as an idea .
so he designed a pl@@ ot@@ ter as well , and , you know , at that point , i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine .
and so that &apos;s why that pri@@ ority has been set .
i want to use the example of my own country , called uganda , and the kind of structure of in@@ centi@@ ves that aid has brought there .
so the blind man went down on his kne@@ es , down like this , and told the man with no legs to go over his back , and stood up .
so in mar@@ ch 2010 , we signed the first social impact b@@ ond with the mini@@ stry of justice around pe@@ ter@@ bor@@ ough prison .
&quot; strange , &quot; i said .
the guy had a du@@ pli@@ cate head@@ set for me to listen to .
that &apos;s a production line and a very fast one .
but we &apos;re already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world , including this shot from under the ice in ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca .
again , the eyes and hands of a@@ val@@ o@@ ki@@ tes@@ h@@ var@@ a .
so it was about four years ago , five years ago , i was sitting on a stage in philadelphia , i think it was , with a bag similar to this .
i took libr@@ ary material that had fru@@ it in their title and i used them to make an or@@ ch@@ ard walk with these fru@@ its of knowledge .
and it was a gor@@ geous day in the african sun , and the dust was flying and the girls were dan@@ cing , and there was this house , and it said , &quot; v-@@ day safe house for the girls . &quot;
nothing is original , says kir@@ by fer@@ gu@@ son , cre@@ ator of everything is a re@@ mix . from bo@@ b dy@@ l@@ an to steve jobs , he says our most cele@@ br@@ ated cre@@ ators bor@@ row , ste@@ al and transform .
thank you .
because it could run all the time .
because you have to ch@@ u@@ ck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance .
it you slow down , you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of colli@@ sion .
and i almost bro@@ ke my leg dan@@ cing to his music .
no scientists disp@@ ute this curve , but laborat@@ ories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way .
i &apos;m sort of making this cla@@ im that there is a game la@@ yer on top of the world , and that it &apos;s very important that we build it proper@@ ly .
you touch yourself , there &apos;s a sti@@ mul@@ us that comes up those very same ner@@ ves back up to your brain .
now , before i talk more about that technology , let &apos;s have a quick look at what human charac@@ ters look like at the moment in computer games .
you try rhy@@ ming with garage !
may .
i can take these children and in 20 weeks , demon@@ strated ap@@ titude ; i can get them high school equi@@ valent .
we don &apos;t need a reason .
so they &apos;re sp@@ inning these tiny nan@@ o fi@@ bers of p@@ ure cellu@@ lose .
thank you very much .
and that those oil tan@@ kers needed to be de@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed , and 2004 was going to be the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le .
and maybe something else .
of course what we did when fac@@ ed with such ou@@ tra@@ geous hyper@@ bo@@ le ...
these are happy vo@@ c@@ ali@@ zations .
so what was once the special little side treat now is the main , much more regular .
i was asked , i guess about six years ago , to do a series of pain@@ t@@ ings that in some way would celebra@@ te the birth of pi@@ er@@ o d@@ ella franc@@ es@@ ca .
they have a series of tra@@ ps , of s@@ nar@@ es that they &apos;ve set up to catch wild pi@@ gs , s@@ na@@ kes , monkeys , ro@@ dents -- anything they can , really .
so they learned quickly and effici@@ ently .
now this is what you do , is you ben@@ d both these legs into a tri@@ angle , and you just wra@@ p some ta@@ pe around .
so we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , and of course that has enormous implications .
these hero@@ in addi@@ cts in de@@ to@@ x in pakistan re@@ minded me of fig@@ ures in a play by be@@ ck@@ et@@ t : is@@ ol@@ ated , waiting in the dark , but dra@@ wn to the light .
and one edi@@ tor told me that she wasn &apos;t interested in doing what she called &quot; manu@@ al labor stories . &quot;
i &apos;m not using any hypothe@@ tical data .
and i think for many people , that wa@@ ke@@ -up call takes the form of an ill@@ ness .
and i particularly remember a really good speech by k@@ im j@@ ong il on how to get te@@ ens smo@@ king again .
that &apos;s the sound of genetic mu@@ tations of the avi@@ an flu becoming a dead@@ ly human flu .
and we take it for gran@@ ted now , that each of these machines has billi@@ ons of transi@@ stors , doing billi@@ ons of cycles per second without fail@@ ing .
so what does it mean when people &apos;s identi@@ ty is mobile ?
and so the material can as@@ sume a lot of for@@ mat@@ s .
these were the first cl@@ oned cal@@ ves , the first cl@@ oned gre@@ y wol@@ ves , and then , finally , the first cl@@ oned pi@@ g@@ lets : alex@@ is , chi@@ sta , car@@ re@@ l , j@@ ani@@ e and dot@@ com .
as pla@@ to said , what space is to size , time is to value .
&quot; two sticks , &quot; you can go with it . thanks .
a lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degra@@ dation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depres@@ sing .
your moment of happiness reve@@ als that reality , that reali@@ zation , that recogni@@ tion : &quot; maybe i am the whole .
and there is probably a better way to do this .
everything &apos;s a con@@ tradi@@ ction .
we thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
that report , in fact , which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo@@ -@@ engineering .
so i wasn &apos;t going to tell her about this idea , but the next day i couldn &apos;t control myself , i told her .
a message to the enter@@ tain@@ ment industry and to the press : on the whole , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job fighting sti@@ g@@ ma and pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce of many kinds .
but as social scientists , we continue to ask about possible alterna@@ tives .
it is the mother of all markets . you remember that internet ?
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
they send him to iraq .
you &apos;ve just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that &apos;s happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
lu@@ ck@@ ily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .
you will never an@@ ni@@ hi@@ late the ger@@ ms .
and she thought , &quot; he will never go there . &quot;
and instead , they &apos;ll be plan@@ ning for the future and starting to build the 2@@ 2@@ nd century en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
when i came home in 195@@ 5 from university at the time of martin luther king , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents .
let &apos;s just break this shelf . okay , that shelf bro@@ ke .
it &apos;s why we think gar@@ bage men might be paid more than people who work in par@@ ks , ok ?
and she does really good business . in fact , i wat@@ ched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dres@@ ses .
and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it back . i &apos;m happy without it . &quot; go@@ sh .
you ever thought about that ?
one of the fo@@ under@@ s went to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , saw it imple@@ mented some@@ place , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool .
and there we are , not just last in the e@@ .@@ u@@ . , we &apos;re last in europe , at the very bottom .
and so we said , well , what would the monkeys spon@@ tane@@ ously do if this was really their cur@@ ren@@ cy , if they were really using it like money ?
i have a bunch of other inven@@ tions .
and at a million dollars each , that would be about 12 billion dollars .
and i say , it &apos;s appropriate for us to ask the question , who are we being as we go back out into the world ?
and they are giving a voice to themselves .
people don &apos;t have the time or the pati@@ ence to wait for me to fo@@ ol around with the co@@ des for every word or p@@ hrase .
i am bill g@@ ates and i write the code .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
so david and i appli@@ ed to this program and created a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um at us@@ c where we &apos;ve got some of the best on@@ colo@@ gi@@ sts in the world and some of the best biologi@@ sts in the world , from cold spring har@@ b@@ or , stanford , au@@ stin -- i won &apos;t even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a model of cancer like this .
that changes our climate .
here is this mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or challenging the israeli@@ tes to one-@@ on-@@ one comb@@ at .
these systems are really hard to build , but we &apos;re just starting to be able to get there , and so , watch out .
it &apos;s a disorder that beg@@ ins much pri@@ or to the time that the child is born .
the waves were 25 to 50 feet high .
the second stage that we &apos;re in now is the idea of lin@@ king pages .
i will craft my own dr@@ um .
it &apos;s the first version of the time machine .
di@@ mi@@ tr@@ i : come on , mil@@ o . you know what parents are like .
it &apos;s easy to ben@@ d .
but the cool part is the user interface .
the first thing i began to notice : how many big concepts were emerging -- from the wisdom of crow@@ ds to smart mo@@ bs -- around how ridicul@@ ously easy it is to form groups for a purpose .
thank you .
which means that we are now in a position where we have redu@@ ced traffic across this toll cor@@ don with 20 percent , and redu@@ ced con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on by enormous numbers , and people aren &apos;t even aware that they have changed , and they hon@@ est@@ ly believe that they have li@@ ked this all along .
... help us find children who can participa@@ te in project prak@@ ash . ) ps : so , as i zo@@ om in to the eyes of this child , you will see the cause of his blin@@ d@@ ness .
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
oh , my good@@ ness . he &apos;s just too good .
it is the place where we &apos;re learning the most .
it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad phenomenon throughout south asia , including the mal@@ di@@ ves .
interest@@ ingly , data is relationships .
if you don &apos;t like the hot@@ el , there &apos;s a castle down the road that you can r@@ ent for 5,000 dollars a night .
if the rule of law is sound , it prote@@ cts the poor and it prote@@ cts the vulnerable .
we might think that those younger than us , those who are born into this , will ada@@ pt more natur@@ ally .
this is a picture of a prototy@@ pe for part of the c@@ p@@ u which is in the science museum .
okay ? we never would have found those with our ob@@ session with what &apos;s tren@@ ding now .
and he &apos;s sen@@ sing the tex@@ ture by recei@@ ving an electri@@ cal message directly in the brain .
if we see someone in a whe@@ el@@ chair , we as@@ sume they cannot walk .
which leads us to conclu@@ de american businesses fa@@ il faster than americans , and therefore american businesses are evol@@ ving faster than americans .
thank you very much .
and it &apos;s been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone .
thank you .
thank you very much .
in the mean@@ while , the patient &apos;s on the oper@@ ating room table .
so we don &apos;t really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make opti@@ mal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take .
well , that just ended communication .
i would never have been that ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous before i started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
we &apos;re seeing that now in the hor@@ n of africa where food prices are up 2@@ 40 percent in some areas over last year .
now , some of them you &apos;ve got to make up , people .
but despite its very small weight , enough of it is e@@ mitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
and he &apos;d show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand , which is that when we give in the world what we want the most , we he@@ al the broken part inside each of us .
i had no idea .
in 2008 , conser@@ van@@ cy gener@@ ated 5@@ .@@ 7 million dollars .
they text and shop and go on facebook during classes , during present@@ ations , actually during all me@@ et@@ ings .
his department stores confi@@ sc@@ ated , he spent the rest of his life in a rel@@ ent@@ less pur@@ suit of art and culture .
is a bad fee@@ der lot operation for be@@ ef better or worse than a bad gra@@ zing operation for be@@ ef ?
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 4@@ 1 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of her@@ s , if it doesn &apos;t ble@@ ed when you cut it , my da@@ d@@ dy doesn &apos;t understand it .
but look at the arro@@ ws .
open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
so nature already gives us really ex@@ qui@@ site structures on the nan@@ o@@ scale .
i watch it s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing the paper ce@@ as@@ el@@ ess@@ ly , in@@ tent as any for@@ a@@ ger that has nothing on its mind but the gru@@ bs and insects that will allow it to live another day .
and the third is com@@ mit@@ ment .
he said , &quot; gre@@ g , there &apos;s two things i &apos;d like you to do .
now , are there down@@ si@@ des to that ?
i am an emotional creature .
do you remember writing that chapter ?
there would be no stable shor@@ eline .
today , stories continue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ ders .
it &apos;s not nice to give them emplo@@ y@@ ment in our fac@@ t@@ ories , our companies .
give teachers scri@@ p@@ ts to follow in the classroom , so even if they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing and don &apos;t care about the wel@@ f@@ are of our kids , as long as they follow the scri@@ p@@ ts , our kids will get edu@@ cated .
and then we did one more of these .
so there &apos;s a str@@ and that goes like this , goes along one heli@@ x and bin@@ ds -- it jump@@ s to another heli@@ x and comes back .
so , that &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate .
and for parkinson &apos;s disease , co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , these have indeed been able to bring some kind of re@@ me@@ dy to people with certain kinds of disorder .
and so this has rais@@ ed a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues .
that &apos;s the sun at that end .
and when ki@@ ba@@ ki got into power -- through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in ken@@ ya -- they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
there were some sites where one percent of all the skul@@ ls have these holes , and so you can see that neuro@@ logi@@ c and psychi@@ at@@ ri@@ c disease is quite common , and it was also quite common about 7@@ ,000 years ago .
and so what i want you to remember from this talk are three things .
and that day , north korea , that very day , north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan -- -- and land it before ...
to give you some perspective , in the previ@@ ous two decades of sear@@ ching , we had only known about 400 pri@@ or to ke@@ pler .
sm : so you know what &apos;s happened ?
so each sample gets us about 50,000 data points with re@@ pe@@ at meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , a thousand sam@@ ples .
the pur@@ ch@@ as@@ er would send the admini@@ stra@@ tive offi@@ cer some dollars digi@@ t@@ ally , and the ven@@ d@@ or would sell the stol@@ en credit card details .
and i &apos;m being told the dynami@@ c .
rather than spending their lives eating gr@@ ass , for which their st@@ om@@ ach@@ s were designed , they were for@@ ced to eat so@@ y and corn .
i was very ea@@ ger to be useful in the world -- i think we all have that feeling .
and the next generation fi@@ ber will be simply magic .
the rest will grow older and get two billion children .
and you take the piece out into the da@@ y@@ light .
and the boys get bigger , and the rock@@ ets get bigger .
a normal lung is all sort of dark and black here .
suppose i were talking with you and i was introdu@@ cing you to my un@@ cle .
yes ? good ?
the nur@@ ses , an@@ esthe@@ si@@ olo@@ gist , the surgeon , all the assi@@ stan@@ ts are waiting around .
ger@@ many is on the left . and au@@ stri@@ a is on the right .
no , it &apos;s worse than that .
but they agre@@ ed to go along with it for a while .
because if i can get that right , i can make them wonderful , and i can make them re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly wonderful .
we squ@@ ash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost atta@@ ched to this .
he said , &quot; well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot;
how do you pick up a mali@@ ci@@ ous online virus , the kind of mal@@ ware that s@@ no@@ ops on your data and ta@@ ps your bank accoun@@ t ? often , it &apos;s through simple things you do each day without thinking twice . james ly@@ ne re@@ minds us that it &apos;s not only the n@@ sa that &apos;s watching us , but ever@@ -@@ mor@@ e-@@ sophi@@ sti@@ cated cyber@@ cri@@ min@@ als , who explo@@ it both weak code and tru@@ sting human nature .
they even put a reci@@ pe up on the wall , until they were told this was illegal .
i guess i &apos;m just going to cas@@ u@@ ally tell you the types of things that i think about with this .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
the final movement is called mo@@ unds .
world peace .
and with just a little bit of plan@@ ning , we could transform a space dom@@ inated by traffic into one that provi@@ des open space for people , re@@ conne@@ cts people with food and trans@@ forms waste into clo@@ sed loo@@ p opportunities .
and he rema@@ ined there until 1.@@ 6 million years later , when this very famous fossi@@ l h@@ unter , kam@@ o@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small hi@@ ll@@ side and found that small piece of his skul@@ l lying on the surface am@@ on@@ gst the pe@@ bb@@ les , recogni@@ zed it as being hom@@ in@@ id .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing at the red@@ wood neuro@@ science institute .
so that &apos;s what we are building from the left side of the river .
and the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass , and it was only one percent of the weight of dou@@ ble@@ -@@ gla@@ zing .
so when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box somewhere .
they said , &quot; why don &apos;t we have these things ? &quot;
it &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
and it &apos;s dest@@ ined to collap@@ se for many reasons -- kind of mal@@ th@@ usi@@ an reasons -- that you run out of resources .
this means we all benefit when another country gets rich .
i suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world , and it wasn &apos;t happening later , it was happening now .
over the years , many people and news repor@@ ts have bl@@ amed the person@@ nel in the institutions for the har@@ m caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is car@@ ing for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
stage two is mix@@ ing . we take the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents and we mix them .
there is a practice called female cir@@ cum@@ ci@@ sion .
yeah ? all right , all right . i have only a few .
and i myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
a mamm@@ ali@@ an fe@@ tu@@ s , if it lo@@ ses a limb during the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy , will re-@@ grow that limb .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest my@@ ths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical break@@ through@@ s and then all of our problems will be sol@@ ved .
like a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e . because he represents the u.@@ n .
am i hearing a few &quot; sorry &apos;s &quot; ? i think i &apos;m hearing a few sorry &apos;s .
thank you .
and then i &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
i &apos;m going to cut some v@@ eins , ar@@ ter@@ ies .
would you tie those two str@@ ings together ? &quot;
find it . make sure it doesn &apos;t join the list . &quot;
it has also given us this , the ability to look at the world from the outside .
r@@ m : thank you .
i talked with over 200 women . i talked to older women , younger women , married women , les@@ bi@@ ans , single women ; i talked to corpo@@ rate profession@@ als , college profess@@ ors , ac@@ tors , sex workers ; i talked to afri@@ can@@ -@@ american women , asi@@ an-@@ american women , na@@ tiv@@ e-@@ american women , cau@@ ca@@ si@@ an women , je@@ wish women .
you &apos;re going to place this in an o@@ ven@@ -like device .
so as your model is close to reality , and it conver@@ ges with feelings , you often don &apos;t know it &apos;s there .
if you put electricity on them , they e@@ mit light .
it &apos;s these sort of personal stories . you know , you read the blogs about politics , or about media , and go@@ ssi@@ p and all these things .
a million properties have been returned .
i can &apos;t say whether li@@ thi@@ um works in all als patients , but i can say whether it works in hum@@ ber@@ to .
they &apos;re en@@ danger@@ ed because we &apos;re moving towards social net@@ working .
imm@@ uni@@ zation , that &apos;s the che@@ ap@@ est way to save a child &apos;s life .
di@@ an@@ e do@@ w@@ ns : at night when i close my eyes , i can see chri@@ sti@@ e re@@ aching her hand out to me while i &apos;m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
every single browser ta@@ b gives you a different type of time .
it cle@@ ars the forest , reve@@ als the trees inside .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um cool@@ ing load by a third .
and then you have hearing and smell , which has the through@@ put of a hard dis@@ k .
so the solutions are just fix@@ ing these three issues .
if -- in china , in the year 199@@ 8 , 4@@ 17 million people used bi@@ cycles ; 1.@@ 7 million people used cars .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of inde@@ li@@ bly sc@@ ar your minds with these char@@ is@@ matic and ma@@ je@@ stic creatures .
i spent the best part of last year working on a docum@@ entary about my own happiness -- trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way , like i can train my body , so i can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-@@ being .
t@@ k : so it was a little slow ?
so it comes to the site twice a year .
and ty@@ po@@ graphy &apos;s a very important part of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um and we encoura@@ ge our students to look in@@ ward for influ@@ ence .
like this green one , this is a painting i did about 10 years ago , but it has some -- see , in the upper third -- there are these mo@@ ir@@ es and inter@@ ference patterns that are radio kind of ima@@ gery .
now , by the time we get out here to , let &apos;s say , ac@@ ute bee paral@@ ysi@@ s virus -- probably a bad one to have if you &apos;re a bee -@@ -- this virus shares almost no simi@@ l@@ ari@@ ty to co@@ x@@ sa@@ cki@@ evi@@ rus , but i can gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee you that the sequ@@ ences that are most conser@@ ved among these viruses on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here .
fa@@ st-@@ forward , 2004 : in the peak of our ac@@ tivi@@ sm , the minister of gender li@@ beri@@ a called me and said , &quot; le@@ y@@ ma@@ h , i have a nin@@ e-@@ year-old for you .
oh , sorry .
and alb@@ ani@@ a and t@@ uni@@ sia .
thank you .
and when the doctor beg@@ ins the visit , she knows hei@@ ght , weight , is there food at home , is the family living in a shel@@ ter .
they are believed to have magi@@ cal powers .
there needs to be some kind of spr@@ ing-@@ loaded mechan@@ ism in order to generate the amount of force that we obser@@ ve , and the speed that we obser@@ ve , and the out@@ put of the system .
they &apos;re in the crowd , and the crowd is swi@@ t@@ ching on lights , and we can see them for the first time , not as an un@@ differ@@ enti@@ ated mass of stran@@ gers , but as individuals we can learn from .
so , she had to go to meeting after meeting , same arguments made over and over again .
you know , as i look around the world i see a lot of ga@@ ps , and i think we all see a lot of ga@@ ps .
right , so here you want -- entrepreneurs by definition are people who are lea@@ ving something else , starting a new world over here , creating and putting their life@@ blood into this kind of thing .
and then the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e comes through , and the house is in much better condi@@ tion than it would normally have been in .
and it was a war@@ ning -- don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business , or you &apos;re going to get stuck .
our modern society has a special relationship with gps .
now the history that we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed is that we &apos;ve gro@@ wn at 2.@@ 0 percent per year over the whole period , 18@@ 9@@ 1 to 2007 , and remember it &apos;s been a little bit negative since 2007 .
a@@ g : there are technical implications certainly .
they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot;
but it is a politics of principle , not of parti@@ s@@ ans@@ hi@@ p .
people were tra@@ cking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; dia@@ pers on their iphone .
but before i di@@ ve into those i want to ad@@ mit that i am an opti@@ m@@ ist .
so if you drive for three hours , you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes , because that &apos;s normally what people will stop for .
i &apos;m going to talk about those looking for great jobs , great care@@ ers , and why you &apos;re going to , why you &apos;re going to fa@@ il .
de@@ wor@@ ming .
we fund pro@@ state cancer foun@@ da@@ tions now in 13 countries .
and from what i heard from our new president , i &apos;m very optimi@@ stic . thank you .
it took me four years longer than my pe@@ ers , and i convin@@ ced someone , my ange@@ l ad@@ vi@@ sor , su@@ san fi@@ s@@ ke , to take me on , and so i ended up at prin@@ c@@ eton , and i was like , i am not supposed to be here .
second offi@@ cial : i don &apos;t even know the place called &#91; unclear &#93; .
i just formed a bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ nolo@@ gy company that is using this sort of an approach to develop thera@@ pe@@ u@@ tics for alzheimer &apos;s and other diseases of aging , and we &apos;re making some real progress .
and it &apos;s a story in which humans play an ast@@ oni@@ shing and creative role .
never before have we in the west been so sc@@ ru@@ t@@ ini@@ zed .
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speak@@ ers in the last few days .
dna analysis , one of the hall@@ mar@@ ks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of bones actually belon@@ ged to the person who read all those astron@@ omi@@ cal books which were filled with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver hair that was cop@@ erni@@ c@@ us &apos; hair -- obviously not many other people bo@@ ther@@ ed to read these books later on .
j@@ as@@ on started at dar@@ pa on mar@@ ch 18@@ th , 2010 .
it is , shor@@ tly , going to think it &apos;s got the u@@ gli@@ est tasmani@@ an devi@@ l baby in the world , so maybe it &apos;ll need some help to keep it going .
larger by 17 percent than every termin@@ al put together at hea@@ throw -- built -- plus the new , un@@ -@@ built termin@@ al five .
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choo@@ sing off@@ spring that looked a particular way and then bre@@ eding them .
we pay a price for that , but we are aware of it , and generally we will pay the price for increased fre@@ ed@@ oms , choices and opportunities .
and he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
it &apos;s not so simple .
it &apos;s a sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ary and re@@ ads from left to right .
i want to give what &apos;s very nearly the last word to ines .
the second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it open@@ ed this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to ser@@ ve the world to make it better .
we need to ask some of the ce@@ os whether they were involved in this mes@@ cal@@ ine experiment .
and i &apos;m just standing there , watching this scene with a complete dis@@ belief , not knowing what to do .
i had met a group of children in the c@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an island of sa@@ int kit@@ ts , and i did work and play with them .
i was looking for some kind of form , and in the end , i made 100 bu@@ tter@@ -@@ fri@@ es . do you get it ?
i thought it was all graphi@@ cs -- so here it is in rever@@ se .
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
now , let me be clear about what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every con@@ cei@@ vable moral question .
for this fish , it &apos;s actually whole cells with nu@@ cle@@ i and mem@@ bran@@ es .
and look at this whole range of cy@@ cle@@ -@@ based innova@@ tions : cycle that &apos;s a spra@@ yer , cycle that gener@@ ates energy from the sho@@ cks on the road .
now , syn@@ esthe@@ sia is the experience of a sti@@ mul@@ us in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as col@@ ored hearing .
and what if we go back beyond that single ance@@ stor , when there was pres@@ um@@ ably a competi@@ tion among many languages ?
they are all holding books .
from the archi@@ ves : the le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y graphic designer mil@@ ton glas@@ er di@@ ves deep into a new painting inspired by pi@@ er@@ o d@@ ella franc@@ es@@ ca . from here , he mu@@ ses on what makes a convin@@ cing poster , by brea@@ king down an idea and making it new .
but you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , she &apos;s good at some things -- but if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s dealing with people on the phone , she &apos;s talking to the kids , she &apos;s painting the cei@@ ling , she &apos;s doing open-@@ heart surgery over here .
this was in an area called wel@@ la@@ wat@@ ta , a prime resi@@ denti@@ al area in col@@ om@@ bo .
and lu@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; at the north po@@ le , there is always s@@ now .
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
we would see a sha@@ do@@ w of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the mi@@ lk@@ y way galaxy and its lu@@ min@@ ous dust lan@@ es .
and so i hon@@ est@@ ly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marri@@ ages , that time is now .
because people at the top of the cha@@ in , people like you , i think , are starting to realize that there &apos;s too much speed in the system , there &apos;s too much bu@@ sy@@ ness , and it &apos;s time to find , or get back to that lost art of shi@@ fting ge@@ ars .
in any case , the cameras shoot roughly every hour .
and these cameras are posi@@ tioned on ro@@ cks on the si@@ des of the gl@@ aci@@ ers , and they look in on the gl@@ aci@@ er from per@@ man@@ ent , bedro@@ ck posi@@ tions , and they watch the evolution of the landscape .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
but not every transition is possible . and this shows how it works .
they studied those da@@ y@@ care cent@@ ers at the time of highest ten@@ sion , which is pi@@ ck@@ -up time .
now , this may surprise you , but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question .
my children usually tell me that one of those pas@@ sions is a little more appar@@ ent than the other .
now they are 98 percent , and it , i think , shows human dom@@ ination of the earth .
mi@@ ll .
she &apos;s prepar@@ ed to clean te@@ eth , but when she gets there , she fin@@ ds out that there are no doctors , no denti@@ sts , and the clin@@ ic is just a hu@@ t full of flies .
how we build things can change as well .
our battery can hand@@ le the very high temper@@ ature ri@@ ses that come from current sur@@ ges .
&quot; the generation that lived at the top of the mountain , that parti@@ ed so hard , and so ab@@ used its inher@@ it@@ ance . &quot;
wow .
you see the skel@@ et@@ al structure of it .
i think we need to sing for our tea .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analo@@ g@@ ous to what we do to the word &quot; compassion &quot; in our culture -- we clean it up and we di@@ min@@ ish its dep@@ ths and its gro@@ unding in life , which is mess@@ y .
haiti is also dark , compar@@ ed to its neighb@@ or here , the dom@@ ini@@ can re@@ public , which has about the same number of resi@@ dents .
i just want to say it was sort of a rule of th@@ um@@ b though , there &apos;s about two or three fire hy@@ dr@@ ants on every city block .
and that was just a small per@@ cent@@ age of the dead .
&quot; why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
would they wonder who i was , i thought .
we take the sc@@ aff@@ old , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve le@@ af@@ lets opening and clo@@ sing .
i need to have a health care lexi@@ con .
and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they &apos;re par@@ ked to generate electricity for the gri@@ d .
it &apos;s an illusion , like sun@@ sets .
and when you &apos;re dealing with gram@@ ma@@ r , which is , you know , incredibly dr@@ y , e@@ .b. white wrote such wonderful , wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal -- and actually , str@@ unk -- and then you come to the rules and , you know , there are lots of gram@@ ma@@ r things . &quot; do you mind me asking a question ?
so books , music , video , software . there &apos;s only 50,000 ti@@ tles of it .
often , the good ideas are so star@@ ing-@@ at@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ ri@@ ght-@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ face that you kind of miss them . and i think , a lot of times , what we do is just , sort of , hold the mi@@ r@@ ror up to our clients , and sort of go , &quot; du@@ h ! you know , look what &apos;s really going on . &quot;
the meat is tor@@ n up .
h@@ ence , we need a stance of proble@@ m-@@ fix@@ ing , not just proble@@ m-@@ a@@ vo@@ i@@ dance .
well , from the coal bur@@ ned at the power plant through all these com@@ po@@ unding los@@ ses , only a t@@ ent@@ h of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pi@@ pe as flow .
you know there are two models of quality as@@ surance in cat@@ ering .
i think it &apos;s important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i &apos;ve done that .
this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .
but it &apos;s going to have a big impact because we &apos;re going to have ni@@ che drugs .
imagine if you could record your life -- everything you said , everything you did , available in a perfect memory store at your finger@@ ti@@ ps , so you could go back and find memor@@ able moments and re@@ live them , or si@@ ft through tra@@ ces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previ@@ ously had gone un@@ discovered .
the first actor is the security coun@@ cil .
but that can &apos;t be what made the difference .
that &apos;s the second half of cognitive sur@@ plus .
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
they come in a lot of different shapes .
it &apos;s libr@@ ari@@ es .
i was like , &quot; yes ? &quot;
so there &apos;s a few elements , mostly social poli@@ cies and some elements of the software .
that &apos;s very cool .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
well , it en@@ ables you to drin@@ k coffee .
wow , that &apos;s interesting .
and my idea was to make the space tan@@ gi@@ ble .
the other thing i felt was that arm@@ re@@ sts had never really been proper@@ ly appro@@ ached from the stand@@ point of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
and yet , on the other hand , if i didn &apos;t feel this compassion , then i feel that it would be time for me to hang up my ro@@ be and give up being a rab@@ bi .
this picture shows a pat@@ ch of sky so small that it would take about 100 pat@@ ches like it to cover the full moon in the sky .
there &apos;s very little economi@@ es of scale .
this is my wife and collabor@@ ator , rup@@ al .
and that was the dep@@ loy@@ ment of the hu@@ y@@ gens probe , the europe@@ an-@@ built hu@@ y@@ gens probe that cas@@ sin@@ i had car@@ ried for seven years across the solar system . we dep@@ lo@@ yed it to the atmosphere of titan , it took two and a half hours to des@@ c@@ end , and it land@@ ed on the surface .
and just to sample the kind of inter@@ ven@@ tions that we find have an effect , when we teach people about the pleas@@ ant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your as@@ sign@@ ments is to take the min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness skills , the sa@@ vor@@ ing skills , and you &apos;re as@@ signed to design a beautiful day .
you will understand nothing with my type of english .
as i said , all that was in service of creating a flexible yet aff@@ ord@@ able con@@ figu@@ ration .
these different mi@@ ce are different mu@@ tations that re@@ capi@@ tu@@ late different kinds of blin@@ d@@ ness that affect humans .
clearly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work .
i saw my own intern@@ ist last week , and he said to me , &quot; you know , &quot; and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free , but i paid him for the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , which is that i need to lose some weight .
previ@@ ous to this time , i was very sel@@ fish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous .
can we get those areas of the brain to use gl@@ u@@ co@@ se once again ?
and of course , it &apos;s made ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely for ted 20@@ 12 .
and , as i said , it &apos;s not particularly mal@@ le@@ able .
this picture was taken in 198@@ 2 , just before the i@@ b@@ m p@@ c was even anno@@ un@@ ced .
they would put up 2@@ 5,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 000 , okay , okay .
it is in fact a ci@@ tru@@ s ju@@ i@@ cer and when i say that , you never see it as anything else again .
now , in order to do this , we need the right kind of language .
indeed .
even more so than geor@@ ge or@@ well , the author is , of course , al@@ d@@ ous hu@@ x@@ ley .
steven stro@@ g@@ atz : all right , so that already gives you a hin@@ t of what happened .
but the promise of neuro@@ science has led to some really high expe@@ c@@ tations and some o@@ verb@@ lo@@ wn , un@@ pro@@ ven cla@@ im@@ s .
this is an example that you might care about someday , and i hope you never do , because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer .
but we know about those things .
so what once was a solution now became the problem , and ironi@@ cally , we look for the solution in ra@@ w food .
six years old .
my guess -- given that you &apos;re at a conference called ted@@ global -- is that most of you are x@@ en@@ ophi@@ les , whether or not you use that term .
this is not about l@@ ous@@ y marri@@ ages , this is not about jobs that su@@ ck .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worl@@ ds , like there , for example , that tom mel@@ cher has shown us .
that &apos;s odd .
now there &apos;s comp@@ elling evidence that it really needs to be 3@@ 50 .
it &apos;s become my re@@ ward at the end of the day , something i really ch@@ eri@@ sh .
so if there was something that she could do , that would be amazing .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
will@@ ard wi@@ gan !
i said , &quot; look , please , let me take care of her , ok , because i know her , and believe me , she &apos;s like a small at@@ omi@@ c we@@ apo@@ n , you know , you just want to hand@@ le her really g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly . &quot;
mi@@ gu@@ el ni@@ co@@ le@@ li@@ s : a mon@@ key that contro@@ ls a robot with its thoughts . no , really .
you don &apos;t want it to make sense , right ?
africa can only be transformed by en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed leaders .
we &apos;ve got 800 people in te@@ hr@@ an who watch ted@@ talks .
that &apos;s a fine definition . so we can put it this way : we can say that , you know , we have this cha@@ in of events .
but even though we &apos;re only experi@@ en@@ cing it one piece at a time , that &apos;s just where the technology is right now .
in fact , jon@@ as and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you .
the microbes in your gut can influ@@ ence your weight and your mo@@ ods .
and i stood in the park giving signals .
till a couple months later , i went back to the same air@@ port -- same plane , i think -- and looked up , and it said c .
i &apos;m kind of hoping some conver@@ sations here might help me finish it .
there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
when you read this pra@@ yer , it sounds incredibly sel@@ fish , self-@@ cent@@ ered .
and it has close to 1,@@ 200 such plants for 300 occu@@ pants .
gets it wrong , you press a button on the sho@@ ck box .
that is one of the most extraordinary recor@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
they are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the sho@@ ots are growing against the ve@@ ctor of gravity and the roots toward the ve@@ ctor of gravity .
as the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es are growing up , their hor@@ ns actually curve back@@ wards .
rob@@ bie mi@@ zz@@ one : thank you .
&quot; master control off . the hell with it . way off . &quot;
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m really worried about .
okay , religious mani@@ a : there &apos;s ra@@ p@@ ture , there &apos;s wee@@ ping , there &apos;s visions .
all right , those of you , i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf c@@ art worry about an un@@ fair advan@@ tage .
they are not@@ ori@@ ous for kno@@ cking off high-@@ end designs and s@@ elling them at very low prices .
why are you going to do x , y or z .
it &apos;s probably the best place in the world to see them .
and that &apos;s when i realized that the green@@ ing of america starts first with the po@@ ck@@ ets , then with the heart and then with the mind .
so steve the i@@ .t. guy invi@@ ted me out to one of philadelphia &apos;s whi@@ te-@@ tab@@ le-@@ cl@@ oth , extremely expensive restaurants .
and you can see , they &apos;re ran@@ ging from shoes , r@@ ings that were made out of sta@@ in@@ less ste@@ al , phone co@@ vers out of plastic , all the way through to spinal im@@ plants , for example , that were created out of medi@@ cal@@ -@@ grade ti@@ tani@@ um , and engine parts .
but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades .
i remember my image of you was that you were up on the sh@@ ore y@@ elling at me . &quot;
so , we do a lot of simulation and model@@ ing , and also experim@@ ental work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to , in the aggre@@ gate , produce the predict@@ able behavior of ant coloni@@ es .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
we brought this ra@@ w data in and we fil@@ tered it .
it was a pre@@ cur@@ sor to india , a m@@ essen@@ ger from gon@@ d@@ wan@@ a -- a lost paradi@@ se of dinosau@@ rs is@@ ol@@ ated for millions of years .
you see , the ba@@ ker , in this moment , has become , in a sense , sort of , the god of his d@@ ough , you know , and his d@@ ough , well , while it &apos;s not an intelligent life form , is now alive .
it &apos;s a new telescope .
ok , here we go .
because , you know , histori@@ cally , if you &apos;re not being respe@@ cted , you &apos;re probably not going to wind up in a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum , mu@@ tu@@ ally profi@@ table relationship with people .
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the united states stock market , 70 percent of the oper@@ ating system for@@ mer@@ ly known as your pen@@ sion , your mort@@ ga@@ ge .
you were all over the place .
it actually re@@ minds me of the most important lesson re@@ gre@@ t can teach us , which is also one of the most important les@@ sons life tea@@ ches us .
i think there &apos;s biology to that .
but now kids with degrees are often head@@ ing home to carry on playing video games , because you need an ma where the previ@@ ous job requi@@ red a ba , and now you need a ph@@ d for the other .
and i would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ards and the police cars -- &quot; i &apos;ve got a green card ! i &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;
and their policy pres@@ cri@@ ption is to make government more accoun@@ table , focus on the capital markets , invest , don &apos;t give anything away .
and then , new change , we had hair band@@ s , clothing and the con@@ dom for your mobile phone during the rain@@ y seas@@ on .
and another two and a half to four years for a construction per@@ mit and issue , and then four to nine years for actual construction .
so one-@@ third of it re@@ pri@@ ses the stories of bibli@@ cal fig@@ ures like ab@@ ra@@ ham , moses , joseph , mary , j@@ es@@ us .
you &apos;ll exp@@ and your vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ thi@@ er lifestyle .
but it &apos;s this process of trial and error that explains this great diver@@ gen@@ ce , this incredible performance of western economi@@ es .
at this point i decided to make a p@@ ause .
and for another , deci@@ ding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day .
so we can let computers do all the complicated cr@@ yp@@ to@@ graphy for us , and then we &apos;ll use the paper for veri@@ fi@@ cation .
and i &apos;m also thri@@ ll@@ ed to be in the fore@@ play se@@ ction .
so no ga@@ v@@ age , no force feeding , no fac@@ tor@@ y-@@ like conditions , no cru@@ el@@ ty .
now what would that look like ?
my mom is not here , so i can say this now .
keith chen : could your language affect your ability to save money ?
i &apos;m on a remote island in mi@@ cr@@ on@@ esi@@ a .
i was rais@@ ed in se@@ ou@@ l , korea , and moved to new york city in 199@@ 9 to at@@ tend college .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible christmas music .
and i say &quot; thank you for being here &quot; because i was silent for 17 years .
it &apos;s just a curve without in@@ fle@@ ction .
the rain@@ y ones fall down as if they &apos;re in a rain@@ stor@@ m , and the s@@ no@@ w@@ y ones kind of flu@@ tter to the ground .
and i want to tell you a great story . when ag@@ nes first started fighting to stop female gen@@ it@@ al mu@@ ti@@ lation in her community , she had become an out@@ cast , and she was ex@@ iled and she was sl@@ ander@@ ed , and the whole community turned against her .
thomas bar@@ nett dra@@ ws a new map for peace
and it takes a school board member who is going to lob@@ by for you and say , &quot; know , the distri@@ ct is trying to im@@ pose this , but you have the freedom to do o@@ ther@@ wise . &quot;
but that &apos;s okay .
like with the water , instead of talking about it , we &apos;re going to sa@@ il a million li@@ ters of har@@ b@@ or water from copenhagen to shanghai , so the chinese who have the coura@@ ge can actually di@@ ve in and feel how clean it is .
we can &apos;t sit i@@ dly by here either .
simple , p@@ ure , does not do web pages , is not a dat@@ ab@@ ase . &quot;
cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve sol@@ ved all the long-@@ range , high-@@ speed problems .
in our imagination , it has to be light .
steve tru@@ gli@@ a : a lea@@ p from the edge of space
two men , ra@@ hu@@ l and ra@@ ji@@ v , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational back@@ ground , similar occu@@ pa@@ tion , and they both turn up at their local accident emergen@@ cy com@@ pla@@ ining of ac@@ ute ch@@ est pain .
you can start to un@@ p@@ ack the choices involved because of the side effects .
so , cyber@@ crime , do watch out for it .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehi@@ cles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first auton@@ om@@ ously dri@@ fting car .
now , laun@@ ching a moral revolution has got to be hard , right ?
as the author of the study told me , children who have a sense of -- they &apos;re part of a larger nar@@ ra@@ tive have greater self-@@ confidence .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
does anyone know what this is ?
and then in an extra@@ ordin@@ arily b@@ art simp@@ son@@ -like , ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le way you &apos;ve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reas@@ s@@ ert your freedom to speak .
it &apos;s natural . it &apos;s everywhere .
the other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is cor@@ al b@@ lea@@ ching . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
our colleagues in the center for qu@@ ant@@ um compu@@ tation and spin@@ troni@@ cs are actually meas@@ uring with their las@@ ers de@@ co@@ her@@ ence in a single elec@@ tr@@ on sp@@ in .
i wish she could meet my dad .
bottom right , banglades@@ h has the same population density as ba@@ h@@ rain but con@@ su@@ mes 100 times less per person .
this was amazing .
so despite the pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive title , this present@@ ation is really about sa@@ fe@@ ty and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative , confi@@ dent and in control of the environment around them .
and for that reason , we ought to be saving it .
it &apos;s why social organization has gro@@ wn from the h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
and i told the author , after they did my inter@@ view , that i che@@ ated in that same course .
but more and more frequ@@ ently these days i &apos;m seeing terrible things under@@ water as well , things that i don &apos;t think most people realize .
this might be what bec@@ k would be experi@@ en@@ cing when he reali@@ zes he &apos;s in dan@@ ger .
you might want to use the stairs , there .
and that &apos;s why a group of us are building a free , online sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us in big history for high school students throughout the world .
our members de@@ fy the bin@@ ary descri@@ ption of how we so often describe our young .
bf : sure .
and from all of these numbers , i start with only two or three vari@@ ables .
all consciousness is about communication .
you take off and land at a local air@@ port .
now , let &apos;s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they refle@@ ct .
this is a tremend@@ ously complicated process .
if you let that go un@@ regul@@ ated , you &apos;ll continue to make and break chemical bon@@ ds , forming an even more diver@@ se mix@@ ture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tar@@ ry stuff in your p@@ an , right , that &apos;s difficult to was@@ h out . so that &apos;s what the ori@@ gin of life would have looked like .
we &apos;re at best ignor@@ ed and mali@@ g@@ ned and ab@@ used , at worst , by ne@@ g@@ ligen@@ t regul@@ at@@ ory agen@@ cies , per@@ ni@@ ci@@ ous z@@ oning and la@@ x govern@@ mental accoun@@ t@@ ability .
but i believe that the rules that i &apos;m talking about are universal , of course -- that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavior and dres@@ s and tradi@@ tions , and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the u.s .
he said , &quot; i have to be there by a certain time , so i have to leave today . &quot;
im@@ probably , this l@@ g@@ bt singing cho@@ ir has demon@@ strated how women are investing in tradition to create change , like al@@ chemi@@ sts turning disc@@ ord into harmon@@ y .
this is my apartment .
cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are small cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans .
and there was about a thousand co@@ at han@@ gers that i &apos;d colle@@ cted .
then another character was a hal@@ f-@@ woman , hal@@ f-@@ che@@ e@@ ta@@ h -- a little hom@@ age to my life as an athle@@ te .
i am hon@@ ored to be here , and i &apos;m hon@@ ored to talk about this topic , which i think is of gra@@ ve importance .
this could totally re@@ v@@ amp the pe@@ sti@@ cide industri@@ es throughout the world .
and even though , i think you &apos;ll agree , it is prob@@ able that during the time she was away , she was kid@@ na@@ pped and re@@ plac@@ ed by an alien cl@@ one , i love her and wait for her still .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for pre@@ venting avi@@ an flu . thank you .
you know , this little office of the condu@@ ctor .
you collect interest and do nothing in between .
so we collect your b pl@@ uses and your a min@@ uses and we aggre@@ gate them into a number like 3@@ .@@ 4 , which is stam@@ ped on your fore@@ head and su@@ ms up who you are .
so my idea was that , instead of sitting down and re@@ aching for a lot of contro@@ ls , that you would sit on the chair , and it would automatically balance your weight against the force requi@@ red to re@@ cline .
the most important message of roots and sho@@ ots : every single one of us makes a difference , every single day .
then there was similar mortality in &apos; 9@@ 7@@ - &apos; 98 .
we are not equi@@ pped for the 21@@ st century .
i want to talk to you about fear .
so , i had been there almost three months , and i was t@@ our@@ ing around the city going to different squ@@ at@@ ter areas and juli@@ us was ta@@ gging along , and he was bu@@ g e@@ yed and at certain points we were walking around , he grab@@ bed my hand for support , which is something most ken@@ y@@ ans would never consider doing .
we all got down onto the ice , and i then got into my swimming co@@ stu@@ me and i di@@ ved into the sea .
so really i want to design for out@@ comes .
clouds sel@@ dom visit this area .
for example , as a 15@@ -@@ year-old , i was considered out@@ stand@@ ingly good at multi@@ pl@@ ying numbers because i had memor@@ i@@ zed the multi@@ pli@@ cation tables and i know how to use lo@@ gari@@ th@@ ms and i &apos;m quick at mani@@ pul@@ ating a slide rule .
and so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
so , hus@@ band@@ s start be@@ ating wi@@ ves , mothers and fa@@ thers beat their children , and after@@ ward , they feel awful .
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
and the one that particularly bo@@ ther@@ ed me in the burn department was the process by which the nur@@ ses took the ban@@ da@@ ge off me .
the book is called &quot; 50 dangerous things . &quot;
and it &apos;s funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil .
and then it &apos;s a black hole .
and this chart goes back to 1@@ 500 .
so i don &apos;t want somebody who &apos;s going to cut and run at the first opportunity .
this was movie day -- that she organized -- where all the kids went to the movi@@ es .
thanks .
so the develop@@ ers say , well this is great . okay , so if we have a conven@@ tional building , we have a fix@@ ed en@@ vel@@ op@@ e , maybe we can put in 14 units .
pu@@ ff@@ u@@ ff@@ u@@ ff , what ?
and even being here -- i mean the last few days , i &apos;ve known really hei@@ ghts of ob@@ ses@@ sive behavior i never thought about .
and he appe@@ al@@ ed to virtu@@ e .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ first century could easily be 3@@ .@@ 3 , even higher percent .
it &apos;s not going to be easy .
and they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
in africa , epidemi@@ ologists have not@@ ed for a long time that truck dri@@ vers and migr@@ ants are more likely to be infe@@ cted than other people .
in other words , we &apos;re looking for a nee@@ d@@ le in a ha@@ yst@@ ack .
i used to be against nuclear power .
so , a huge problem .
it &apos;s not necessary for understanding the importance of what i &apos;m going to say .
but as a dy@@ s@@ functional , as a dy@@ s@@ functional mur@@ derer / psy@@ cho@@ tic , he &apos;s something much more complicated .
thus arri@@ ved conveni@@ ence .
and the sen@@ ior water rights hol@@ ders , if they don &apos;t use their water right , they risk losing their water right , along with the economic value that goes with it .
it &apos;s only half the length of this one .
i mean this went through thi@@ ck and thin , through war and peace , through bo@@ om times and re@@ c@@ es@@ sions .
what &apos;s also happening in shanghai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and as the father was admini@@ ster@@ ing these instru@@ ctions , a car dro@@ ve by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teena@@ gers , a hand went out from the front pas@@ sen@@ ger window , and -- &quot; b@@ am , b@@ am ! &quot; -- killing the father .
at the ei@@ gh@@ th stop , a girl came in with a giant du@@ ff@@ el bag and anno@@ un@@ ced she had pants for s@@ ale for a dollar -- like you might sell batter@@ ies or c@@ and@@ y on the train .
we had rela@@ y ra@@ ces with condoms , we had children &apos;s con@@ dom@@ -@@ blo@@ wing champi@@ on@@ ship .
i can ask her what to read .
so no weapons , no speed , no strength , no fan@@ gs , no cla@@ ws -- how were we killing these animals ? my@@ ster@@ y number one .
but she jump@@ s to action when called to du@@ ty !
we have a huge v@@ est@@ ed interest in it , par@@ tly because it &apos;s education that &apos;s meant to take us into this future that we can &apos;t gras@@ p .
it actually didn &apos;t look bad . the cell walls looked in@@ t@@ act .
the scientists that made this c@@ ute little creature ended up s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ ing it and eating it afterwards .
i became a par@@ ent .
so now back to the cooking question and back to the design .
the human goal here was to identify cam@@ ps for rel@@ o@@ cation based on pri@@ ority need .
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?
how do i prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
how do we protect it into the future ?
i was dat@@ ing this guy , right ?
and so today , i &apos;m going to show you four , because i hope to have a competi@@ tive advan@@ tage at the end of this , still .
and then on may 5@@ th , 194@@ 5 , the sie@@ ge came to a sudden end when holl@@ and was liber@@ ated by the alli@@ es .
and that is the future of the web .
we get to hate each other on gun control and abor@@ tion and the environment , but on these fi@@ s@@ cal issues , these important fi@@ s@@ cal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divi@@ ded as people say .
now i don &apos;t mean extra gi@@ ll@@ s or something -- something we care about , like aging .
we haven &apos;t even started the american stock@@ pi@@ le .
the first country we went to work in , the ba@@ ham@@ as , was pa@@ ying 3@@ ,@@ 500 dollars for these drugs .
2@@ 8 great , big , powerful ya@@ ks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- i don &apos;t just have my spee@@ do , but there &apos;s a big film cre@@ w who then send all the images around the world .
and in the particular example we have here , it &apos;s a film , &quot; twi@@ sted issues , &quot; and the first person says , &quot; now this is sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly a film . it fa@@ ils the google test miser@@ ably . &quot;
can you all spot the fake smile here ?
so they actually think they &apos;ve hit the person less hard than they have -- rather like the tick@@ ling .
and if we were able to rei@@ ter@@ ate , then the fing@@ ers of our hand would be people who looked like us , and they would have people on their hands and so on .
so i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to de@@ di@@ cate myself .
she comes from an odd place .
do women feel pi@@ ty for you and have sex with you more frequ@@ ently ? &quot;
he was in a movie called &quot; tor@@ ch song tri@@ lo@@ gy . &quot;
re@@ a@@ ders don &apos;t want to pay for yesterday &apos;s news , and ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers follow them .
and despite bu@@ cky &apos;s prop@@ he@@ cies that everything would be mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zed and technology would make an incredible st@@ yle -- access to comfort , to am@@ en@@ i@@ ties -- it was very , very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image , would be very , very sty@@ li@@ sh@@ ly packa@@ ged .
so i started to ask myself questions about it .
r@@ b : well , i knew i had about half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and i also knew that the chan@@ ces were that if i jump@@ ed , i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
we actually get 17@@ 5 hor@@ se@@ power into one cu@@ bi@@ c foot .
so it &apos;s early days , to be up@@ front , but we &apos;re excited about it .
but even if you to@@ ss a few numbers around , you &apos;re probably talking of an effective population of about 20,000 animals .
it &apos;s complete security theater .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of el@@ ation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in reti@@ rement than before .
and c@@ et@@ ac@@ e@@ ans moved into a world without bo@@ unds .
if you close your eyes right now in this room , you &apos;re aware of the size of the room from the rever@@ ber@@ ation and the boun@@ cing of the sound off the surfaces .
somebody goes to another country , says , &quot; how fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curi@@ ous their culture is . &quot;
so in the animal kingdom , they are about exp@@ and@@ ing .
if we look at this carefully , we find it &apos;s about 40 percent of the earth &apos;s land surface is de@@ vot@@ ed to agriculture , and it &apos;s 60 times larger than all the areas we com@@ pla@@ in about , our subur@@ ban spra@@ w@@ l and our cities where we mostly live .
thank you very much .
we have flexible microscop@@ ic prob@@ es that we can bring down into the body .
this is one that com@@ miser@@ ates with you .
now , sylvia ear@@ le turned me on to this ex@@ act same cor@@ al .
now , the idea that all of this represents , i think , is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis , recogni@@ zing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress .
when i was a kid , i hi@@ d my heart under the bed , because my mother said , &quot; if you &apos;re not care@@ ful , someday someone &apos;s going to break it . &quot;
and something else that happens is that those ima@@ ge-@@ making regions where you have the pl@@ ot@@ ting of all these neu@@ ral ma@@ ps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the associ@@ ation cortex , where you can make recor@@ ds of what went on in those islands of ima@@ ge-@@ making .
now this is very unusual , because glob@@ ally we find that , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , people feel better as their country gets ri@@ cher .
and the object is for@@ ced to continue to collap@@ se to an in@@ fini@@ tely small object .
there &apos;s a new not@@ ation in the 19@@ th century that expres@@ sed this , and if you use that not@@ ation , the equ@@ ations get a lot sim@@ pler .
i would disa@@ gre@@ e that people know they &apos;re not going to win .
this is basically bringing the whole thing together .
4@@ 3 percent of the children in need of an inf@@ ant feeding program to prevent mal@@ nutri@@ tion and early death are now getting the food supp@@ le@@ ments they need to stay alive and to grow .
bottom left , well , there &apos;s no one .
we obser@@ ve faci@@ al expres@@ sions , body language , and we can in@@ tu@@ it feelings and emotions from our dialo@@ gue with one another .
it &apos;s everything the man &apos;s military hat@@ es .
it &apos;s got a nice kind of flo@@ wing , organic form , very consi@@ stent with the brazi@@ li@@ an culture -- i think good design ad@@ ds to culture .
now , if you &apos;re a go@@ dd@@ ess of stars and planets wouldn &apos;t you rele@@ gate insects to somebody else ?
so , that &apos;s what i want to talk about today .
he was born in 1957 , and you can imagine what his chil@@ d@@ hood looked like and felt like , and what his life has been like over the last 50 tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous years .
what determin@@ es our quality of life is how we rel@@ ate to these reali@@ ties , what kind of meaning we as@@ sign them , what kind of at@@ titude we cl@@ ing to about them , what state of mind we allow them to tri@@ gger . &quot;
they &apos;re both wonderful and largely the same , except that computers happened in between .
and actually , it &apos;s really been pi@@ one@@ ered by alex@@ a internet , which don@@ ates this colle@@ ction to the internet archi@@ ve .
until i tell you who said it .
jo : what about this ? our good old friend .
every game we play is different .
so i hope to see more of that in the future , and hope online video distribu@@ tion to be embra@@ ced by the research community .
so , what i want to tell you , very brie@@ fly , is a few examples of the exci@@ tement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at least we believe , that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
so the highest bar is what you &apos;re stri@@ ving to beat .
fortunately , i did not actually en@@ act that gra@@ ve pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis .
there isn &apos;t anything wrong with nu@@ ke .
it &apos;s a tremendous improv@@ ement .
the friends of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen people have higher degre@@ e , and are more central than the random people themselves .
and it does not requi@@ re a re@@ fin@@ er@@ y .
and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now , in terms of its expansion .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
one day a nasa mana@@ ger comes into my office , si@@ ts down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
i meet people all the time who have those , and they &apos;re not necessarily happy .
it &apos;s almost impossible not to find a sa@@ vings behavior for which this strong effect isn &apos;t present .
you su@@ sp@@ ended these pieces . you let it fall fl@@ at on the floor .
you look at some other scientific revol@@ utions , and this case , i &apos;m talking about the solar system , that &apos;s cop@@ erni@@ c@@ us , darwin &apos;s evolution , and te@@ ct@@ oni@@ c pl@@ ates , that &apos;s we@@ gen@@ er .
oh , oh , dad . oh , dad .
so , you hi@@ ke around and -- this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
well , if that &apos;s the problem , then that &apos;s much easi@@ er .
it &apos;s white , black , hi@@ sp@@ ani@@ c , asi@@ an .
no , don &apos;t just give me an example .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sti@@ cking to their g@@ uns , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what other people want or re@@ com@@ mend .
and so , on an over@@ cast morning in janu@@ ary , i head@@ ed north off in a sil@@ ver ch@@ ev@@ y to find a man and some peace .
okay . anyway .
he told me that those fal@@ se pa@@ pers were the most medi@@ a-@@ relevant and the least useful he &apos;d had to make in all his life .
and you must be wondering , &quot; what on earth ?
and increasing inten@@ sity of dr@@ ou@@ ghts and f@@ loo@@ ds will sever@@ ely impact bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ kets of the world , caus@@ ing massive fam@@ ines and economic decline .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bible literally ?
now some of you will be wondering what mar@@ mi@@ te is .
j@@ h : so you &apos;re not a g@@ ate@@ kee@@ per for these forces .
seen from those stairs , all politi@@ cians today seem the same , and politics has come to res@@ em@@ ble a sport that inspi@@ res more ag@@ gr@@ essi@@ ven@@ ess and p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m than social co@@ he@@ sion and the desire for civi@@ c pro@@ ta@@ gan@@ ism .
champi@@ on sounds so goo@@ fy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse .
so every gra@@ in of sand is unique . every be@@ ach is different .
how do the taliban in your area get people to join them ?
and then den@@ g xi@@ a@@ oping came and brought money to china , and brought them into the main@@ stream again .
this leads to this question .
should we be colle@@ cting all of that guy &apos;s data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he &apos;s up to no good ?
but you do it , by -- what i ju@@ st@@ -- you know , you do experiments , and you write down things sometimes , you make obser@@ va@@ tions , you know .
and they follow five little hab@@ its that con@@ ve@@ ys to them extraordinary lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , compar@@ ati@@ vely speaking .
and one reason is because of something i call the &quot; growing le@@ th@@ ality of hat@@ red . &quot;
now the case , &quot; n@@ el@@ son m@@ and@@ ela : change leader , &quot; became part of the research base for a chapter in ros@@ ab@@ eth &apos;s new book called &quot; confidence . &quot;
and what they have found uni@@ form@@ ly is you get rid of the shoes , you get rid of the stress , you get rid of the in@@ ju@@ ries and the a@@ il@@ ments .
so i lo@@ ved writing so much that i &apos;d come home from school , and i would take out pieces of paper , and i would sta@@ ple them together , and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because i lo@@ ved using my imagination .
and there i met these two , a@@ z@@ ra on the left , mau@@ re@@ en on the right .
he was trying to work out how many ways you can re@@ combine those 14 bi@@ ts and still make a perfect square .
you can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after l@@ unch , and it was quite incredible .
and we were gr@@ ate@@ ful that i was able to get pre@@ gn@@ ant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
co@@ -@@ evolution ent@@ win@@ ed insects and birds and plants forever .
roots make a fir@@ m foundation .
look at that f@@ on@@ t there . my wife was so pi@@ s@@ sed .
this map can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can add in new data .
maybe we are among the first generation that really under@@ stands this digital cur@@ ating of ourselves .
we don &apos;t know the answer to that either , but we will learn that answer this year , thanks to nasa &apos;s ke@@ pler space telescope , and in fact , the smart money , which is to say the people who work on this project , the smart money is sug@@ gest@@ ing that the fra@@ ction of planets that might be su@@ it@@ able for life is maybe one in a thousand , one in a hundred , something like that .
audience : fold .
i met ma@@ hm@@ oud one year later .
gets you thinking about color .
we are missing my mother &apos;s story , who made sure with every si@@ ren , with every raid , with every cut off@@ -@@ of electricity , she played pu@@ ppe@@ t shows for my brothers and i , so we would not be sc@@ ared of the sounds of explo@@ sions .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
and here brazi@@ l is in the western box .
unfortunately , these belie@@ fs are based on as@@ sump@@ tions that don &apos;t always hold true in many countries , in many cultur@@ es .
it can actually swim through the air .
we are in the middle of a tremendous clas@@ h between the old and the new .
and in fact , the number of sites that are using re@@ ca@@ pt@@ cha is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digi@@ ti@@ zing per day is really , really large .
so the same sort of a process , without the proteins , is happening on the inside of their pi@@ pes . they didn &apos;t know .
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
sorry . i can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
they said , &quot; you know what ? indi@@ ans don &apos;t do innovation . &quot;
really the exciting thing about a motor@@ cycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design .
but , the whole point is that india is the nation@@ ali@@ sm of an idea .
that &apos;s ne@@ o-@@ na@@ z@@ i math for you .
we &apos;re ben@@ ding the curve .
the human brain is puzz@@ ling -- it is curi@@ ously large given the size of our bodies , uses a tremendous amount of energy for its weight and has a bizar@@ r@@ ely dense cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex . but : why ? neuro@@ scientist su@@ z@@ ana her@@ cul@@ an@@ o-@@ hou@@ z@@ el puts on her dete@@ ctive &apos;s cap and leads us through this my@@ ster@@ y . by making &quot; brain sou@@ p , &quot; she arri@@ ves at a star@@ t@@ ling conclusion .
and i took these two men and did what i call an indi@@ re@@ ct ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation .
the chinese obje@@ cted , and so the com@@ promise was &quot; more than 90 percent . &quot;
the extra dimen@@ sions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
it &apos;s called ple@@ aching , or gra@@ fting trees together , or gra@@ fting in@@ o@@ sc@@ u@@ late matter into one con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous , v@@ as@@ cular system .
and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference .
and they &apos;d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions -- and actually , quite v@@ ali@@ d solutions -- to the things that they &apos;d been working on .
and the reason he was , was that len is a cold fish .
i can stand here right now and see , as i go te@@ aring into the water after him , the moments slo@@ wing down and free@@ zing into this arran@@ gement .
i as@@ sume you have standards .
we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
but you know , they have , after all , evolved in a country without tele@@ phones , so they are de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized . i mean , of course there might be other good reasons , but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be .
it was here in the late &apos; 60s and early &apos; 7@@ 0s that major dr@@ ou@@ ghts brought three million people to become depen@@ dent upon emergen@@ cy food aid , with about up to 2@@ 50,000 dying .
but i &apos;d never done anything about myself .
but actually the power to re-@@ brand things -- to understand that actually our experiences , costs , things don &apos;t actually much depend on what they really are , but on how we view them -- i genu@@ in@@ ely think can &apos;t be over@@ st@@ ated .
so at least you &apos;ll ad@@ mit that if fru@@ it flies are not as clever as mi@@ ce , they &apos;re at least as clever as pi@@ ge@@ ons .
there are more active vol@@ can@@ o@@ es bene@@ ath the sea than on land by two orders of ma@@ gni@@ tude .
we found 90 percent of the first deci@@ sion@@ -@@ makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent returned some of it .
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
next , i make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers .
&quot; all right . well , what do you want to write ? what do you want to write about ? &quot;
for anyone out here who has cancer , what would you re@@ com@@ mend ?
and i feel very stron@@ gly that it &apos;s not good enough for us to have gener@@ ations of kids that think that it &apos;s ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
&quot; why did i do the setting , why i don &apos;t care for the process@@ es . just understand me , please . &quot;
and big companies like in@@ tel or smaller design fir@@ ms like ide@@ o or star@@ tu@@ ps like bu@@ mp , were invi@@ ting me to give work@@ sh@@ ops , just to practice this idea of sm@@ as@@ hing electronics and every@@ day objects together .
it &apos;s masses and masses of la@@ yers .
imagine van go@@ gh being born before the technologies of cheap oil pain@@ ts .
and simply put , if penguins are dying , it means our oceans are dying , and we ultimately will be affe@@ cted , because , as sylvia ear@@ le says , &quot; the oceans are our life@@ -@@ support system . &quot;
first , we obser@@ ved that not all mosqui@@ to species bi@@ te on the same part of the body . strange .
that &apos;s the study we did , and here are some of the head@@ lines that came out afterwards .
now , you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to coloni@@ z@@ ers and im@@ peri@@ ali@@ sts .
sens@@ ori@@ ly , we &apos;re taking in all sorts of things -- mix@@ tur@@ es of things that are good , bad , exciting , fri@@ ghten@@ ing -- to come up with that sens@@ ori@@ al ex@@ pos@@ ure , that sen@@ sation of what &apos;s going on .
i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well what &apos;s the point of these , h@@ ein@@ rich ?
just to go back to the states , if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in the states , you get 1,@@ 200 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in the u.s .
that &apos;s what happens at the office .
it had this resili@@ ence that is what we need in our modern world .
growth was negative .
and when i walked up to the prison director , i said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to let her out .
they &apos;re actually changing the way in which ideas are gener@@ ated .
normally , a ro@@ ot will find phosphorus all by itself .
so the un@@ bought effici@@ ency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper .
first of all , economi@@ sts aren &apos;t supposed to be inspi@@ ring , so you may need to work on the t@@ one a little .
sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese , the young man se@@ ated on the whe@@ el@@ chair here , was once a child soldi@@ er , under the general &apos;s comm@@ and , until he di@@ so@@ be@@ yed orders , and the general shot off both his legs .
it &apos;s completely ir@@ relevant .
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and di@@ sper@@ s@@ ants on the big stuff -- the birds , the tur@@ tles , the dolph@@ ins , the glam@@ or@@ ous stuff .
the eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
i had come to completely trust this little blue do@@ t and its reas@@ sur@@ ing blue hal@@ o .
you can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they &apos;re more po@@ tent than the actual drugs .
if you were an edu@@ cated child , you would know how to not only use the astro@@ lab@@ e , you would also know how to make an astro@@ lab@@ e .
and one trilli@@ on of that goes to op@@ e@@ c .
the lat@@ est fig@@ ures show that the old model is not working . there are a lot of great invest@@ ments that you can make . if you are investing in tar sands or s@@ hal@@ e oil , then you have a port@@ fo@@ li@@ o that is cra@@ mm@@ ed with sub-@@ prime carbon as@@ sets .
he uses scale to more and more spect@@ acu@@ lar effect , whether on the roof of a temple in sing@@ apo@@ re , or in his increasingly ambi@@ ti@@ ous instal@@ lation work , here with 19@@ 2 func@@ tioning se@@ wing machines , fabri@@ cating the fla@@ gs of every member of the united nations .
i &apos;m influ@@ enced by everything i read , everything i see .
it &apos;s very very important .
what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspe@@ cti@@ ves ?
in fr@@ ance , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be re@@ moved , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
clearly a complex problem , but is it complicated ?
and where did they go ? if we can understand this , then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this .
but this fl@@ ash@@ bulb memory , as it &apos;s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the ev@@ ent , but my emotional connection to it .
and the integration that happened is on a film , which i &apos;ll be happy to send you , so you can really see what actually happened instead of my verb@@ ali@@ zation of it , but the two of them not only came together and changed their belie@@ fs and mor@@ als of the world , but they worked together to bring , for almost four years now , through various mo@@ squ@@ es and sy@@ na@@ go@@ gues , the idea of how to create peace . and he wrote a book , which is called &quot; my ji@@ had , my way of peace . &quot; so , transformation can happen .
let &apos;s fa@@ st-@@ forward to the san francisco bay area many decades later , where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d las@@ er scan@@ ning system .
it &apos;s a really lucky demo@@ graphic to work with .
this is what radi@@ c@@ als can do with open@@ ness .
she said , &quot; i &apos;ll buy it , but i &apos;m also going to repli@@ cate it . &quot;
ri@@ ck war@@ ren : a life of purpose
it is what makes you function ; it is what makes every organ@@ ism function .
so that is a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynami@@ c .
you think he &apos;s a nice bal@@ ding guy , but he &apos;s just dec@@ lar@@ ed war on the content business . find the commercial stuff , mas@@ h it up , tell the story your way .
and so here we are .
back when it was the ar@@ pan@@ et , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message process@@ or actually got a bu@@ g in it .
fall@@ out shel@@ ter for the climate crisis , i would say , looks something like this , or this , which is an inten@@ sive urban agriculture faci@@ lity that &apos;s due to go on my lab building at ny@@ u .
d@@ h : wow ! boy !
how do you create a day vot@@ ed by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire non@@ violence day , the 21@@ st of september ?
and they did not turn out to be the is@@ lam@@ ist boo@@ g@@ y@@ man that the di@@ ct@@ ators were always using to justi@@ fy their regi@@ me .
we had no idea what key we were going to play in .
we probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; fantastic ! what a smart guy who is per@@ forming this low , &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statisti@@ cal results than we could .
next is may@@ n@@ ard si@@ pes .
we can all change the world .
i believe you should be on time . but i felt at practice , for example , we start on time , we close on time .
now , you might ask yourself three questions at this point .
that &apos;s where we were , 19@@ 00 .
so what the discovery of african wri@@ ters did for me was this : it saved me from having a single story of what books are .
and they say , &quot; no , no , that &apos;s what it says here in our hol@@ y book . &quot;
spent the first six months brea@@ st@@ feeding , the way i can see it . &quot;
so the best way of expla@@ ining it is to just show it .
find that which is not .
and that , after a couple of days , made the ken@@ y@@ an press feel safe to talk about it .
think about se@@ at bel@@ ts .
of course , bri@@ tain doesn &apos;t have any deser@@ ts .
and then let &apos;s remember that we &apos;ve been taught the ex@@ act opposite by the powers that be , that compassion clouds your thinking , that it gets in the way , that vulner@@ ability is weak@@ ness , that emotions are not to be tru@@ sted , and you &apos;re not supposed to take things personally , which is one of my favor@@ i@@ tes .
first of all , i can gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee you that their tex@@ t@@ books didn &apos;t have secret agen@@ t viruses , and they didn &apos;t have hor@@ ror stories .
but it &apos;s got these big holes in its shi@@ eld .
john ed@@ ward , sylvia brow@@ ne and ro@@ se@@ mary al@@ tea , they are other oper@@ ators .
and i don &apos;t mean che@@ wing the cr@@ ab@@ s .
this is sort of incredible . but actually it &apos;s quite beautiful , when you take a picture of it .
all right .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
i &apos;m si@@ ck of it .
it &apos;s dna which is pretty bad@@ ly fra@@ g@@ mented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reas@@ semble the whole genome .
i wanted to save the world and then make everyone happy .
and so they took them to some safe place .
&quot; but we for@@ give you , because you didn &apos;t know it .
and it was quite curi@@ ous . he said , &quot; of all the differences between the ra@@ ces of men , the color of the skin is the most con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous and one of the best mar@@ ked . &quot;
now , it could have killed us off . it could have killed us off , and maybe it nearly did , but you see , we don &apos;t know .
unfortunately this rover is , like , ten times the size of the , you know , mas@@ s-@@ wise , of the other rover , or three times the mass .
the transpar@@ ency law they &apos;d passed earlier that appli@@ ed to everybody else , they tried to keep it so it didn &apos;t apply to them .
and one of the tools i like personally is using video .
i could ro@@ tate it by a third of a turn , or a half a turn , or put it back down on its image , or two thir@@ ds of a turn .
and of course you can search to find the questions that you &apos;re interested in by using the same h@@ ash code .
it &apos;s clearly un@@ di@@ stur@@ bed by us .
thank you very much .
other countries come with different things .
now i &apos;m not sug@@ gest@@ ing that the next stage of the repu@@ tation economy is about ad@@ ding up multiple rat@@ ings into some kind of empty score .
other sands , when these micro@@ me@@ te@@ ori@@ tes come in , they va@@ po@@ ri@@ ze and they make these foun@@ tains , these microscop@@ ic foun@@ tains that go up into the -- i was going to say &quot; up into the air , &quot; but there is no air -- goes sort of up , and these microscop@@ ic glass be@@ ads are formed inst@@ antly , and they har@@ den , and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon , they have these beautiful col@@ ored glass sp@@ her@@ ul@@ es .
here &apos;s the ki@@ cker . i don &apos;t remember that .
the first one is the famous one , the prin@@ ting press : mov@@ able type , o@@ il@@ -@@ based in@@ ks , that whole complex of innova@@ tions that made prin@@ ting possible and turned europe up@@ si@@ de-@@ down , starting in the middle of the 14@@ 0@@ 0s .
but also , more recently , we started ac@@ quir@@ ing video games , and that &apos;s where all hell bro@@ ke loo@@ se in a really interesting way .
well , if you &apos;re building a bridge , details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignor@@ e the details .
they &apos;re at a big disa@@ d@@ van@@ tage in hospi@@ t@@ als .
and for the next three years , her fa@@ te will be having sex with him every day , as a fa@@ vor for getting her in school .
the dance of our gl@@ an@@ ces , the clas@@ h , pulling each other through our per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al pun@@ ctures , then h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st , h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st , ho@@ st on ho@@ st of ill , in@@ ju@@ red pres@@ ences , squ@@ ander@@ ed , con@@ sum@@ ed .
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .
we can beat extreme poverty , star@@ vation , aids .
we had the sp@@ elling bee in con@@ jun@@ ction with the g@@ wom@@ e@@ us club .
this has been fantastic .
the nuclear waste typically goes into a dr@@ y c@@ ask stor@@ age out back of the parking lot at the re@@ actor site because most places don &apos;t have underground stor@@ age yet .
in fact , everything was better than fine .
it so@@ unded familiar , and i quickly considered another possibility , and i re@@ ached out with my left hand , as my fing@@ ers bru@@ shed against something fu@@ zz@@ y , and i came across an e@@ ar , the e@@ ar of a dog , perhaps a gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever .
today , i am standing on the ted stage with the yo@@ -@@ yo in front of you .
my next surgeon &apos;s ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment was , co@@ inci@@ d@@ entally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
so he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them , and they cra@@ fted his ne@@ sts for him .
and now i &apos;m not swimming with a nice long stro@@ ke , i &apos;m sort of cr@@ ab@@ bing it this way .
so , to find strong evidence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , bene@@ ath the surface of a moon 7@@ 50 million miles away from the earth is really quite a@@ sto@@ unding .
yes , it &apos;s happening here .
thank you . thank you .
well i used to love english literature , and i de@@ b@@ ated in college , which one should i do ?
but they are incredibly good fli@@ ers . this particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilome@@ ters .
now i &apos;m an arts graduate ; i love my@@ th and magic and exist@@ enti@@ ali@@ sm and self-@@ lo@@ a@@ thing .
and i could go five years and never , ever see a hom@@ eless person .
the rich@@ est country .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in population , there &apos;s been tremendous decline on both si@@ des , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your bas@@ eline to 1950 .
well , we feel that now is the time to pro@@ ve we &apos;re right .
one more .
and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do .
now , what theori@@ es do we want to use to look at this ?
and it is a ch@@ u@@ ck@@ le until , you know , the musi@@ cians , who are musi@@ cians who play the piano , listen to this , say , &quot; i can &apos;t believe it ! it &apos;s just what it &apos;s like to play the piano . &quot;
k@@ b : ok , give her a ro@@ und of app@@ l@@ ause .
i thought i could put cell to@@ wers and create a network .
we see this general ba@@ g@@ g@@ iness of the structure , the lack of conc@@ ern with rules and the way that we &apos;re used to learning on the bl@@ ack@@ board , and so we think that something has gone wrong .
and the no@@ se is fix@@ ed , the whole animal is fix@@ ed .
this new computer , built to become the ner@@ ve center of a de@@ fen@@ se network , is able to perform all the complex mathemati@@ cal problems involved in counter@@ ing a mass ene@@ my raid .
you can very preci@@ sely calcu@@ late what your co2 emissions are , and then you will be given options to reduce .
al@@ e@@ x ste@@ ffen : exactly , this is a land@@ min@@ e-@@ dete@@ cting flower .
as a matter of fact , one of the most fun things i &apos;ve ever , ever done in my whole life , was this christmas seas@@ on at the gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim in new york .
they do a very good job because their children are eating their food , but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect , and they feel that they are doing something wor@@ th@@ while .
and there , sa@@ dly , will always be wars .

humans , li@@ ve@@ stock and pe@@ ts are , now , 98 percent of the total world &apos;s mass of ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates on land and air .
how can we create inter@@ faces , new windows into the minds of animals , with the technologies that exist today ?
coal oil lamp -- we didn &apos;t have electricity in our farm home .
cros@@ s-@@ country ski@@ er jan@@ ine she@@ pher@@ d hop@@ ed for an ol@@ ympi@@ c me@@ d@@ al -- until she was hit by a truck during a training bike ri@@ de . she shares a powerful story about the human potential for re@@ co@@ very . her message : you are not your body , and giving up old dre@@ ams can allow new ones to so@@ ar .
and the men who actually apply atraz@@ ine have even more atraz@@ ine in their ur@@ ine , up to levels that are 2@@ 4,000 times what we know to be active are present in the ur@@ ine of these men .
the land of the free has become a legal min@@ e@@ field , says phili@@ p k. ho@@ ward -- especially for teachers and doctors , whose work has been paraly@@ zed by fear of su@@ its . what &apos;s the answer ? a law@@ yer himself , ho@@ ward has four pro@@ posi@@ tions for simpli@@ fying us law .
thank you very much .
a friend of mine expla@@ ined to me , before the &apos; 7@@ 9 revolution , it was two . after the revolution , three .
this time of year they cro@@ ss back to africa .
so here &apos;s what we do . basically , we developed nu@@ mer@@ ous mobile apps , every one of them expla@@ ining a particular concept in math .
this was me running around in the back garden mi@@ d-@@ summer .
oh yeah .
thank you very much .
if winter is caused by de@@ meter &apos;s sa@@ d@@ ness , then it must happen everywhere on earth simul@@ tane@@ ously .
prak@@ ash , as many of you know , is the san@@ sk@@ rit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of she@@ dding light on some of the deep@@ est mysteri@@ es of neuro@@ science .
and si@@ mon was working on a new c@@ able , wa@@ cs , the west africa c@@ able system , that stre@@ tched from li@@ s@@ bon down the west coast of africa , to co@@ te d &apos;@@ i@@ vo@@ i@@ re , to ghana , to nigeria , to cam@@ ero@@ on .
so , despite what it says in the bible , about , you know , &quot; look to the ant , tho@@ u slu@@ g@@ g@@ ard , &quot; in fact , you could think of those ants as reser@@ ves .
go and study it . &quot;
in those head@@ y days , we were experim@@ ent@@ ing with ch@@ at rooms and online virtual communities .
tw@@ enty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-@@ sahar@@ an african growth is slightly better than india .
we should be mar@@ ching towards a global society .
c@@ c : i can &apos;t do that , son .
so , i &apos;m going to try to draw this fan@@ g@@ to@@ oth here .
my fo@@ ster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he mo@@ tiv@@ ated me and gave me a purpose to live in america .
i took the same concept of min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , because , why did i bring meditation into the indian prison ?
we &apos;re lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
the center of the atlantic where the mix@@ ing is , i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish , because they man@@ age their fi@@ sher@@ ies well , they &apos;re doing a good job .
and the slide behind me bar@@ ely sc@@ rat@@ ches the surface of how wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad they are in animals .
that &apos;s the second of the quad@@ ru@@ ple .
so being a gang leader in the inner city wasn &apos;t such a bad deal in the mid@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s .
so now i try and go after her , but i &apos;m practi@@ cing flying .
that ca@@ sts your decision in dou@@ bt , redu@@ ces the confidence you have in the decision , redu@@ ces the confidence you have in the performance , the performance in terms of sol@@ ving the puzz@@ les .
they also pollu@@ te their ne@@ x@@ t-@@ door neighb@@ ors .
today we know that families are living further and further apart , and that defini@@ tely takes a toll on family relationships and family bon@@ ds over distance .
it &apos;s an ar@@ abi@@ c medi@@ um school .
b@@ m@@ w is a pretty safe car .
what just happened ? do you have a wal@@ let ?
and not only that , we need to create a great transition to get there , and we need to pa@@ ve that great transition with good things .
so here &apos;s the scene for the first question i &apos;m going to ask you .
we &apos;ve taken away the auton@@ omy of this animal . &quot;
she communi@@ c@@ ates well with the imm@@ un@@ ologists at the hospital .
translate this into adult language .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both si@@ des .
thank you .
well , in pi@@ zza , we &apos;re not really -- there &apos;s no w@@ inning . how do you win pi@@ zza ?
maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons .
i think no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts put this best .
like , i get hundreds of them a day . period .
it didn &apos;t happen .
i &apos;m not talking about the difference between reality and desire , which i can do because i &apos;m not inside the bel@@ t@@ way .
in asia alone , it will be over a billion people .
&quot; n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v &apos;s family fl@@ ed russia . how could the young n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v , sitting inno@@ cently and elegan@@ tly in a red chair , le@@ af@@ ing through a book and bu@@ tter@@ flies , imagine such disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ement , such loss ? &quot;
so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather pla@@ yful attempt to try to anno@@ y fru@@ it flies might actually have some relev@@ ance to a human psychi@@ at@@ ri@@ c disorder .
so when you consider these two facts , it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one ou@@ tri@@ ght .
i was inten@@ sely moved during all this .
over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing success is hard , and that &apos;s when most of the coloni@@ es are lost , and we found that in the cities , bees are survi@@ ving better than they are in the country .
now , from k@@ h@@ an aca@@ de@@ my , we saw that short 10@@ -@@ minute videos worked much better than trying to record an h@@ our@@ -@@ long le@@ cture and put it on the small@@ -@@ form@@ at screen .
and so they invented the scientific journ@@ al as a way of synchroni@@ zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
repu@@ tations are vol@@ ati@@ le . loy@@ al@@ ties are fi@@ ck@@ le .
this much , right ?
i mean , that &apos;s all i heard growing up .
b@@ hu@@ tan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the ne@@ west democracy in the world , just two years ago .
the sla@@ very at the peak of the sla@@ ve trade in the 17@@ 8@@ 0s : there were about 8@@ 0,000 sla@@ ves transpor@@ ted from africa to the new world .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
the to@@ ol@@ box exists .
so our story ends at the beginning -- the beginning of all things , the big bang .
they give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train w@@ re@@ ck .
he &apos;s now kee@@ ping a con@@ stant distance to thomas .
there were a lot of pro@@ grams in architecture and design that were about poin@@ ting people in the direction of a better design for a better life .
if you ask what kind of a situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people becoming friends and alli@@ es , the technical answer is a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum situation .
when we started , over 20 years ago , 1,000 children were being paraly@@ zed every single day by this virus .
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these se@@ als that are very , very tiny .
part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an exist@@ enti@@ al threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
&quot; he mer@@ ely makes you think that he does . &quot;
h@@ ence , you could share some of your nutri@@ tional resources instead of mon@@ o@@ poli@@ zing them .
oh .
in infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
in short , there was a lot of water and there weren &apos;t very many people .
i &apos;m not a doctor ; i &apos;m a che@@ f , i don &apos;t have expensive equipment or medicine .
and i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of too bad , because we need 100 million units a year . &quot;
because she knows that i adop@@ ted her and that i can &apos;t have kids .
i would say that the future of life and the di@@ gni@@ ty of human beings depen@@ ds on our doing that .
so he was talking about the law in bri@@ tain which is the communi@@ cations data bill , an absolutely ou@@ tra@@ geous piece of le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation .
and i just finished a couple of months ago .
i &apos;m going to share some of these visions with you in a bit , but first i want to take a look at how we got here .
by &quot; why , &quot; i mean : what &apos;s your purpose ?
so we asked lar@@ ry and nat@@ alie hem@@ pel to write a comm@@ entary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to biology letters .
so each building has its own person@@ ality .
it &apos;s being used by ngos all over east africa , small ngos doing their own little projects .
but what to do about people who are vot@@ ing with a blank bal@@ lot ?
first of all , i en@@ jo@@ yed writing .
and an exp@@ o is a totally bon@@ kers thing .
well , there are kind of two ways of pulling through .
and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing proper@@ ty called emergen@@ ce .
we wi@@ tn@@ essed the er@@ up@@ tion of violence in the streets .
jo : no . what do you think this is ? oni@@ on . jo : oni@@ on ? no .
so i decided i would build one wind@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
we use five pol@@ ym@@ ers in the natural world to do everything that you see .
oh , it &apos;s almost 50 / 50 . okay .
this second set of head@@ lines -- you can see that families and marri@@ ages are starting to shift .
we don &apos;t want to lose pulling power , nor direction .
i wanted to know what that would take , so i worked with professor j@@ or@@ gen r@@ anders from nor@@ way to find the answer .
then i &apos;m looking : the next lan@@ e , lan@@ e two , is 1@@ 2.@@ 8 .
ad@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ration will over@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
so , we &apos;ve been , as i say , very successful , very lucky , in having companies catch the vision of this , from cars -- car makers who want to put a stere@@ o system in the front for the kids , and a separate system in the back -- oh , no , the kids aren &apos;t driving today .
this game &apos;s called &quot; spo@@ re . &quot; i &apos;ve been working on it for several years .
that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .
we also had someone else who said , &quot; &apos; the infinite mon@@ key ca@@ ge &apos; idea is ridiculous .
if you look at classrooms right ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a far@@ ther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundam@@ entally different .
and it &apos;s a wonderful setting , as i hope you &apos;ll find , and a great i@@ con to the best of the victori@@ an tradition .
voices : no .
jo : normal . england and america , england and america .
and while , again , you needed pati@@ ence to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the per@@ mi@@ ts , over time we were able to start a company with dr. son@@ o , who r@@ uns a large community development organization in the th@@ ar desert , which is one of the remote and po@@ or@@ est areas of the country .
it &apos;s like a project on which they &apos;re constantly ad@@ ding up@@ gra@@ des and improv@@ ements and corre@@ ctions .
the fa@@ st@@ est woman to ever run a mile did it in 4 : 15 .
and as we held on , and we brea@@ th@@ ed as one , we knew we weren &apos;t on this journey alone .
now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years .
and there &apos;s an auth@@ ority figure in the corner behind the teacher &apos;s des@@ k who knows all the answers .
it &apos;s a total , total mess .
they knew it was dangerous .
and i &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
in fact , while we dro@@ ve 14@@ 0,000 miles , people didn &apos;t even notice .
and i believe we need to str@@ eng@@ then this approach in modern diplom@@ acy , not only between states , but also within states .
teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
the large ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der , a parti@@ cle physics acceler@@ ator , that we &apos;ll be turning on later this year .
this is the face on mars , which was -- in 197@@ 6 , where there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because people thought this was mon@@ um@@ ental architecture made by mar@@ ti@@ ans .
so the co@@ p takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little mat@@ ri@@ x and looks for about two , three minutes . no keys .
and that &apos;s an in@@ for@@ mal way of present@@ ing it -- that &apos;s why there &apos;s a difference .
we say , the ray of light came this way ; the galaxy must be there , ok .
what are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
okay . this is camp one .
there &apos;s only one absolute reality by definition , one absolute being by definition , because absolute is , by definition , single , and absolute and sing@@ u@@ lar .
and then there &apos;s that c@@ lich@@ é , the african di@@ ct@@ ator or minister or offi@@ cial .
but cul@@ min@@ ating -- and that &apos;s where this ho@@ o@@ ks into the the@@ me of my little talk -- is this medi@@ a@@ the@@ que , which is su@@ sp@@ ended from the can@@ ti@@ le@@ ver@@ ed por@@ tion of the building .
it &apos;s in the mi@@ d-@@ pac@@ i@@ fic . it &apos;s about five days from anywhere .
we wanted to try and map these . and to do that what we did was we ma@@ pped their habitat needs .
for me they normally happen , these career cri@@ ses , often , actually , on a sun@@ day ev@@ ening , just as the sun is starting to set , and the gap between my hop@@ es for myself , and the reality of my life , start to diver@@ ge so pain@@ fully that i normally end up wee@@ ping into a pil@@ low .
how wide would the ver@@ ge have to be for that to work out ?
and she knew she risk@@ ed death and she was literally g@@ un@@ ned down and roll@@ ed over by that t@@ ank .
we calcu@@ late gra@@ dient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there &apos;s a high prob@@ ability of life .
we &apos;re taking over a thousand sam@@ ples for each brain .
if he was a car designer , p@@ he@@ w , we &apos;d all be driving one .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellu@@ lar mechani@@ cs .
but nobody wanted to hi@@ re me .
there are only a few species that can do it .
why are they engaging with cyber@@ space ?
you can make a bio@@ cen@@ sor out of ye@@ ast to detect pollu@@ tants in water .
charlie to@@ d@@ d : the shared experience of absur@@ di@@ ty
if you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world , and as a result there was just one nuclear bom@@ b created that was used to destroy a city such as mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i or some other big city , me@@ g@@ acity , the addi@@ tional death rates due to this a@@ ver@@ a@@ ged over 30 years and then sc@@ al@@ ed to the population of the u.s .
&quot; and , baby , &quot; i &apos;ll tell her , don &apos;t keep your no@@ se up in the air like that .
and thank you for listening .
fast forward through the &apos; 9@@ 0s , we had the dot@@ com revolution and a temporary rise in produ@@ ctivity growth .
we have experiences in our lives , certainly , when sharing has been ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
your doctor would have to be ridicul@@ ously su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous that you have the cancer in order to give you this test .
and it turns out that with 60 minutes cameras roll@@ ing in the back@@ ground , after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his ho@@ ok and he had his -- he wor@@ e this arm for less than two hours and was able to po@@ ur himself a drin@@ k and got quite emotional over the fact that , quote -- his quote -- it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s felt like he &apos;s had an arm in 39 years .
be flexible , be open-@@ minded , let the best ideas win .
another is , you can make ngos accoun@@ table .
the instrument that i used turned into a cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t .
within the light sport aircraft categ@@ ory .
and my daughter -- oh , sur@@ ely she is extra@@ -@@ intelligent . &quot;
why ?
so for now , let &apos;s turn to the evidence for dark matter .
so in that sense , he &apos;s the symbo@@ lic third side of the middle east .
we have 1.@@ 5 million en@@ roll@@ ments , 6 million qui@@ zz@@ es in the 15 classes that have laun@@ ched so far have been sub@@ mitted , and 14 million videos have been viewed .
they were looking for an alternative to sch@@ mal@@ tz .
on the other hand , we kids still dream about perfe@@ ction .
this needs to stop , and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating these problems , and i be@@ g them , i bes@@ e@@ e@@ ch them to just stop it .
however , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mi@@ ce , in principle -- and what i mean by in principle is , we probably can actually imple@@ ment these fi@@ xes within a decade .
and another story of the cy@@ lin@@ der beg@@ ins .
if you &apos;re living in iran , you &apos;re fac@@ ing cen@@ sor@@ ship , har@@ as@@ s@@ ment , ar@@ rest , tor@@ ture -- at times , execu@@ tion .
what about the data and communication software which we need in the future ?
i was so proud .
although that figure ri@@ ses to four percent of ce@@ o &apos;s and business leaders .
so here &apos;s one last thing i &apos;d like to men@@ tion .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chi@@ ps .
so , step two , i hold the device up , and then i sight its altitude there so i can see it clearly now .
we thought we had a hand@@ le on all the re@@ ef fish diversity -- evi@@ d@@ ently not .
this was from nature magazine . these are con@@ cent@@ r@@ ating solar , ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy plants , lin@@ ked in a so-called &quot; super@@ gri@@ d &quot; to supply all of the electri@@ cal power to europe , largely from developing countries -- high-@@ vol@@ tage d@@ c curr@@ ents .
has anyone ever been to as@@ pen , col@@ or@@ a@@ do ?
it &apos;s a bit e@@ erie , isn &apos;t it ?
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
why is this happening ? why this confidence ?
they were together while praying .
but i know that we should be looking at the structure of the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy to answer that question .
you no longer have the queen &apos;s prote@@ ction .
in africa , the afri@@ cans say , &quot; i am , because we are . &quot;
here &apos;s charles when he was three . so he would be 100 this jun@@ e .
from the stand@@ point of calcu@@ lation , they &apos;re as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two .
now , here we go , one side , the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was .
their clients aren &apos;t happy , and people go hun@@ gr@@ y .
don &apos;t think , &quot; oh , we created the internet for our own benefit . &quot;
but each of these species , even the t@@ ini@@ est pro@@ ch@@ lor@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ i , are master@@ pieces of evolution .
so , okay , i &apos;m going to america .
but i was skil@@ led at hi@@ ding it , and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and as@@ pire to .
when i went home that night after getting my tat@@ too , i basically stayed up all night .
i don &apos;t know how many of you remember this : another moral her@@ o , 15 years ago , a@@ aron feuer@@ stein , who was the head of mal@@ den mill@@ s in mas@@ sach@@ u@@ set@@ ts -- they made po@@ lar@@ te@@ c -- the factory bur@@ ned down .
this is because we have 10,000 of those underground fir@@ es that you also have in pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ani@@ a here in the united states .
you can see the dead@@ lines and the u@@ sage graph .
thir@@ ty-@@ five to 50 percent of women forget or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion therapy , they are increasing -- they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions .
why not make a local s@@ ani@@ tary pad for my new wife ?
now obviously , as mad@@ die &apos;s chemistry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to ge@@ ek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
this seems weird to us , because each of us only experiences an individual exist@@ ence , and we don &apos;t get to see other bran@@ ches .
i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to un@@ favor@@ able economic climate , and so close to my country .
and actually , it was respon@@ ding to clients that i had who didn &apos;t have very much money , so they couldn &apos;t afford very much .
or , as father di@@ vine in har@@ le@@ m used to say to folks , &quot; some people pre@@ ach the go@@ sp@@ el .
deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
return rate -- the one that sor@@ os was so worried about -- 9@@ 7 percent .
is it pla@@ to , is it ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le , is it k@@ ant , is it mi@@ ll ?
the second house ever built is house number two .
and bell then goes on to explain to the students .
taylor wil@@ son : my radical plan for small nuclear fi@@ s@@ sion re@@ ac@@ tors
over 20,000 economi@@ sts whose job it is , competi@@ tive ent@@ ry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
an ac@@ cre@@ tion itself is a huge sin@@ k of carbon di@@ o@@ xi@@ de .
one or two euro@@ s was enough to make 20 percent of cars disappear from ru@@ sh hours .
and we were quite intri@@ gu@@ ed with playing with the notion of invi@@ sibility .
now , the next question that you would like to ask is : what would you like to measure ? what would you like to analy@@ ze ?
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vi@@ gor@@ ously , you can actually get a local er@@ adi@@ cation .
but wh@@ en@@ ever we give a thing a name that belon@@ gs to something else , we give it a whole network of analo@@ gi@@ es too .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
and 20 years later , mira@@ cul@@ ously , we collabor@@ ated with a company from mal@@ i , the so@@ gol@@ on mar@@ i@@ on@@ ette trou@@ pe of ba@@ ma@@ ko , where we made a piece about a t@@ all gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
we &apos;ve got pl@@ enty of these things .
everything gives out some kind of data , whether it &apos;s sound or smell or vibra@@ tion .
and i think by ali@@ g@@ ning international ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates that are addres@@ sing hunger and domestic ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates that are addres@@ sing o@@ be@@ sity , we might actually look for long-@@ term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discover@@ s that , mer@@ ely by u@@ tter@@ ing a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
first there were dru@@ ms and then kno@@ ck@@ -@@ kno@@ ck jo@@ kes .
when we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor &apos;s office and we walk in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear .
now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own auton@@ om@@ ous vehi@@ cles .
so let &apos;s make architectural sand dun@@ es and a be@@ ach cab@@ ana .
this is my message to you .
john bo@@ han@@ n@@ on : dance v@@ s. power@@ point , a mod@@ est pro@@ posal
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s expl@@ ore that .
the ou@@ ter circle shows what exerci@@ ses they were focused on .
they &apos;re drin@@ king tea , they &apos;re having sandwi@@ ches .
well , it &apos;s not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that ban@@ ks accept dir@@ ty money , but they priori@@ ti@@ ze their profi@@ ts in other destru@@ ctive ways too .
well here a picture of something called the mean species ab@@ un@@ dance .
that &apos;s why the prime minister went on television . he said , &quot; this has left us all with a very big ha@@ d@@ do@@ ck . &quot;
clearly we don &apos;t have 10 planets .
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
mark sha@@ w : one very dr@@ y dem@@ o
they want to know how china li@@ fted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how mexi@@ co &apos;s o@@ portuni@@ da@@ des program improved scho@@ ol@@ ing and nutri@@ tion for millions of children .
so back in abi@@ d@@ j@@ an , i was given a chance to lead a workshop with local car@@ to@@ oni@@ sts there and i thought , yes , in a context like this , car@@ to@@ ons can really be used as weapons against the other side .
and on that stairs , that &apos;s where the traff@@ i@@ ck@@ ers always stand and there &apos;s a lot of exchange of fire .
my name is ka@@ il@@ ash . and i like to en@@ rich lives through techni@@ col@@ ored glass .
when i was a kid , i atten@@ ded mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i school up to si@@ x@@ th grade in atlan@@ ta , geor@@ gia .
so i &apos;m going to share with you some cover@@ ages that i feel demon@@ stra@@ te the story@@ telling power of photograph@@ y .
so we did it . okay ?
does that really explain what we &apos;re seeing with the intellectu@@ al proper@@ ty bat@@ tles no@@ wa@@ days ?
so you are currently breathing for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ de .
and that is that despite all the resources at my dis@@ posal , and despite all our kind of appar@@ ent sophi@@ sti@@ cation , i know i could never have designed something as elegan@@ t and as totally in t@@ une with the local conditions as this . ok ?
was i who i had been before the cr@@ ash , before this road divi@@ ded my life like the sp@@ ine of an open book ?
she &apos;s my sister , my wife , my cou@@ sin , my neighb@@ or .
it is about em@@ power@@ ing vulnerable communities to t@@ ack@@ le difficult , expensive and dangerous human@@ it@@ arian dete@@ ction tas@@ ks , and doing that with a local resource , pl@@ enty available .
it helps us to understand so many different bi@@ ts of the scientific world .
one is reci@@ pro@@ city , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
&quot; i believe : &quot; it did not mean , &quot; i accept certain cre@@ ed@@ al arti@@ cles of fai@@ th . &quot;
just consider this : five million ni@@ ghts have been boo@@ ked on air@@ b@@ n@@ b in the past six months alone .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it c@@ ute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
yeah , to actually do this thing -- the actual chari@@ ot is made of gold .
so you start out with teen@@ y flu@@ ctu@@ ations when the universe was at this point , now four times smaller , and so forth .
the ide@@ als of partici@@ pat@@ ory democracy are repres@@ ented through supp@@ len@@ ess rather than ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty .
and then you ask , why economi@@ sts ?
i &apos;m going to talk today about the pleas@@ ures of every@@ day life .
i mean , i heard his band is playing at another party the same night .
and here you can see it &apos;s ro@@ tat@@ ing about the ver@@ tical axis only , creating cir@@ cles .
for example , in the cau@@ cas@@ us there &apos;s a site where you find local ne@@ ander@@ thal tools .
politics and politi@@ cians will only succe@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
boy : what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
and if i haven &apos;t reve@@ al@@ ed my pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces already , i think that life has been about molecular computers building electro@@ chemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electro@@ chemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
now , we can spe@@ cu@@ late and philosophi@@ ze this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
he wanted us instead to use these cheap car@@ d@@ board vie@@ wers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be dama@@ ged .
and they said , &quot; me ? defe@@ ated by a woman ?
s@@ w : yeah .
i got the camera angle wrong . that one is just am@@ at@@ eur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
but the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deser@@ ve to be on that bridge , that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge , but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it .
but i didn &apos;t start out obsessed with food .
so we ask people , how much should gra@@ ce be bl@@ amed in this case , which we call a failed attempt to har@@ m ?
in ta@@ xis , you get condoms .
and there probably are special cases of that .
all of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody or@@ der@@ ed it , nobody asked for it .
so when i was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to teach you about time and space in the future . &quot;
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
but i brought along here a lu@@ mp of coal -- right here , one lu@@ mp of coal .
and the models that we need to predi@@ ct the future do not have enough data to re@@ fine them .
and yet deser@@ tifi@@ cation is a major threat on all continents , affe@@ cting some 1@@ 10 countries and about 70 percent of the world &apos;s agri@@ cultural dr@@ y@@ lands .
it is there within every human being .
so the situation seemed pretty des@@ per@@ ate .
there needs to be a new standard of fres@@ h , pro@@ per food for your children . yeah ?
and it talks about the back story of something like a t-@@ shirt .
it &apos;s a marker of empathy . it &apos;s a marker of ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dation .
and you wonder , is it practi@@ cal ? and it turns out if i had not been -- unfortunately , we have some light bulb changes .
for the past year , i &apos;ve been fortun@@ ate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and o@@ be@@ sity researchers in the country , and the best part is , just like ab@@ ra@@ ham lincoln surro@@ unded himself with a team of ri@@ v@@ als , we &apos;ve done the same thing .
so now we &apos;re in a situation where we have a product , which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the market@@ place , which is a very wonderful place to be .
those are the ori@@ gam@@ i cre@@ ases forming , and now you can see the air@@ bag inf@@ late and find out , does it work ?
what do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
and the transformation continu@@ es .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the fra@@ mers &apos; bas@@ eline for this re@@ public .
these particles also have anti-@@ particles , which have opposite char@@ ges .
about a year pri@@ or to this oil sp@@ ill , a 17 year-old student had invented a degre@@ as@@ er .
it really does refle@@ ct the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the hol@@ y gra@@ il of our industry .
now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to , and comp@@ are it to this biosphere .
and that is not a bad thing , in itself .
a couple of hours later , the sun will shine on the next ma@@ gni@@ fying glass , and a different smell will be e@@ mitted .
hold out your hand for me . watch it kind of closely .
but what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
but this is the unit of cur@@ ren@@ cy that we &apos;ve taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
they said , &quot; we look at it every day . &quot;
it &apos;s about human connection .
anyway , here &apos;s the book .
and my time is up , and thank you for your time .
so , he wouldn &apos;t say much .
&quot; not we , i@@ . &quot;
now , this is the lo@@ west of the sta@@ ges .
and people in white hat@@ s sa@@ iling bo@@ ats .
you know , try making some charts like this at home .
the first is sele@@ cting a feed@@ stock , prefer@@ ably something that &apos;s regional , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufac@@ turing .
two of the largest me@@ mes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these l@@ ol@@ cat@@ s -- just sil@@ ly pictures of cat@@ s with text .
now that was che@@ ating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be amy the hur@@ t five year-old little sister , but amy the special uni@@ corn .
she said that a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people could change the world .
because life doesn &apos;t really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world di@@ vor@@ ced from their systems .
camera &apos;s ready -- that &apos;s it .
imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people .
but if you ask about their education , they p@@ in you to the wall . because it &apos;s one of those things that goes deep with people , am i right ?
we should focus on the positive .
we were so fru@@ strated .
i lost my face .
actually , i had this ta@@ x@@ i dri@@ ver telling me , &quot; listen , i am breathing freedom .
the fact is that we simply don &apos;t know when the warming that we create will be u@@ tter@@ ly over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by feed@@ back lo@@ ops .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good lu@@ ck .
he keeps mobili@@ zing .
it &apos;s working its way slowly across the u.s. and wi@@ ping out popu@@ lations of bats , and scientists have est@@ im@@ ated that 1,@@ 300 metri@@ c tons of insects a year are now rema@@ ining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats .
the force on the right &apos;s going to ob@@ liter@@ ate it .
he who consi@@ ders himself the ser@@ v@@ ant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-@@ expression . he who see@@ ks self-@@ expression shall fall into the p@@ it of arro@@ gan@@ ce .
i was in new york on mon@@ day present@@ ing it to the i@@ o@@ c .
you see a dolphin here , and there &apos;s a dolphin , and there &apos;s a dolphin .
i remember taking my son &apos;s school class . he was eight at the time , and all the little boys , they kind of -- you know , they were little boys , and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hun@@ ting scen@@ es there was a dog po@@ oping in the fore@@ ground — — kind of an in-@@ your@@ -@@ face jo@@ ke by the artist .
and suddenly the man started expla@@ ining that actually the whole resi@@ stance had a huge problem : even the top experts could not man@@ age to ble@@ ach an ink , called &quot; inde@@ li@@ ble , &quot; the &quot; wat@@ er@@ man &quot; blue ink .
and i did . so , he kept me in line .
all materials are available for use .
this whole , what ben ber@@ nan@@ ke has said , the cha@@ o@@ tic un@@ win@@ ding of the world &apos;s financial system , it &apos;s about -- they don &apos;t know , they didn &apos;t know what they were doing .
luc@@ ille ball kept us laugh@@ ing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
this guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two p@@ ens at once : you know , you , pen , do this , and you , pen , do this .
are you holding her ?
it &apos;s not just always smi@@ ling . now i &apos;ve kind of evolved it , so i have this look .
pollen is tiny . it gets on to things , and it sticks to them .
so this is a student &apos;s opinion on what his experience of games are .
i took an architectural rule about function and form and transl@@ ated it into new@@ spa@@ per content and design .
look at that . you can &apos;t just make this stuff up , la@@ dies and gentle@@ men .
well when the da@@ f-@@ 2 re@@ cept@@ or is active , then it tri@@ g@@ gers a series of events that prevent fo@@ x@@ o from getting into the nu@@ cle@@ us where the dna is .
and then , i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what makes me ti@@ ck now .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
is it just literally for control , for hand@@ -@@ stick control ? why am i doing that ?
and that , in fact , these connections were vast and that we were all em@@ bed@@ ded in this bro@@ ad set of connections with each other .
i love pu@@ n and the relation to the un@@ conscious .
getting a little more technical now .
so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
tom sh@@ an@@ n@@ on shows off his gravi@@ ty-@@ de@@ fying , o@@ ther@@ worl@@ dly sculp@@ ture -- made of simple , earth@@ ly materials -- that flo@@ ats and sp@@ ins like planets on magne@@ ts and su@@ spen@@ sion wire . it &apos;s sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ inspired art at its most hea@@ ven@@ ly .
i was imag@@ ining it was like 20 percent when i first started .
if it &apos;s that bad , we &apos;ll re@@ act .
and i also made a game about the tra@@ il of tears .
your final pi@@ tch , ste@@ wart .
now i know what some of you are thinking .
let them be on inst@@ ant m@@ essen@@ gers .
an effective system for re@@ vie@@ wing the ethi@@ cal su@@ it@@ ability of clinical trials is pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al to sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard partici@@ pants within any clinical trial .
next satur@@ day , set a day a@@ side , design yourself a beautiful day , and use sa@@ vor@@ ing and min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness to en@@ h@@ ance those pleas@@ ures .
you and your kids are fine .
and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of li@@ thi@@ um at time zero , going forward , and then going back@@ ward .
to defe@@ at our policy of con@@ tain@@ ment , not about ide@@ ology .
something i never talk about in scientific me@@ et@@ ings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
there &apos;s a limb prosthe@@ tic up here , similar actually one on the soldi@@ er that &apos;s come back from iraq .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
i went to five countries around the world .
it com@@ for@@ ted her .
so i make other hat@@ s as well .
i &apos;m now going to show you a short film , i &apos;ll step to the side .
what can you say ? what a mess .
so his da@@ d@@ dy is president for life of equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al guinea , a west african nation that has expor@@ ted billi@@ ons of dollars of oil since the 199@@ 0s and yet has a truly app@@ all@@ ing human rights record .
we have brains that evolved in medi@@ um@@ -@@ si@@ zed ancestors which couldn &apos;t walk through ro@@ cks .
but how would you actually go about te@@ sting such a theory ?
because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa .
so they might go through , pass through the oka@@ p@@ i fa@@ un@@ al reser@@ ve .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustain@@ ability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
we can say that , fundam@@ entally , the difference between ger@@ on@@ t@@ ology and geri@@ at@@ ri@@ cs is that ger@@ on@@ t@@ ology tries to in@@ hi@@ bit the rate at which met@@ abo@@ li@@ sm la@@ ys down this damage .
normal technology or innovation happens like this : somebody has an interesting idea , some other scientist or engineer , they take it to the next level , they make a theory about it and maybe they pat@@ ent it , and then some industry will make a contract of ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vi@@ ty to manufac@@ ture and sell it , and then , eventually , a bu@@ yer will buy it , and we hope that they are going to use &#91; it &#93; for a good purpose .
after w@@ inning this prize , my life changed .
so , they say the eyes are the windows of the soul -- turns out they &apos;re a window to a whole lot more stuff .
we can also include two more char@@ ges cor@@ respon@@ ding to the gravi@@ ta@@ tional force .
all the see@@ ds get e@@ aten .
and then i said , &quot; it &apos;s bad , right ? &quot;
let me high@@ light it for you .
and then when they hit the eastern end of che@@ ap@@ side , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called po@@ ul@@ try .
we all had to fast during ra@@ ma@@ dan .
i &apos;ve taken two pictures here and i &apos;ve made them artifi@@ cially symmetri@@ cal .
and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you see my colleagues in new york ? &quot;
and so my whole life then was de@@ di@@ cated to ro@@ t@@ c and the military .
now we did pur@@ ch@@ ase a vac@@ cine , you &apos;ve probably all heard about it , made by san@@ o@@ fi@@ -@@ a@@ venti@@ s .
indeed , this object is a domestic farm , for fi@@ shes and green .
it &apos;s not pleas@@ ant .
if so , that &apos;s going to requi@@ re that our inven@@ tions are as important as the ones that happened over the last 150 years .
let &apos;s see if they con@@ gre@@ gate around certain ideas .
we don &apos;t like di@@ le@@ mm@@ as . we like solutions .
but the one story stuff ...
and so let &apos;s do a series of compar@@ is@@ ons to show you .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and ko@@ ko , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh and kan@@ z@@ i , pan@@ b@@ ani@@ sh@@ a , ir@@ ene pep@@ per@@ berg , al@@ e@@ x the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will invi@@ te back al-@@ q@@ a@@ e@@ da , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
this is vi@@ vi@@ en@@ ne west@@ wood . no !
i &apos;m not sure about you guys , but i &apos;ve had experiences when i &apos;ve walked into a store and i &apos;ve know exactly what i &apos;ve wanted and i &apos;ve sear@@ ched everywhere for that perfect lamp that i know where i want to sit in my house and i just can &apos;t find the right thing , or that perfect piece of je@@ wel@@ ry as a gift or for myself .
thank you .
from there , to the modern vent@@ ri@@ lo@@ qu@@ ist &apos;s dum@@ my , is but a brief moment in history .
no reaction ? that with even -- ok , and this .
girl : hol@@ ly .
so i want you to imagine when in a couple of years , when we &apos;ve started to apply this clou@@ d-@@ based information , when we really have the a@@ .@@ i@@ . physician and le@@ verage our brains to conne@@ ctivity to make decisions and diagno@@ stics at a level never done .
these are expres@@ sions of truth as a@@ we@@ -@@ full things , by meaning they are things you can wor@@ ship .
and thir@@ dly , i had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took .
well now if i take that sugar d@@ ough , the sugar d@@ ough doesn &apos;t want to condu@@ ct electricity .
the piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long str@@ ings of stuff and fol@@ ded it up to put it in the wa@@ ste@@ bas@@ ket .
everybody who smo@@ kes knows it &apos;s not good for you , and still 30 percent of americans smo@@ ke -- 80 percent in some parts of the world . why do people do it ?
think about bi@@ tter@@ sweet cho@@ col@@ ate ; or think about the aci@@ di@@ ty of yo@@ gur@@ t -- wonderful -- mix@@ ed with stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry fru@@ its .
this is mor@@ oc@@ co last year in the at@@ las mountains , training in prepar@@ ation for some high altitude jump@@ s .
and then everyone was up on the roof , so i ran up there .
i managed to convin@@ ce him that it was important for us , but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .
and that is , that when they analy@@ zed the diet pep@@ s@@ i data , they were asking the wrong question .
it &apos;s very difficult for a politi@@ cian , because you &apos;re afraid that many lives have been lost in va@@ in .
i discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ el ka@@ hn : if he did he was a very lucky man .
and mat@@ thi@@ e@@ u &apos;s happiness measure is off the charts .
to discover compassion , you need to be com@@ passionate .
or even &quot; french . &quot;
and actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
this is where the village used to be .
and what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypo@@ th@@ es@@ es in the space of two minutes .
but if we did this in every single -- every fire hy@@ dr@@ ant we could re@@ define the emergen@@ cy .
is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compe@@ te ?
for example , the great oxford histori@@ an who taught here at this university , a@@ .@@ j@@ .@@ p@@ . taylor , defined a great power as a country able to pre@@ va@@ il in war .
there &apos;s a beautiful quote by the roman@@ tic ger@@ man com@@ pos@@ er robert sch@@ um@@ ann , who said , &quot; to send light into the dar@@ k@@ ness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the du@@ ty of the artist . &quot;
it &apos;s a very natural sense .
the slum built on the ra@@ il@@ road reser@@ vation between the sea and the ra@@ il@@ road tra@@ cks was completely swe@@ pt away .
so every time , i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem , and so i got over the problem .
so i will par@@ ap@@ hrase einstein in clo@@ sing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terri@@ fying and won@@ dr@@ ous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential partici@@ pants in lingu@@ i@@ stically and cultur@@ ally ac@@ cept@@ able for@@ mat@@ s .
at ted , brilli@@ ance is ra@@ mp@@ ant .
you can see the range of the coast red@@ woods . it &apos;s here , in red .
bo@@ o he@@ wer@@ d@@ ine , thomas dol@@ by , thank you very much for invi@@ ting me . it &apos;s been a bl@@ ess@@ ing singing for you .
so what were these used for ?
it &apos;s just fab@@ ul@@ ous .
i mean , today , one person speaking can be seen by millions , she@@ dding bright light on po@@ tent ideas , creating inten@@ se desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case , inten@@ se desire to lau@@ gh .
we think of a bunch of red@@ ne@@ cks , quote , un@@ quote , with g@@ uns .
but terrorists aren &apos;t the only threat we face .
this happens to be income and as@@ sets versus the size of the company as den@@ ot@@ ed by its number of emplo@@ ye@@ es .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has weak@@ n@@ esses , who has fla@@ ws , who is maybe not immediately lik@@ able , but eventually rel@@ at@@ able .
and the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization , and off@@ er to our children the possibility to inv@@ ent a new story , a new poe@@ try , a new roman@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm .
we were a little bit rat@@ tled .
the first occurred because the do@@ d@@ gers &apos; cat@@ cher , ro@@ y cam@@ pan@@ ella , came to my home@@ town of rock@@ ville cent@@ re , long island , just as i was in prepar@@ ation for my first hol@@ y communi@@ on .
but we also include , what we call , the slow vari@@ ables , the systems that , under the hood , regu@@ late and bu@@ ff@@ er the capacity of the resili@@ ence of the planet -- the inter@@ ference of the big ni@@ tro@@ gen and phosphorus cycles on the planet , land use change , rate of bio@@ diversity loss , fres@@ h@@ water use , functions which regu@@ late biom@@ ass on the planet , carbon sequ@@ est@@ ration , diversity .
blin@@ ker@@ ed vision ten@@ ds to produce , i think , blin@@ ker@@ ed solutions .
and when you &apos;re training for this sport , you are not smi@@ ling .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilome@@ ters away , soon it become like this .
the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range exten@@ sion .
and so i came back with that news to cam@@ bridge , and bra@@ g@@ g said , &quot; build models . &quot;
let me conclu@@ de with this picture .
almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
takes over as the leading nation in the year 19@@ 00 , when the line swi@@ t@@ ches to red .
now we have to coun@@ ter that , though , against the evidence we &apos;ve heard that we might have had some rather di@@ sta@@ ste@@ ful genetic d@@ alli@@ an@@ ces with the ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als and the deni@@ so@@ v@@ ans .
you just go to the website , fill out the form , give them $ 60 , and it arri@@ ves in the post .
he said , &quot; how often do you make these horri@@ ble wi@@ shes ? &quot;
and when the arm disappe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pain disappe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pain flo@@ ating out there , in space .
right ?
nobody in the obama campaig@@ n had ever tried to hi@@ de the group or make it har@@ der to join , to den@@ y its exist@@ ence , to d@@ ele@@ te it , to take to off the site .
so we bought her a je@@ ep . and in the year that she had the je@@ ep , she saved 4@@ ,@@ 500 girls from being cut . so then we said to her , &quot; ag@@ nes , well , what else could we do for you ? &quot; and she said , &quot; well , eve , you know , if you gave me some money , i could open a house and girls could run away and they could be saved . &quot;
people -- people talk lou@@ dly -- i &apos;m so sorry .
sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her be@@ ad shop in london .
and i thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s the stru@@ g@@ gle ? &quot;
on a larger scale , this is a mas@@ h@@ -up of the data which was released about the afgh@@ an elections .
so the re@@ actions in the street were kind of interesting .
joel le@@ vine : this is a la@@ unch from the kennedy space center in florida .
they &apos;re standing alone at the high school dance , and they &apos;ve never been k@@ is@@ sed .
i have no idea where the ne@@ ar@@ est food pan@@ try is .
he was caught by de@@ di@@ cated , resour@@ ce@@ ful , brilliant people in part@@ ner@@ ships with various technologies .
so here , diam@@ onds , hearts -- no , diam@@ onds . good , good .
from now on we count per capita .
till finally one prin@@ ce said , &quot; prin@@ cess , i accept , you have defe@@ ated me . &quot;
this is cin@@ dy van den bre@@ men , who is a du@@ tch designer that &apos;s done this series of cap@@ sters .
they &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life . but they &apos;re rather curi@@ ous , and i say this out of affe@@ ction for them .
and everything i saw in the cul@@ ti@@ vation said there were huge fi@@ ghts am@@ on@@ gst the fo@@ o@@ dies between the cul@@ tiv@@ ators and the h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ ers .
what the actor does with this information depen@@ ds on its policy , which is stor@@ ed in the str@@ eng@@ ths of the connection , between the od@@ or dete@@ ctors and the mot@@ ors that power the fly &apos;s ev@@ a@@ sive actions .
hi@@ ro@@ sh@@ i is@@ hi@@ i and his group at the mit media lab took a p@@ ing-@@ pon@@ g table and plac@@ ed a proje@@ ctor above it , and on the p@@ ing-@@ pon@@ g table they proje@@ cted an image of water with fish swimming in it .
blo@@ g@@ gers ex@@ posed this , or they worked hard to ex@@ pose this .
they don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very clou@@ dy anyway .
these are my mother &apos;s , at the top -- although that &apos;s not her car , it was car@@ ried there by f@@ loo@@ d@@ wat@@ ers up to the roof -- and that &apos;s my sister &apos;s , below .

you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to cor@@ ru@@ pt -- that it &apos;s transpar@@ ent .

now around cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , there are sc@@ at@@ tered g@@ ho@@ st villa@@ ges , e@@ eri@@ ly silent , str@@ angel@@ y char@@ ming , bu@@ co@@ lic , totally cont@@ am@@ inated .
vi@@ agr@@ a , right ? why ? because a lot of guys need it .
the four countries have no access to facebook .
so i went out , colle@@ cted the du@@ ck , and before i put it in the free@@ zer , i che@@ cked if the victi@@ m was indeed of the male sex .
when you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone , the room would be very crow@@ ded .
but we &apos;re nowhere near the end@@ game when it comes to our per@@ ception .
now i &apos;m going to put the plan@@ k 300 feet in the air -- and i &apos;m not going to go near it , thank you .
just read where those guys are from .
i can &apos;t feel my li@@ ps ; my face is fro@@ zen ; i can &apos;t feel my hands ; i can &apos;t feel my feet .

then , when i gradu@@ ated from cal@@ tech , the i@@ b@@ m p@@ .@@ c. came out , and i got addi@@ cted to the i@@ b@@ m p@@ .@@ c. in 198@@ 1 .
now you &apos;ve finished the lens , you literally pop it out .
now this region , it has just five percent of its forests left in@@ t@@ act . five percent .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in dis@@ cre@@ et sub-@@ species or categ@@ ories . &quot;
however , it &apos;s illegal to broad@@ cast al@@ hur@@ ra within the united states .
because we &apos;d all be ga@@ y then .
and then we invi@@ ted people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
so this is a huge practi@@ cal problem .
and i &apos;m rob@@ bie , and i &apos;m 14 , and i play the fi@@ ddle .
also , we have a window of opportunity , because the brain is mal@@ le@@ able for just so long , and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life .
here &apos;s how shape works in normal re@@ cept@@ ors .
but of course , once you are that far , you &apos;re not really sa@@ tis@@ fied .
i remember when they took the apple ma@@ c interface and they put it back on the apple i@@ i .
and there are two essential elements of it : we have to simpli@@ fy the law .
we conven@@ tion@@ ally divi@@ de space into private and public real@@ ms , and we know these legal di@@ stin@@ ctions very well because we &apos;ve become experts at prote@@ cting our private proper@@ ty and private space .
and after she did this four or five times , she swa@@ m by me with this de@@ je@@ cted look on her face .
neither one of those yo@@ ung@@ sters could shoot very well .
anybody interested in that ?
what parts of you are just being seen ?
collabor@@ ates with anim@@ ator andrew park to illu@@ stra@@ te den@@ is du@@ tt@@ on &apos;s pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive theory on beauty -- that art , music and other beautiful things , far from being simply &quot; in the eye of the be@@ hol@@ der , &quot; are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary ori@@ g@@ ins .
our study &quot; is an im@@ pression of the moon &apos;s surface .
it was gone . they took my pro model off the shelf , which was essentially pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ cing you dead publi@@ c@@ ly .

it was something very similar to the phase transition that occur@@ s when water turns into ice below zero degrees .
most people find that very so@@ o@@ thing , and , interest@@ ingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequ@@ ency of the breathing of a sle@@ e@@ ping human .

i realize that &apos;s an ambi@@ gu@@ ous stat@@ ement .
the real key obser@@ vation he made is that a fre@@ e-@@ flying wing can swe@@ ep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fix@@ e@@ d-@@ wing turb@@ ine .
now finally , we can measure earth &apos;s energy im@@ balance preci@@ sely by meas@@ uring the heat content in earth &apos;s heat reser@@ vo@@ irs .
so this mu@@ tu@@ al inspiration pro@@ mot@@ es collabor@@ ation , initiative and creativity .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it doesn &apos;t cap@@ ture our imagination as a society .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
we consider this to be sort of the spirit of ted .
a@@ ar@@ gh !
well , an@@ ne frank tou@@ ched millions with her powerful accoun@@ t of the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st , ru@@ by bri@@ d@@ ges helped to end se@@ gre@@ g@@ ation in the united states , and , most recently , charlie simp@@ son helped to raise 1@@ 20,000 pounds for haiti on his little bike .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
head in@@ ju@@ ries are bad for you . they lead to parkinson &apos;s disease .
ok . so , how many car@@ ds ? five ? zo@@ e : four .
this is from so@@ vi@@ et union . attra@@ ctive .
this message is given as a public service .
it &apos;s a &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; kind of thing .
they report that israeli@@ s who had never been active before , upon seeing the film , understand the power of non@@ violence and start jo@@ ining their ac@@ tivi@@ ties .
so just imagine : one day very soon , you &apos;re going to be able to plan a tri@@ p down@@ town and your car will be connected to a smart parking system .
in por@@ tu@@ ges@@ e , it means &quot; shu@@ t your mouth , gal@@ vao . &quot;
they &apos;re thinking about the same things .
hiv is a serious problem in the d@@ r con@@ go , and aid agen@@ cies have f@@ loo@@ ded the country with free and cheap condoms . but few people are using them . why ? &quot; re@@ formed mar@@ ke@@ ter &quot; amy lo@@ ck@@ wood off@@ ers a surprising answer that u@@ pen@@ ds a traditional model of phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ py .
and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .
that distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet recei@@ ves overall .
a few of these . this is ati@@ ll@@ a the hen .
sa@@ dly , in the next 18 minutes when i do our ch@@ at , four americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , suddenly mana@@ ges to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are saf@@ ely home .
what are you eating ?
i &apos;m not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital na@@ tives .
s@@ b : well , research on progeri@@ a has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeri@@ a , and it shows that if that drive exists , anybody can cure any disease , and hop@@ efully progeri@@ a can be cu@@ red in the near future , and so we can elimin@@ ate those 4,000 diseases that francis was talking about .
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te what that did and do things very differently .
and in addition to that , we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future , a say we haven &apos;t even really started to hear yet -- china , india , russia , south africa and ben@@ ki &apos;s own brazi@@ l , where ben@@ ki got his civil rights only in the 198@@ 8 con@@ stitu@@ tion .
but then we hit a new challenge , and that &apos;s the number of skil@@ led prosthe@@ ti@@ sts who are able to fit kne@@ es .
my un@@ cle ed gave me a beautiful blue swe@@ ater -- at least i thought it was beautiful .
why is it right to encoura@@ ge lea@@ king of secret information ?
7@@ 8 percent of the vot@@ es , and to give you an idea of the land@@ slide , the next highest name pulled in three . okay ?
here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
it &apos;s a fu@@ cking or@@ gy ! &quot;
so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go sh@@ opp@@ ing .
my own way of dealing with it was to become a mon@@ k .
ks : now the reason it &apos;s cold is that &apos;s it &apos;s not actually water loaded into these squ@@ ir@@ t g@@ uns -- it &apos;s a dr@@ y li@@ qu@@ id developed by 3@@ m .
so it kind of cool@@ ed my te@@ st-@@ driving for a little while .
and although breast density generally de@@ clin@@ es with age , up to a third of women re@@ tain dense breast tissue for years after men@@ op@@ ause .
about half a cent a day to run .
what does the system look like ?
and the door to my x-@@ ray room is made of lead and steel .
of course , you have to ask yourself , why on earth was such a list never done before ?

so for her graduate work , she did a three-@@ part series on the mur@@ der of 11 women found bu@@ ried on al@@ bu@@ quer@@ que &apos;s west mes@@ a .
so these are a few images i was lucky to take and be there .
they all work like this kan@@ gar@@ o@@ o , they boun@@ ce .
then some dro@@ id in the back puts the name on a tick@@ ler and says , &quot; oh , this is an important letter . &quot;
ab@@ ed and i s@@ at with our coffee .
recently i visited belo@@ it , wis@@ consi@@ n .
are you thinking of something physical or som@@ thing tan@@ gi@@ ble as you design it ?
fortunately , more and more institutions are imple@@ ment@@ ing the more holi@@ stic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introdu@@ ced to the field of so@@ und@@ sc@@ ape ecolo@@ gy .
so , we line them all up so they go together around the mean@@ ing@@ ful points , integr@@ ated across everything we know about the patient .
this is surprising , of course , because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa .
and then i began to ask the rever@@ se question .
je : well , that might change a couple things . thank you .
i said , &quot; is that thing real ? &quot;
we need to face our fe@@ ars and take back our streets , our cities , our neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
you say it .
in fact , when i saw &quot; super@@ size me , &quot; i starting thinking of saying , what would happen if an individual had 3@@ 1 days non@@ stop fo@@ x news ?
so i te@@ amed up with my good friend ri@@ car@@ do cab@@ ello , also known as mr. do@@ ob , who &apos;s a much better program@@ mer than i am , and he made this amazing fl@@ ash dra@@ wing tool .
another place i &apos;d like to share with you is the zab@@ bal@@ e@@ en in ca@@ ir@@ o .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very pro@@ sper@@ ous , and thus use a lot of stuff .
there &apos;s been a lot of talk about nar@@ ra@@ tive in africa .
it &apos;s a finite resource ; it &apos;s always dra@@ ining away .
a lot of sexu@@ ality education that happens today is so influ@@ enced by the bas@@ e@@ ball model , and it sets up education that can &apos;t help but produce un@@ healthy sexu@@ ality in young people .
we have sold things all over the world , from ethi@@ opia to turkey to u.s. to wh@@ er@@ ever .
vision is one of the best things we do .
and what you should know about african penguins is that they have raz@@ or@@ -@@ sharp bea@@ ks .
public accoun@@ t@@ ability needs to be pro@@ mot@@ ed through transpar@@ ency and independent re@@ view by non@@ govern@@ mental and international organizations as appropriate .
but don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
so mary ro@@ bin@@ son , she said to me , &quot; listen , this is an idea whose time has come . this must be created . &quot;
now i don &apos;t know where you guys were , but i was in my living room . it was practi@@ cally a religious ev@@ ent .
because just that soil could make the ac@@ ou@@ stic difference .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
figh@@ t-@@ or@@ -@@ flight fear swe@@ at , because i tried ball@@ room dan@@ cing in college -- ste@@ pped on the girl &apos;s foot with my he@@ el . she scre@@ amed .
that in the recycl@@ ing work that i was doing , i &apos;m looking for a practice , a human activity that is sustainable .
see , cru@@ cial point here : math is not equal to calcul@@ ating .
but you have heard how bi@@ op@@ h@@ oni@@ es help cl@@ ari@@ fy our understanding of the natural world .
and the network really matters .
she was very t@@ all , i would say .
the first was that i grew up with no religion at all .
the brain is the record of the feelings of a life .
inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously , every civili@@ an gps recei@@ ver around the globe went from er@@ r@@ ors the size of a foot@@ ball field to er@@ r@@ ors the size of a small room .
richard ser@@ ra had to let go of painting in order to embar@@ k on this pla@@ yful explor@@ ation that led him to the work that he &apos;s known for today : huge cur@@ ves of steel that requi@@ re our time and motion to experience . in sculp@@ ture , richard ser@@ ra is able to do what he couldn &apos;t do in painting .
and polio er@@ adi@@ cation , in many ways , is even t@@ ough@@ er , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
and this is one of those initi@@ ates .
au@@ di cla@@ im@@ ed it &apos;s going to beat them both by a year .
so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags , i then thought i &apos;d invest 7@@ .@@ 95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in kil@@ ru@@ sh for a mo@@ p hand@@ le and even less money on some o@@ ven cle@@ an@@ ers .

so much more energy can be stor@@ ed with fuel than with batter@@ ies .
here we see people that feel &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; n@@ au@@ se@@ ous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
i know some of you are just , you know , b@@ ing@@ o ! or , i don &apos;t know .
and based on david &apos;s ini@@ tial pro@@ mis@@ ing results , which were paid with seed fun@@ ds at mit , i was able to attra@@ ct major research funding from the private se@@ ctor and the feder@@ al government .
art , in the plat@@ oni@@ c sense , is truth ; it &apos;s beauty , and love .
their pl@@ um@@ bing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
and in the last two to three su@@ mm@@ ers , these inv@@ a@@ sive organ@@ isms , this kind of e@@ b@@ ol@@ a of the trees , as it were , has swe@@ pt through the pri@@ me@@ val hem@@ lock forest of the east , and has absolutely wi@@ ped it out . i clim@@ bed there this past summer .
i know your dad never paid attention , even when you made c@@ f@@ o . &quot;
k@@ abi@@ r , ra@@ him , all the great su@@ fi sa@@ in@@ ts , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason .
well , under the categ@@ ory of &quot; what &apos;s the har@@ m of sil@@ ly stuff like this ? &quot;
there are these other identi@@ ties which you have to learn from a pe@@ er group .
they said , &quot; these two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; grand@@ mothers ? &quot; the minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organ@@ isms was something that held incredible a@@ we for us .
but as ridiculous as that sounds , that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in our classrooms right now .
and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world , then it &apos;s absolutely central to society .
and if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them out@@ wards , then i really think we have something quite revol@@ ution@@ ary on our hands .
there are people who are mi@@ mi@@ cking the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ harv@@ est@@ ing device inside of purple bac@@ teri@@ um , the people at as@@ u . even more interesting , l@@ ately , in the last couple of weeks , people have seen that there &apos;s an enzy@@ me called hydro@@ gen@@ ase that &apos;s able to evolve hydrogen from pro@@ ton and elec@@ tr@@ ons , and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what &apos;s happening in a fuel cell , in the ano@@ de of a fuel cell and in a rever@@ sible fuel cell .
but one thing that psych@@ ologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vi@@ vi@@ dly .
it was something i read in an edi@@ t@@ ori@@ al by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from dro@@ w@@ ning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jump@@ ed out of in the beginning , but these are posi@@ tions , the lat@@ est posi@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system .
or the op-@@ ed page , where if they knew the edi@@ tor -- had been to school with him , sle@@ pt with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-@@ ed page .
by comb@@ ining tissue engineering techniques with micro@@ flu@@ i@@ di@@ cs , the field is actually evol@@ ving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your li@@ ver or an anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant might affect your heart .
and so what i &apos;m going to try to do today is to sha@@ ke your confidence . because i know the feeling -- i can feel it myself .
what i discovered in these inter@@ i@@ ors is that there was a dis@@ connect between the ex@@ teri@@ or sh@@ ell and the inter@@ ior architecture of the pieces .
it &apos;s a piece of plastic with a radio sha@@ ck anten@@ na atta@@ ched to it .
so architecture maybe is not so big , like science , but through its fo@@ cal point it can le@@ verage in an archi@@ medi@@ an way what we think the world is really about .
the dog says , &quot; i don &apos;t think so . &quot;
of course , you and i know that co@@ ke is the better choice .
this is what i saw .
there are tons of other things that we should think about doing .
in fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
i hope that you will all , if you &apos;ve been moved by this present@@ ation , join with the growing international community to get canada to step up to its respon@@ sibilities , to convin@@ ce canada to go back to being a climate change champi@@ on instead of a climate change villa@@ in , and to say no to the tar sands , and yes to a clean energy future for all .
didn &apos;t notice them .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyrami@@ d , there is the man .
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have sever@@ e , profound if you will , implications to her family .
and this is pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful z@@ am@@ bia , neighbor@@ ing country -- 15 percent .
you can get a mer@@ ce@@ des for a very high price , very high performance .
these were cri@@ min@@ als , th@@ u@@ gs , dangerous , destro@@ ying their own environment .
i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys .
this picture was taken from an or@@ bi@@ ting satellite .
and that &apos;s actually rather useful for for@@ en@@ si@@ cs and so on .
the com@@ man@@ der told me that a woman could g@@ auge a poten@@ tially violent situation much better than men .
and there are only seven of them .
and all of a sudden we were talking about arms control , and she said , &quot; well i feel we should do this . &quot;
as we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essentially bac@@ king up into the past .
thank you very much .
so here &apos;s some of the charac@@ ters that we have .
but for us to get them , not only do we pus@@ h ourselves , but we live by certain rules of engagement , which mean we can &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere .
this person studies all the &quot; ar@@ gh@@ s , &quot; from one through eight a &apos;s .
and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance , to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from un@@ reali@@ stic opti@@ mis@@ m , but at the same time re@@ main hop@@ e@@ ful .
but the truth is i &apos;ve spent every wa@@ king minute nearly since then ch@@ as@@ ing that vision .
and the exciting thing is it &apos;s starting to grow .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
so i pres@@ ented those results at the international science fair , which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life .
and that &apos;s the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
and basically on hospital day eight , that &apos;s when they called us .
the third thing , and this is what wor@@ ries me the most , is the ex@@ tent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global pl@@ u@@ to@@ cra@@ cy also happen to be hol@@ lo@@ wing out the middle class in western industri@@ alized economi@@ es .
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 -- their mou@@ ths are wat@@ ering at this point .
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
something else is , because if that doesn &apos;t survive , we are not here ; there are no mamm@@ als . it &apos;s that close ; one species e@@ kes through .
and the lo@@ ser is un@@ re@@ conc@@ iled .
we are actually trying to measure this profi@@ le and to detect th@@ ori@@ um .
it &apos;s often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
so if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law .
k@@ b : you did feel that ? what did you feel ?
and he said , &quot; well , i won &apos;t define the vehicle for you , but i will define the cost for you .
my lingu@@ i@@ stics and economi@@ cs colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really expl@@ ore and understand the ways that these sub@@ tle nu@@ d@@ ges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
when the mobile telephone companies invented sms , they had no idea what it was for ; it was only when that technology got into the hands of teen@@ age users that they invented the use .
now , when i was here at the first ted , i showed this photograph : two men of the el@@ der brothers , the des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts , survi@@ vor@@ s of el dor@@ a@@ do .
and then , of course , they were used by extremi@@ sts and politi@@ cians on the other side .
it &apos;s a thin film , two-@@ dimensional exist@@ ence .
she makes about two dollars a day , is creating an education fund , and told me she is not mar@@ rying nor having children until these things are comple@@ ted .
if i &apos;m violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just dis@@ gu@@ ise my violence .
the third part is a computer simulation of that machine , and the last part is to physi@@ cally build it at the science museum .
and this isn &apos;t just tom frie@@ d@@ man , it &apos;s actually pro@@ vable in case after case after case .
and my father smi@@ led and said , &quot; well , you know what that means , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
in short , we have no con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
fur@@ ther@@ more it says , &quot; start time . &quot;
&quot; i took my gir@@ l@@ friend out for dinner .
and we &apos;ve actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cu@@ bes .
this is a klein bot@@ tle wine bot@@ tle , which , although in four dimen@@ sions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfe@@ ctly capable of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al dimen@@ sions .
he has a telephone bo@@ oth .
actually you take any object co@@ ated with fig ju@@ ice and the ants will carry them back to the nest .
in order to program them , you have to understand si@@ x-@@ dimensional ve@@ ctors and qu@@ at@@ erni@@ ons .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
it was cam@@ us who once said that , &quot; man is the only species who re@@ f@@ uses to be what he really is . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take these two symmetri@@ cal objects here .
it knows the be@@ aring home , and it knows it should be in that direction .
well , i say yes , and if there is , i give the prize to darwin .
and syste@@ mi@@ cally what we will show , across a series of studies , is that you , the pas@@ sen@@ gers , even though the tea was picked for you at random , will end up sol@@ ving more puzz@@ les than you , the dri@@ vers .
subur@@ ban expansion to cheap land , for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped gener@@ ations of families enjoy the american dream .
here &apos;s cal@@ ab@@ ash@@ es that is@@ sa was just showing us , and they &apos;re stac@@ ked re@@ cur@@ si@@ vely .
well , i &apos;m involved in other things , besi@@ des physics .
but that four@@ th chapter always ends with an execu@@ tion .
all right , let me then finish off with four general stat@@ ements , an example and two a@@ ph@@ or@@ isms .
po@@ op can co@@ ok your dinner .
that &apos;s truth number two about lying .
to make things worse , you can just see the white do@@ t up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that &apos;s a full moon .
and here , the first thing you can see is that this building , the roof is a very warm kind of over@@ co@@ at blan@@ ket , a kind of in@@ sul@@ ating garden , which is also about the celebra@@ tion of public space .
i don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
so we say , in general , that there &apos;s a symme@@ try under certain oper@@ ations if those oper@@ ations leave the phenomenon , or its descri@@ ption , un@@ changed .
but once you fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ate happiness the way i do -- not just positive emotion , that &apos;s not nearly enough -- there &apos;s flow in life , and there &apos;s meaning in life .
mostly , people want to see their old stuff out of this .
another major revolution : the communi@@ cations revolution .
so i went out and i started with the kids .
thank you all very much .
we are nearly on the edge of a crisis , but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and , in fact , of our century .
thank you .
now , it wasn &apos;t as if there was a few bad app@@ les -- a few people che@@ ated a lot .
it isn &apos;t .
it is , in theory , the global com@@ mon@@ s , belon@@ ging to us all .
but all that belief had fu@@ el@@ ed me so long .
how about this -- &quot; god designed this planet &apos;s environment just so we could live in it . &quot;
this is page 4@@ 7@@ 4 on your pa@@ per@@ bac@@ ks if you &apos;re following along : &quot; though it was getting better , i still wasn &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ fied with the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral address .
he said that one of the reasons he invented be@@ bo@@ p was that he was pretty sure that white musi@@ cians wouldn &apos;t be able to repli@@ cate the sound .
and the response to that is that we dem@@ and the exerci@@ se of thinking from every san@@ e person .
if you had caught me straight out of college in the hall@@ s of the ver@@ mon@@ t state house where i was a lob@@ by@@ ist in training and asked me what i was going to do with my life , i would have told you that i &apos;d just passed the h@@ any@@ u shu@@ i@@ ping ka@@ o@@ sh@@ i , the chinese equi@@ val@@ ency ex@@ am , and i was going to go study law in beijing , and i was going to improve u.s.@@ -@@ china rela@@ tions through top-@@ down policy changes and ju@@ di@@ cial system re@@ forms .
but for the time being , thank you for that .
in a way , it did not for me .
it &apos;s mi@@ d-@@ morning , the place is fil@@ ling up .
but other countries in europe , not@@ ably the nor@@ di@@ c countries , are showing that it &apos;s possible to have a ki@@ ck@@ -@@ ass economy without being a wor@@ ka@@ ho@@ lic .
so all these things are determined by the ba@@ ker , and the bread goes through some sta@@ ges , and charac@@ ters develop .
and even though the police can be a little anno@@ ying at times -- giving us tick@@ ets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
just as we ru@@ sh in .
i really app@@ lau@@ d the seti eff@@ or@@ ts , but we have not heard anything yet .
often , we think we &apos;re doing a good thing .
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and i &apos;m sure have wonderful families and children and grand@@ children , it &apos;s not enough . you &apos;ve got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cru@@ z who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you ment@@ or , if you invest in boys and girls clu@@ bs , if you work with your school system , make sure it &apos;s the best school system , and not just your kid &apos;s school , but the school up@@ town in har@@ le@@ m , not just down@@ town mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i on the west side .
they share their designs .
but we &apos;re here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice car@@ to@@ ons .
ak : you want to say something about the breathing ?
it &apos;s like the guy is sitting next to you , whi@@ sp@@ ering who knows what into your e@@ ar .
so that basically meant there were 35 men for me that i could possibly date in the entire city of philadelphia .
toyota , instead of treating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a market@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
and this gives us a tan@@ gi@@ ble model of the three-@@ dimensional protein and how it fol@@ ds and all of the intri@@ c@@ ac@@ ies of the ge@@ ome@@ try .
we &apos;re going to re@@ program the bac@@ teria in your gut , and we &apos;re going to make your po@@ o smell like pep@@ per@@ min@@ t . &quot;
if you spend five minutes with somebody , you start looking beyond their faci@@ al appe@@ ar@@ ance , and the people who you &apos;re initially attra@@ cted to may seem bor@@ ing and you lose interest in them , and the people who you didn &apos;t immediately se@@ ek out , because you didn &apos;t find them particularly attra@@ ctive , become attra@@ ctive people because of their person@@ ality .
we need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
seti researcher se@@ th sho@@ sta@@ k be@@ ts that we will find ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al life in the next tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ four years , or he &apos;ll buy you a c@@ up of coffee . at tedx@@ san@@ jose@@ ca , he explains why new technologies and the la@@ ws of prob@@ ability make the break@@ through so likely -- and fore@@ ca@@ sts how the discovery of civili@@ zations far more advanced than ours might affect us here on earth . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and other people go and fill them in .
in fact , we ate so many sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es i became orange with sweet po@@ ta@@ to .
we only sell you air@@ time .
they use mo@@ bu@@ tu as metaphor .
sr@@ d@@ ja po@@ po@@ vi@@ c : how to top@@ ple a di@@ ct@@ ator
well let &apos;s take a look at something like au@@ ti@@ sm inci@@ dence per thousand .
this is fi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ o li@@ pp@@ i &apos;s 15@@ 4@@ 3 por@@ tra@@ it of sa@@ int apoll@@ oni@@ a .
it &apos;s not hyper@@ bo@@ le to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alterna@@ tives to the taliban .
in africa -- where it is a major kil@@ ler -- it is totally ignor@@ ed .
so when we would look at cells , this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscop@@ e .
and i went on vac@@ ation with my parents to the jer@@ sey sh@@ ore .
a child can navi@@ gate with an x@@ box controll@@ er or a game controll@@ er .
the pilot made this great obser@@ vation : &quot; that &apos;s hot . &quot;
us .
so that &apos;s great because then we can go and study them -- re@@ mot@@ ely , of course -- with all the techniques that we already have te@@ sted in the past five years .
so what do they do ?
although , listening to kevin kel@@ ly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
if this were bat@@ tle@@ star gal@@ ac@@ ti@@ ca and you &apos;re fighting the cy@@ l@@ ons , don &apos;t hi@@ de behind the black hole .
this disease was terri@@ fying .
the opposite of play is depression . it &apos;s depression .
if i make the fla@@ ps s@@ kin@@ ni@@ er , i can use a bit less paper .
english mother : ah , i love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice .
so , what other words might be used to smooth the path , oil the whe@@ els , sugar the p@@ ill ? darwin himself prefer@@ red &quot; agno@@ stic &quot; -- and not only out of loy@@ al@@ ty to his friend hu@@ x@@ ley , who co@@ ined the term .
&quot; can the brain build such a per@@ ception ? &quot;
well , now we know that au@@ ti@@ sm is this dis@@ ruption , the dis@@ ruption of this reson@@ ance that i am telling you .
we get je@@ al@@ ous , not because we &apos;re evil , but because we have little artists p@@ ent up inside us .
that two of the hot@@ test cars in the united states is a 5@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ dollar giant car , big enough to hold a min@@ i in its tr@@ unk .
in 198@@ 6 , i moved to r@@ wand@@ a , and i worked with a very small group of r@@ wand@@ an women to start that country &apos;s first micro@@ fin@@ ance bank .
well , they came up with three very general cri@@ teria . first is -- and they &apos;re li@@ sted here .
we want to neu@@ tr@@ ali@@ ze the ten@@ sions . we want clo@@ sen@@ ess .
and so we build for it in africa first and then we move to the ed@@ ges .
so the amount of money online crime gener@@ ates is significant .
and we &apos;ll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe .

phy@@ lli@@ s ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez and ai@@ cha el-@@ wa@@ fi have a powerful friend@@ ship born of un@@ thin@@ k@@ able loss . ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez &apos; son was killed in the world trade center attac@@ ks on september 11 , 200@@ 1 ; el-@@ wa@@ fi &apos;s son zac@@ ari@@ as m@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was con@@ vi@@ cted of a role in those attac@@ ks and is ser@@ ving a life sent@@ ence . in hoping to find peace , these two mom@@ s have come to understand and respect one another .
i want to compe@@ te .
and then , i also wasn &apos;t really sh@@ ining in a certain area that i wanted to be , and you know , you look at those sc@@ or@@ es , and it wasn &apos;t bad , but it was not certainly predi@@ ctive that i would one day make my living out of the ar@@ t@@ ful arran@@ gement of words .
we couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
this is the true experience of a live conc@@ ert .
and car@@ l norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the for@@ mer camp .
and there &apos;s very illegal hu@@ st@@ les , which you s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle in , you get s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ed in , drugs , por@@ no@@ graphy , cell phones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a risk@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the risk@@ i@@ er the enter@@ prise , the more profi@@ table it can poten@@ tially be .
space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is acceler@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see .
the electricity is free .
every single one of these guys , you look at them , you can see a sil@@ hou@@ ette of them , and you realize , like , &quot; oh , that &apos;s him , that &apos;s has@@ la@@ m , that &apos;s ko@@ ston , there &apos;s these guys , these are the guys .
and almost a kind of pol@@ ter@@ geist effect .
we could avoid about 50@@ 0,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infe@@ cted every year .
all of this could wi@@ pe out the sa@@ vings we &apos;re hoping to make in the first place .
just like race car dri@@ vers can use all of the fri@@ ction between the ti@@ re and the road , all of the car &apos;s cap@@ abilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those cap@@ abilities to avoid any accident we can .
you can &apos;t get rid of waste .

this model is all about choices , both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regu@@ late climate on the long term , in our forests , land and bio@@ diversity .
you &apos;ve got to know your area .
it &apos;s the thing that di@@ st@@ ingu@@ i@@ shes the pu@@ ppe@@ t -- ak : o@@ ops .

but mur@@ ray g@@ ell@@ -@@ mann yesterday talked about emergen@@ t properties ; another name for them could be &quot; architecture &quot; as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-@@ obvious , non-@@ simple ways of comb@@ ining it .
and you can see it against the boun@@ dar@@ ies of modern china .
and so it turns out that me@@ than@@ e is to titan what water is to the earth .
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s pengu@@ in sh@@ it . &quot;
ah , yes , there is .
it &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
the first time the possibility for indepen@@ dence was disc@@ us@@ sed was in 19@@ 2@@ 2 , following the ab@@ a women &apos;s market ri@@ ots .
think about it for a second : there is no standard google any@@ more .
right ? so this is the first example .
bru@@ ce bu@@ en@@ o de mes@@ qui@@ ta : i &apos;ve thought about that , and since i &apos;ve done a lot of work for the intelligence community , they &apos;ve also pon@@ der@@ ed that .
tw@@ enty years ago , in a conference richard and i were at together , i wrote a po@@ em , which seems to me to still hold for me today .
but now this has some refle@@ c@@ tional symme@@ try .
and it must feel the water of the sea .
in a very short period of time , completely changed the atmosphere and character with l@@ oud voices and large bodies and such , and we had to get up and leave ; it was just that un@@ com@@ fort@@ able .
ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation , integration , coming together , leads to a new ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance .
now it &apos;s about you , the player , telling the story .
immedi@@ ate dete@@ ction , immedi@@ ate response .
they target poor families and convin@@ ce the parents to send their children .
for example , we use a lot of carbon@@ -@@ fi@@ ber com@@ posi@@ tes in spor@@ ting goo@@ ds .
it &apos;s the best way to shu@@ t people down on an airplane .
you don &apos;t have to have enough units to power your entire house , you just save money with each incre@@ mental one you add .
everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; yes . &quot;
but my idea today is not to de@@ ba@@ te whether there &apos;s such a thing as good tv or bad tv ; my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a con@@ science .
when i find myself in a conver@@ sa@@ tional situation , i need to type fast and to ju@@ mp right in .
i mean , we have arti@@ cles called &quot; on taking yourself seri@@ ously : how to not care what people think of you , &quot; but we also have arti@@ cles like , o@@ ops -- i &apos;m fig@@ uring it out !
it did die , and we su@@ spe@@ ct it was from the free@@ zing winter ni@@ ghts .
we then have these co@@ ders look at these ta@@ pes , four of them .
that &apos;s my father .

she was in a great ev@@ ening go@@ wn .
a fish can &apos;t do anything to a cro@@ w . &quot;
he showed him , &quot; you know , we don &apos;t have to do this wrong .
inter@@ activity was another thing .
because we &apos;ve only dou@@ bled the population of the earth since the 196@@ 0s -- a little more than dou@@ bled -- but we have 6@@ .@@ 7 billion people in the world , and we all like to con@@ sume .
here , what &apos;s spre@@ ading from person to person is not a behavior , but rather a norm : an idea is spre@@ ading .
so , techni@@ cally , it &apos;s a little bit complex , but it gives you an out@@ put which is more intui@@ tive to use , in some sense .
because what happened in the beginning , this stuff en@@ cases itself in a cell , then cells start han@@ ging out together in societies .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
90 percent of the funding came from th@@ a@@ il@@ and .
i mean , 90 percent of the population will watch nollywood .
what did you get ?
you could count them in five minutes .
they have to , in fact , make sure this ice never gets war@@ mer than about 20 degrees below zero , o@@ ther@@ wise , the key g@@ ases inside it will dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te .
this is not the place for hate and an@@ ger .
do you have your ring as well ?
that &apos;s okay , because check it out -- i have math to pro@@ ve that it is possible .
so we went back to these speci@@ men@@ s and we started di@@ gging around , and particularly we looked into the te@@ eth of skul@@ ls , hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fing@@ ers , and we found much better quality dna .
and i colle@@ cted those moments -- the photos inside google stre@@ et@@ view and the memor@@ ies , speci@@ fi@@ cally .
can a museum house artists and allow them to be change ag@@ ents as communities re@@ think themselves ?
there &apos;s a marker line called the tri@@ m line above our little red illu@@ stration there .
it &apos;s quite fashi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s broken .
musi@@ cian and researcher charles limb wondered how the brain works during musi@@ cal improvi@@ sation -- so he put ja@@ zz musi@@ cians and ra@@ p@@ pers in an f@@ mri to find out . what he and his team found has deep implications for our understanding of creativity of all kinds . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and they &apos;ll then decide when to do their street intervie@@ ws .
this not only lets you view twi@@ t@@ ters in different ways , but it introdu@@ ces new use cases as well .
and it would be easy to imple@@ ment and in@@ expensive .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
the name of the game is to get after your ene@@ my z@@ om@@ bie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
what &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
again , it &apos;s perfe@@ ctly safe for people . it puts out the fir@@ es , doesn &apos;t hur@@ t anything .
and i think that &apos;s just a horri@@ ble thing .
and i think , &quot; i &apos;m sitting next to le@@ wi@@ s pu@@ gh . &quot;
that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .
i might get one of those .
g@@ uns and bom@@ bs are nothing new .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; .
and then here &apos;s my favorite quote from one of the girls : &quot; men are the new ball and cha@@ in . &quot;
he says , &quot; fir@@ stly , you &apos;ve got to re@@ fu@@ se to give it all the ex@@ c@@ es@@ sive a@@ we and rever@@ ence it &apos;s been trained to recei@@ ve . &quot;
i would always be perfe@@ ctly co@@ i@@ ff@@ ed and well rested , and in fact , it was not like that at all .
well no , because if you think about it , if o@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and adam make two a@@ xes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
i want to rein@@ vent the deli@@ very system , and the use of car@@ d@@ board around the world , so they become ecolo@@ gi@@ cal foot@@ prin@@ ts .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m a great golfer .
and i thought i would do just one thing on the $ 100 laptop here just to pro@@ ve that this stuff works here .
but it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very dr@@ y world of pre@@ clinical basic science cancer research .
darwin had this amazing idea .
the man , his name was ma@@ hm@@ oud , and the child , whose name was ra@@ fi , left .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and expla@@ ined to me that what i did now in my shop was an an@@ ach@@ r@@ on@@ ism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
and to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only -- there is a transpar@@ ency between me and the story that i am creating .
and as it turns out , content matters a lot .
well with our technology , the surgeon is able to tell immediately which no@@ des have cancer .
and the water flo@@ ws through the city with time .
thank you .
there was he@@ mming and ha@@ wing and shu@@ ff@@ ling of feet , and then one of the white workers ste@@ pped forward and said , &quot; well , yeah . we &apos;ve looked at this place and there &apos;s only one place to sle@@ ep , there &apos;s only one place to eat , there &apos;s only one ba@@ th@@ room , there &apos;s only one water foun@@ tain . is this plant going to be integr@@ ated or what ? &quot;
very few things are very smooth .
take for example this e@@ mail i reci@@ ev@@ ed from a fi@@ re@@ figh@@ ter here in california .
it &apos;s not just in the poor world that po@@ op can save lives .
and then of course i have to milk the go@@ ats and feed the go@@ ats in order to make the che@@ ese .
but we &apos;re not done yet . because then how do we go from stage four , which is great , to stage five ?
so my 18 minutes is up .
and on the other side of the f@@ ence , that physical art , the physical performance of the stun@@ t@@ man , has inter@@ fac@@ ed with the very highest technology in i@@ .t. and in software .
well , if you are a liber@@ al , you say , &quot; hey , that &apos;s great ! &quot;
this is &quot; 6@@ ,@@ 500 yards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 yards , &quot; after ger@@ hard rich@@ ter .
and i want to tell you how this gun can help .
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen .
and that is what the copenhagen con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues .
and if it costs even a di@@ me to police a user , that will cru@@ sh a service with a hundred million users .
maybe there &apos;s an inno@@ c@@ ence to it .
when i first saw her , i thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
now , there are a few rela@@ tively exo@@ tic galaxies .
research into kids &apos; behavior actually suggests that it &apos;s worth taking ro@@ le-@@ playing seri@@ ously .
be@@ au aw@@ tin : safe in bed e@@ w : and our goal -- it was sort of an ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary goal -- there was an m@@ tv video where they all s@@ ang &quot; l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop &quot; and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little mel@@ o@@ dy .
and this inclu@@ des 5,000 pounds of mer@@ cur@@ y from our d@@ ental fil@@ l@@ ings alone every year .
i got a spli@@ t reaction to that during the live performance , because there is some people who understand live sub@@ ti@@ tles are a kind of an oxy@@ mor@@ on , because usually there is someone making them afterwards .
they took all of the trials which were sub@@ mitted to the f@@ da as part of the appro@@ val packa@@ ge .
i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i &apos;m talking about .
that &apos;s how most marketing is done , that &apos;s how most sales is done and that &apos;s how most of us communicate inter@@ personally .
and this is how we began .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
i was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive !
so , we pus@@ h@@ ed the pil@@ es down through the dun@@ e , and we create an ini@@ tial bac@@ teri@@ al surface .
they seem cle@@ ver@@ er .
so , dr. love b@@ ases his argument on studies showing that when you boo@@ st people &apos;s oxytocin , this increases their trust , empathy and co@@ operation .
but that &apos;s what the math says .
we ho@@ sted a competi@@ tion and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas .
he had to come in like a truck , a se@@ mi , with this thing . &quot;
so , i &apos;ll talk about it at a future ted .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
science is not argu@@ ing about that .
you could fight for your country , you could die for your country , you could ser@@ ve in your country &apos;s civil service , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now .
there are people creating jobs .
i mean , big piece at the molecular level .
we then put in the d@@ bs electro@@ des and we wait for a month or a year , and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase gl@@ u@@ co@@ se u@@ ti@@ li@@ zation .
shu@@ t him up . &quot;
as you can see , &quot; we feel fine &quot; colle@@ cts very , very small@@ -@@ scale personal stories .
in china , in russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber@@ -@@ offen@@ sive cap@@ abilities , this is exactly what they are doing .
she not only changed her own dynami@@ c , she changed her hou@@ seh@@ old , she changed her family , her village .
all of the staff were ex@@ -@@ police -- interesting -- and ex@@ -@@ prob@@ ation offi@@ cers .
first , a video .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
and so in my life@@ time , a lot of what &apos;s happened in the world -- and being a person obsessed with food -- a lot of this has really changed .
that &apos;s my feeling .
and so it &apos;s a very , very important thing for them , and for their audi@@ ences .
and there &apos;s actually an instru@@ ction on the pun@@ ch card which says &quot; ring the bell . &quot; so you can imagine this &quot; ting ! &quot;
and everywhere there were these terrible problems .
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .
my first sa@@ tis@@ fying sculp@@ ture was made in collabor@@ ation with these fi@@ sher@@ men .
so in my work , i hear that life is hard , relationships are filled with risk .
have you seen the new work they &apos;ve done to the wal@@ tz to@@ wers ?
and so my work , really , is trying to understand the character of that mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation compar@@ ed to the cen@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation to see what mysteri@@ es we can understand from dinosau@@ rs and from other animals about what life on dri@@ fting continents really can tell us about evolution .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basi@@ cs first .
i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of bo@@ ff@@ ins sitting together in a room and issu@@ ing yet another ar@@ can@@ e stat@@ ement .
instead of going out and gu@@ ess@@ ing about our ance@@ stry , di@@ gging things up out of the ground , possible ancestors , and saying it on the basis of mor@@ ph@@ ology -- which we still don &apos;t completely understand , we don &apos;t know the genetic causes underlying this mor@@ ph@@ ological variation -- what we need to do is turn the problem on its head .
my name is sar@@ ah brown w@@ ess@@ ling .
let &apos;s now zo@@ om back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
but i found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon em@@ bo@@ died .
on either side of us are mountain ran@@ ges that are higher than the al@@ ps , so the setting here is very dramatic .
and we see it all over the place as well now .
100 million comp@@ act flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent light bul@@ bs means that we &apos;ll save 600 million dollars in energy bills , and 20 million tons of co2 every year , year in and year out .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the colle@@ ctors like .
he got his paper back expe@@ cting a ne@@ ar-@@ perfect score , and couldn &apos;t believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero .
is there something driving this ?
and what &apos;s amazing , when you use this technology , for example , looking at humans , we &apos;re not just covered in a sea of microbes .
and so what i &apos;m showing you over here , these are actual exerci@@ ses that i started writing for my cou@@ sins .
so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you , kind of , the steps we go through .
and it &apos;s not just because of regu@@ lation ; it &apos;s because of the amount of money needed under the current evi@@ den@@ ce-@@ based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
now , when i was first doing this , all i was trying to do was count the numbers of sources .
so , we &apos;ve got now this fl@@ our .
those two things are the huge shi@@ f@@ ts of power in our century .
and the archite@@ ct is really , he mo@@ ves into the position of being an orchestr@@ ator of all of these process@@ es .
we now have a culture of di@@ stra@@ ction .
i ask you , what happened to trans@@ lation ?
a brand@@ -@@ new way to put buildings together , something called mass cu@@ st@@ omi@@ zation . no , it is not an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
ja@@ y wal@@ ker , cur@@ ator of the libr@@ ary of human imagination , condu@@ cts a surprising sho@@ w-@@ and@@ -@@ tell session high@@ ligh@@ ting a few of the intri@@ gu@@ ing arti@@ facts that back@@ dropped the 2008 stage .
now , there &apos;s a history of this in science and before i tell you what it is , i &apos;m going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science .
but we need to know how to do it .
in fact , i think in the next decade , without any question , we will discover life on mars and find that it is literally u@@ bi@@ qui@@ t@@ ous under the so@@ ils and different parts of that planet .
and over the course of the last six years in north@@ west pakistan , the cia has flo@@ wn hundreds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those dr@@ ones to kill 2@@ ,000 su@@ spe@@ cted paki@@ stan@@ i and taliban mili@@ tants .
i didn &apos;t have science in school . i have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . i can &apos;t help you . &quot;
you know , and@@ y gro@@ ve ste@@ pped down as cha@@ ir@@ man of the board at in@@ tel -- and and@@ y was one of my ment@@ ors , tough individual .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a manifest@@ ation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identi@@ ty but that nobody can have .
resol@@ ution is something that is far more limited .
in other words , who contro@@ ls the world ?
but this is different .
and i want to ask three questions in this talk , in the 10 minutes that re@@ main , about the blo@@ go@@ sphere .
we &apos;re in@@ und@@ ated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappe@@ aring and it &apos;s at its lo@@ west level .
and if we look at the rain@@ fall pattern above sam@@ bo@@ ja le@@ star@@ i , it used to be the dri@@ est place , but now you see consi@@ st@@ ently see a peak of rain forming there .
for example : a person who is cul@@ tiv@@ ating compassion , when they are in the pres@@ ence of suffering , they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do .
and this goes into my last point .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into lo@@ ving families early on , they re@@ cover their develop@@ mental del@@ a@@ ys , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
and here comes biology -- biology , with its basic question , which still stands un@@ answered , which is essentially : &quot; if there is life on other planets , do we expect it to be like life on earth ? &quot;
i want to address the issue of sa@@ vings .
so let me show you some examples of what these minim@@ um s@@ na@@ p tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ories look like .
in the 198@@ 0s , it was very fashi@@ on@@ able to talk about getting prices right .
now we also study more complex expres@@ sions . this is con@@ sol@@ ation .
and therefore , it &apos;s through listening that we &apos;ve come to un@@ cover some of the universe &apos;s most important secre@@ ts -- its scale , what it &apos;s made of and even how old it is .
these funny sig@@ ns that fl@@ ash your speed at you , some of the new ones , on the bottom right , now actually show a smi@@ ley face or a fro@@ w@@ ny face , to act as an emotional tri@@ gger .
well not thousands -- hundreds of people , lots of people -- all the press , because we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day , a peace day .
but they can show you how to build things in sequ@@ ence .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the cr@@ ank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
he was a great story@@ teller .
and this is a litt@@ le-@@ known technological fact about the internet , but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusi@@ as@@ m .
are we ready to do that ? yes ?
there &apos;s something else about these people , these americans who are there .
and the bible says that david la@@ id up great stores of ir@@ on , and which ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ologists have found , that in present@@ -@@ day pal@@ est@@ ine , there are evi@@ den@@ ces of that generation .
one day , i was fac@@ ed fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with chri@@ st .
the picture on india is the d@@ har@@ a@@ v@@ i slum of mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i in india .
but focus now is back on pre@@ vention .
intui@@ tive is just another word for familiar .
i know you &apos;re out there , they told me back@@ stage , it &apos;s a full house and such .
and he dro@@ ve me out to the university of pi@@ ttsburgh where i filled out a college appli@@ cation and got in on prob@@ ation .
and it was just ligh@@ t@@ ning fast ; the way she was working was almost unbelie@@ vable .
this was his hor@@ ser@@ a@@ dish . he was obsessed with it !
and the women are di@@ ligen@@ t . they are focused ; they work hard .
the classi@@ c quote is , i think , it &apos;s un@@ predict@@ able at best , is what people think right now , is the out@@ come .
it must have occurred to ca@@ str@@ o that he has the chance to do for cu@@ ba what den@@ g xi@@ a@@ oping did for china , but he doesn &apos;t have a h@@ ong kon@@ g there on the island in cu@@ ba .
it makes you ti@@ red and ir@@ ri@@ table to have to make up all of that data .
explor@@ ation is the engine that dri@@ ves innovation .
now talking about e@@ .t. putting us there , or some other life , just pus@@ h@@ es the problem further on .
and his answer was very interesting .
so you are , in fact , a ch@@ ord -- each of you an individual ch@@ ord .
it &apos;s pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous on its face .
the electri@@ c company in this nation oper@@ ates under a rule , which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low , sub@@ si@@ di@@ zed price -- in fact , a price that is so low it lo@@ ses money on every unit that it s@@ ells .
this institution is govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked and it has been the case for the past three decades .
and then it &apos;s never good enough .
a con@@ gol@@ ese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her ra@@ ped in front of them and mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in front of them , and her children saw their nin@@ e-@@ year-old si@@ bling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now .
we won &apos;t have succe@@ e@@ ded unless we take that next big step .
in addition to making this personal -- so we &apos;re going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women &apos;s relationship with their heart -- we &apos;re going to wa@@ x into the politics .
my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience .
we must go to watch &quot; afgh@@ an star . &quot;
we &apos;re now , instead of shi@@ pping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet .
there is a picture of charles . so let &apos;s watch the next cli@@ p .
so , what it says to me then is that it &apos;s not really -- the problem isn &apos;t really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told , the problem really is the terms of humanity that we &apos;re willing to bring to compli@@ cate every story , and that &apos;s really what it &apos;s all about .
but a lot of times in hollywood , when casting dire@@ ctors find out you &apos;re of middle eastern des@@ cent , they go , &quot; oh , you &apos;re ir@@ ani@@ an . great .
so there were no longer sho@@ e makers , but now there are people sla@@ pping sol@@ es on people &apos;s shoes .
so why do we learn mathematics ?
it &apos;s a terrible website . it &apos;s got really awful graphi@@ cs .
these are hundreds of classes .
three questions , for me , are key .
the conne@@ ctivity situation has improved great@@ ly , but some bar@@ ri@@ ers re@@ main .
and ruf@@ us is going to be doing some improvi@@ sation on his cu@@ sto@@ m , fi@@ ve-@@ str@@ ing electri@@ c c@@ ello , and it &apos;s very exciting to listen to him .
how did this great story un@@ fold , the making of nan@@ o ?
gol@@ die ha@@ wn : thank you . choose five ?
you should say , &quot; that &apos;s odd . i thought i read that this demo@@ graphic , young men and women in their 20@@ s and 3@@ 0s , is largely il@@ liter@@ ate in afghanistan . &quot;
thanks .
so this is what i learned .
we put the m@@ ops in the hall@@ way and re-@@ engine@@ ered the thing and that &apos;s where we recorded the first gram@@ my .
the reason why i don &apos;t believe that tells us that the ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als had language is -- here &apos;s a simple analo@@ gy : fer@@ r@@ ar@@ is are cars that have eng@@ ines .
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gon@@ na find out what it was , and she was gon@@ na fix it .
i sei@@ ze comm@@ and by physical pro@@ w@@ ess , and i keep it by be@@ ating my ch@@ est , and you make sub@@ mis@@ sive gest@@ ures .
we don &apos;t always meet those standards , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re stri@@ ving for .
now this is a video of ka@@ mal .
so ori@@ gin@@ ally i didn &apos;t have much money , so i went to a hardware store and i bought a car@@ p@@ enter &apos;s vi@@ ce .
the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separ@@ ated for a good 12 years .
i &apos;m a contract computer scientist by trade , but i &apos;m the fo@@ under of something called the tin@@ k@@ ering school .
and many of my friends were bal@@ let dan@@ cers .
he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de -- the same stuff that survived these past mass extin@@ ctions -- and he turns a mam@@ mal into a re@@ pti@@ le .
most are ne@@ oc@@ las@@ si@@ cal , heavy and op@@ a@@ que , made of stone or con@@ cre@@ te .
and we heard that rob was ok , but dou@@ g was too weak to come down .
then , a little bit later , i start getting some pictures like this .
and they do what we &apos;ve always done when con@@ fron@@ ted with huge amo@@ un@@ ts of data that we don &apos;t understand -- which is that they give them a name and a story .
and these little d@@ ots , these represent a sort of sound that &apos;s not a vo@@ cal , not a ly@@ ri@@ cal way of expres@@ sing the voice .
they &apos;re the next turn of this particular scre@@ w , which has been going on 20 years now .
neu@@ ral activity is constantly changing .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it &apos;s getting hea@@ vier because we &apos;re understanding that we need to do more than we are .
and that is now what we &apos;re trying to do , and working with this large cities group to fight climate change , to ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate huge , big , volume de@@ als that will en@@ able cities which generate 75 percent of the world &apos;s green@@ house g@@ ases , to dra@@ stically and quickly reduce green@@ house gas emissions in a way that is good economi@@ cs .
we need to combine all this stuff .
this pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
and it will inno@@ v@@ ate in ways that we cannot anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
you will give your genome to the pharma@@ cist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won &apos;t have side effects .
but now i wanted to work in a very low-@@ tech way , so something that would mean at the same time a lu@@ mp of c@@ ot@@ ton , a cloud and dur@@ er &apos;s praying hands -- although this looks a lot more like mi@@ ck@@ ey mouse &apos;s praying hands .
and so therefore , because time is short , if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . it &apos;s very strai@@ ght@@ forward .
and that is the result , directly , of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production .
they want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it &apos;ll spread .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about budgets , military budgets , and how the de@@ b@@ ts of countries work out .
it &apos;s this dark purple preci@@ pi@@ tate within the cell that &apos;s telling us a gene is turned on there .
well , if that had been the case , there would have been no industrial revolution .
then they pro@@ mote the up@@ take of nutri@@ ents .
effectively , this is the brain@@ was@@ hing process that has be@@ gun .
that &apos;s holding your bre@@ ath as long as you can in one place without moving .
all right , we &apos;ll try to do a few la@@ ps around and bring it back in .
a heli@@ cop@@ ter came in at 2@@ 1,000 feet and car@@ ried out the highest heli@@ cop@@ ter res@@ cu@@ e in history .
the moment i stopp@@ ed , half a do@@ zen other people immediately rin@@ ged the same guy .
so , ok .
if we want to think of new kinds of arguments , what we need to do is think of new kinds of argu@@ ers .
so in these countries , more economic transa@@ ctions occur and more wealth is created , alle@@ vi@@ ating poverty .
at 7 p@@ .@@ m@@ . on a sun@@ day in hidden spr@@ ings , i@@ da@@ ho , where the six members of the star@@ r family are sitting down to the high@@ light of their week : the family meeting .
the best answer lies in trying to re@@ constru@@ ct a dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an evolutionary history of our arti@@ stic and a@@ esthe@@ tic ta@@ stes .
a@@ o : or another one ? how about in g min@@ or ?
in fact , you can see each lo@@ go is a little bit different .
21@@ st-@@ century science is going to be dri@@ ven by the integration of these two ideas : the trium@@ ph of rela@@ tional ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self-@@ organization or dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand .
it goes out to a really long distance , compar@@ ed to any of these other sorts of things .
and i worked with me@@ h@@ ta vi@@ ha@@ r who creates virtual simu@@ lations for the army for t@@ ac@@ tical practice .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every holi@@ day to gand@@ o .
they may represent social , religious , political , economic , military reali@@ ties .
it took me three years to publi@@ sh that .
&quot; we hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equal . &quot;
and they gave me lo@@ d@@ ging with a single mother and her daughter .
but how do they pick up those cele@@ sti@@ al cu@@ es ?
the united kingdom is con@@ sum@@ ing 1.@@ 25 watts per square meter .
they &apos;re dead ends . they are ro@@ und@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts or traffic j@@ ams or gri@@ d@@ lock in conversation .
and another restaurant .
or about the millions of other nigeri@@ ans who start businesses and sometimes fa@@ il , but continue to nurse ambi@@ tion ?
these cha@@ ins then progress and atta@@ ch to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells .
why make this thing ?
what you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visuali@@ zation of that body .
of course , it &apos;s human rights .
or you can ra@@ mp up and go up to 50 stars on a fla@@ g , with 13 stri@@ pes .
this is actually being per@@ formed by brian mc@@ wh@@ or@@ ter , who is an extraordinary perfor@@ mer .
and it surpri@@ ses me that no model currently exists that qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ es the effect of environmental fac@@ tors on human lung health , because that relationship seems so important .
they actually have these bu@@ ses that drive up and over the lat@@ er@@ al mor@@ a@@ ine and drop people off on the surface of the gl@@ aci@@ er .
but this was progress -- you know , give them credit . and now today , we &apos;ve seen more progress . i think -- i hope -- most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings , deser@@ ve to be treated de@@ cently , unless they do something hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of race or religion .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
let me just give you an example .
so sustain@@ ability is quite important for us , which should in@@ corpo@@ rate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
now they &apos;ve been asking a question since 198@@ 5 : &quot; how stron@@ gly do you pre@@ fer a fir@@ st-@@ born son ? &quot;
we currently have 4@@ 3 courses on the platform from four universi@@ ties across a range of di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ines , and let me show you a little bit of an over@@ view of what that looks like .
me .
and then , of course , design is never done .
that condi@@ tion &apos;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want , which is , you know , 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities .
and there is one reaction that &apos;s probably the easi@@ est fu@@ sion reaction to do .
how do you do this ? how do you solve this problem ?
the carbon story here is a really good one .
there &apos;s a di@@ sin@@ cen@@ tive to conser@@ ve , because , if you don &apos;t use your water right , you can lose your water right .
i &apos;m just doing what i can here .
so , paul sa@@ ff@@ o , before his talk said that he didn &apos;t really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk , and that anxi@@ ety was really hel@@ p@@ ful in caus@@ ing him to focus .
thank you .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
now , what was in moses &apos; hand ?
and working with ngos and building this case .
here we have the extreme with dead cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al sou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
freu@@ d probably could explain cho@@ col@@ ate better than i@@ . he was the first subject .
what i &apos;m trying to tell re@@ a@@ ders is that plastic doesn &apos;t really go away ; it just continu@@ es to was@@ h down@@ stream .
this is a cru@@ cially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nami@@ cs -- the law that says that entro@@ py increases in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe .
he is viewed by many as the fo@@ under of the prob@@ ability theory , and a cre@@ ator of the first model of a computer .
is there more than one universe ? in this visu@@ ally rich , ac@@ tion-@@ pac@@ ked talk , brian gre@@ ene shows how the un@@ answered questions of physics have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the &quot; multi@@ ver@@ se . &quot;
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
we know , and i know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
i know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but i don &apos;t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another .
throughout it all , the dollar has been one of the most long-@@ standing , stable , reas@@ on@@ able cur@@ ren@@ cies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people scre@@ aming about tell us , no matter how sc@@ ared we &apos;re supposed to be .
65 million comp@@ act flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent light bul@@ bs were sold last year .
story is fluid and it belon@@ gs to nobody .
we depend on the fact that audi@@ ences , such as your@@ selves , will make as@@ sump@@ tions .
now , you &apos;ve been kind and ... i &apos;m going to sing this to bill g@@ ates .
the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier , long before the symptoms emer@@ ge .
that really , the mix@@ ing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and en@@ jo@@ yed a career doing that .
i &apos;m going to finish up with a song of mine called &quot; weather systems . &quot;
poe@@ try is what el@@ ev@@ ates the ban@@ al and ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted object to a real@@ m of art .
d@@ j : there &apos;s a bur@@ ge@@ oning b@@ one trade .
it &apos;s called sp@@ y@@ fish , and it &apos;s a company called h@@ 2@@ eye , started by ni@@ gel ja@@ gger in london .
this machine is really strange , and one of the consequences is that people are weird .
and what this data lea@@ ves in its wake is a landscape .
the sun end was about four in@@ ches in diam@@ e@@ ter , and then it ta@@ per@@ ed over about 35 feet to about a milli@@ meter at the earth end .
now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
the point , most of us . what &apos;s the point ?
and if you he@@ fted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .
that &apos;s because the two countries have about the same population size .
so this is the ti@@ mel@@ ine , and if you &apos;ve ever edi@@ ted video , you &apos;re familiar with this , but instead of cli@@ ps in the ti@@ mel@@ ine , what you &apos;re looking at is web events pulled into the video .
they don &apos;t pres@@ er@@ ve well , as you know .
because only once before has the fa@@ te of individual people and the fa@@ te of all of humanity been so inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed .
why ? because , as ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y tells us , we have no direct access to our physical world , other than through our senses .
the magi@@ cal moment , the magi@@ cal moment of condu@@ cting .
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .
and this is a day in the life of a mol@@ a , and if we -- they &apos;re up and down , and up and down , and up and down , and up and up and down , up to 40 times a day .
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -- lights that can allow us to see what we currently don &apos;t see .
and a lot of people ask me , you know , what kind of people do you get for a project like this ?
thank you very much .
i &apos;m just a designer . so i need them .
i was a professor at the u.@@ c. da@@ v@@ is system , and i got a lot of exci@@ tement around this , and i was able to fund the initi@@ ation of the program back in that time .
one interesting problem is the stone isn &apos;t very hard .
thank you .
but male role models for boys that say it &apos;s all right to be smart -- they &apos;ve got da@@ ds , they &apos;ve got pa@@ stors , they &apos;ve got cu@@ b sc@@ out leaders , but ultimately , six hours a day , five days a week they &apos;re spending in a classroom , and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .
and we &apos;ve just recently demon@@ strated this by putting extra@@ ct of hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons on little glass be@@ ads , and dropping the be@@ ads g@@ ently down into the nest ent@@ ran@@ ce at the right rate .
she was a cr@@ yst@@ allo@@ graph@@ er .
give me predict@@ ability , give me surprise .
by foc@@ using so much on ourselves and our g@@ ad@@ gets , we have ren@@ der@@ ed the individuals on the other end into invi@@ sibility , as tiny and inter@@ chan@@ ge@@ able as the parts of a mobile phone .
but , you know , the government would make a plane ; they &apos;d say , go see if that one flies , would you ?
we said that if you stop to swa@@ p your battery more than 50 times a year we start pa@@ ying you money because it &apos;s an in@@ conveni@@ ence .
and people told me -- like these 3@@ 6 views of the empire state building -- they told me , &quot; you &apos;re making artist books . &quot;
they are using us to su@@ ck up the planet &apos;s resources to produce more computers , and more of all these amazing things we &apos;re hearing about here at ted .
let me tell you what we think about children .
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2@@ d shape -- the b -- as@@ semble from a str@@ ing of components that follow extremely simple rules .
maybe that &apos;s because you don &apos;t actually have ac@@ ne .
you try out all 10 ; you keep the one that works best .
here &apos;s the problem : any serious can@@ di@@ date for our universe is ine@@ vit@@ ably full of compu@@ ta@@ tional ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ bi@@ lity .
it took my friends 20 years .
my exci@@ tement is : i get a chance to give something back .
and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you .
river cra@@ b is h@@ é@@ xi@@ è , is the ph@@ on@@ o@@ gram for harmon@@ i@@ zation , for cen@@ sor@@ ship .
and many people in this audience probably wouldn &apos;t be alive if doctors didn &apos;t do this .
he just han@@ gs out . he &apos;s rela@@ x@@ ed .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
but on a@@ pri@@ l 21 , a wonder@@ fully hon@@ est moment occurred .
action .
we &apos;ve got a lot of a good team of people working up there .
it &apos;s like put out in the two oceans and it &apos;s pulling the whole country apart , pulling left and right into their own terri@@ t@@ ories like the b@@ loo@@ ds and the cri@@ ps .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little c@@ ough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just min@@ ers , but everybody .
so when we started finding these results , as you might imagine , it created quite a bit of sti@@ r in the scientific and the popular press .
and i thought this was so much better than making trucks .
and i hope what you are able to see is actually a fl@@ ash of light .
i won &apos;t feel anything , but if i could , i would feel trium@@ p@@ ha@@ l at having lived at all , and at having lived on this sp@@ len@@ did planet , and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here in the first place , before not being here .
or take the in@@ famous ver@@ se about killing the unbelie@@ vers .
this is by a du@@ o , michael aber@@ na@@ thy and bu@@ d holl@@ and .
they all accep@@ ted to be pa@@ sted next to the other .
so there &apos;s my first message , that if you are to pass through these turbul@@ ent times more or less turbul@@ ently , then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sen@@ sible govern@@ ance to the global space .
some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food cha@@ in who sort of di@@ c@@ tate to us what we &apos;re all going to wear , but if you talk to any designer at any level , including these high-@@ end designers , they always say their main inspiration comes from the street : where people like you and me re@@ mix and match our own fashion looks .
as a physician , i have to try and define what &apos;s going on , and to reas@@ sure people , especially to reas@@ sure them that they &apos;re not going in@@ san@@ e .
if you &apos;re on val@@ en@@ cia street within those few blocks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ pac@@ ks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
i hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , i got my back@@ p@@ ack and i went on to the university of wis@@ consi@@ n .
every six months until they &apos;re six years old -- we &apos;re going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the g@@ y@@ r@@ i and the sul@@ c@@ i of the brains fold to see how this ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent development actually turns into memor@@ ies and the mar@@ vel that is us .
do something different . what do you want to be ? &quot;
yeah ?
and it doesn &apos;t mean that we think things will magi@@ cally turn out okay , but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so .
and it &apos;s very common that we comp@@ are india with china .
and the answer is no , he &apos;s just a boy .
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes , i might score an f .
that someday is already here if you &apos;re a mouse .
this is my office . it &apos;s out there .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard this an@@ ec@@ do@@ te , but i have .
and the big day comes .
imagine that s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y is a di@@ stin@@ ctively u.k. phenomenon fix@@ ated on country hou@@ ses and ti@@ tles .
stephen han@@ son from swe@@ den .
for three months out of the year , they go to 50 below zero .
if we did , we could see that our own resources are easi@@ er to use than anybody can imagine .
but there is zero cor@@ relation between i@@ q and emotional empathy , feeling with the other person .
the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle hab@@ its that they follow ritu@@ ali@@ stically for most of their lives .
it &apos;s really very simple , but really very complicated .
the way to do this is to do it on a company basis , to take leadership forward , and to do it for as many important se@@ ctors which have a cost , and to disc@@ lose these answers .
some can be arm@@ ed with h@@ d cameras and do counter@@ sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lance on prote@@ sters , or , as in this little bit of movie magic , quad@@ cop@@ ters can be loaded with fi@@ re@@ arms and autom@@ atic weapons .
re@@ u@@ ters now integr@@ ates african blogs into their co@@ verage of africa .
so it is going to get bigger .
the picture i &apos;m about to show you however , for those of you that are even the sli@@ gh@@ test bit squ@@ ea@@ mi@@ sh -- even though you may not like to ad@@ mit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down . this is a good time to look at your feet , check your bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the screen .
we &apos;re obsessed with mor@@ ality as social creatures .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
and women have dra@@ wn the short medical stra@@ w because it now turns out that many of these drugs don &apos;t work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they &apos;re activ@@ ely har@@ m@@ ful for women to take .
and the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt , but it stabi@@ li@@ zed .
that was a turning point for my life .
and most of all , a kind of norm@@ alized political fear inv@@ aded our lives .
and it can be done .
thank you .
she &apos;s just a few in@@ ches off the top of my head .
the average li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood is about 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; ye@@ p . still think it &apos;s about 11 percent . &quot;
&quot; where did you do it ? &quot; &quot; in his car . &quot;

that &apos;s about 2,@@ 7@@ 00 fres@@ h , conne@@ ctive links across about 1@@ 12 million blogs that are out there .
i have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ a@@ do@@ s that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seri@@ ousness of life .
and just put radi@@ ally they &apos;re going out that way .
so the ro@@ sl@@ ings have been able to do simpli@@ city without re@@ moving what &apos;s important about the data .
so now we have this blue gene super@@ computer .
so , from that my@@ th@@ ology , the upper city and lower city come .
this isn &apos;t an ex@@ act science , but it gets pretty accu@@ rate .
i guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
and as norden fam@@ ously says , &quot; before that bom@@ b@@ sight came along , bom@@ bs would rou@@ tin@@ ely miss their target by a mile or more . &quot;

now , i haven &apos;t met these particular students , but i &apos;ve met students like them .
sometimes you think things are impossible .
and we need to de@@ code that into simple sequ@@ ences -- basically the dna of how our buildings work .

this digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with twitter stre@@ ams that are already tren@@ ding and news from other time z@@ ones .
we think that we can actually create a crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced filter .
so i would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
now , put yourself in their shoes .
i thought to myself , &quot; what now ? where do i turn ? &quot;
and a little bit higher , why they have a gla@@ ze on a thing they call a thal@@ i .
i mean , i &apos;m an american . i believe in free markets .
&quot; flo@@ ating islands . &quot;
bon@@ o : all right . i wish for ted to truly show the power of information , its power to re@@ write the rules and transform lives , by conne@@ cting every hospital , health clin@@ ic and school in one african country .
because the world is big .
and you &apos;re really ri@@ dding your body of co2 .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the head@@ lines of the new@@ spa@@ pers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
if we look at that region in mamm@@ als that don &apos;t see so well , such as bats , and we find that bats that don &apos;t see so well have the purple type , we know that this is probably what &apos;s caus@@ ing this disease .
and third chance for swe@@ den , against brazi@@ l here .
it &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
you &apos;re a tr@@ es@@ pas@@ ser with about as much sense as these people were tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ers .
but it didn &apos;t start out that way .
went through design , some architecture .
the archite@@ ct lost here .
or perhaps i should say , more ac@@ cur@@ ately , se@@ ñ@@ or pr@@ ing@@ le .
i don &apos;t have time to get into all this , but if you want to understand how a brain works , you have to understand how the first part of the mamm@@ ali@@ an neocortex works , how it is we store patterns and make predi@@ ctions .
and i can look at the journey , not just the dest@@ ination .
and then on the right is what i re@@ fer to as a foot@@ note pan@@ el .
now , you could do that with mi@@ rr@@ ors from one angle .
&quot; did you see him on 60 minutes , ra@@ cing michael ph@@ el@@ ps in a po@@ ol -- nothing but swim tr@@ un@@ ks on -- di@@ ving in the water , determined to beat this swimming champi@@ on ?
that is not a fore@@ cast about how com@@ modi@@ ty prices go ; it &apos;s a fore@@ cast of the consequences , the long-@@ term consequences , for growth of an increase in prices .
yeah , it &apos;s one of those giant camera len@@ ses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it &apos;s sort of a little movie , without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .
this process is a very calcul@@ ated process .
or will some of the me@@ tal@@ lic objects laun@@ ched from the earth spa@@ wn new o@@ ases , a post-@@ human life el@@ se@@ where ?

and so we need a post-@@ conflict comp@@ act .
that &apos;s what europe is doing , so we could have di@@ lu@@ ted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what michael spec@@ ter said , the anti-@@ vac@@ cine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .

they &apos;re writing in big hand@@ writing to take more gold . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re going to find you . &quot;
you have wee@@ k@@ ly re@@ views . you &apos;re constantly changing .
the most fri@@ ction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock .
and i was taken to the secret ice cre@@ am@@ -@@ eating place in a little town , where we went to a back room , and women were se@@ ated and a cur@@ tain was pulled around us , and they were served van@@ ill@@ a ice cre@@ am .
i took this picture just two days ago .
they &apos;ll be absolutely fine with the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian and with the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ er , but you can &apos;t ri@@ de him .
and so that year , i started to build this robot , k@@ is@@ met , the world &apos;s first social robot .
and as jobs continue to leave my community , and energy continu@@ es to come in , be expor@@ ted in , it &apos;s no wonder that really some people re@@ fer to the south bronx as a desert .
and i &apos;m col@@ oring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequ@@ ence in its genome to that virus .
and this is not only an issue of social justice , as ann co@@ op@@ er said -- and , of course , she &apos;s completely right -- but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
that is an 80 cent gall@@ on .
but the mon@@ gol@@ s get there first .
there &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indi@@ cate that we were coming back .
the things are connected in the brain .
now , what i &apos;ve talked about are physi@@ ologi@@ c metri@@ cs .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael poll@@ an in which he argu@@ ed that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
i didn &apos;t like nuclear bom@@ b-@@ prop@@ elled spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps .
well i was born in the most difficult time , when my country was at war .
one day , i was changing the shape of a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o piece and ended up setting the place on fire .
so we say the universe is exp@@ and@@ ing .
now i don &apos;t know if any of you out there invented chi@@ cken nu@@ g@@ gets , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re rich if you did .
this is a par@@ ach@@ u@@ ti@@ st with another par@@ ach@@ u@@ ti@@ st doing exactly the same thing .
it was not something you &apos;d even re@@ mark upon .
the state &apos;s not alone . there are many , many ac@@ tors .
i wanted to try it in the most extreme situ@@ ations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under dur@@ ess .
and i went up to apo@@ logi@@ ze to him , and he said , &quot; stan@@ ley , i thought you did great . &quot;
i don &apos;t know how you keep it up , chris , i really don &apos;t .
you can go back to his wri@@ t@@ ings : it &apos;s quite extraordinary .
no one &apos;s found them . we know where they are , and we &apos;re going to go and get them next year .
it &apos;s made of clay , and it &apos;s been fashi@@ oned into a cy@@ lin@@ der shape , covered with close writing and then ba@@ ked dr@@ y in the sun .
instead , so far , the meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments coming from the l@@ h@@ c show no sig@@ ns of new particles or un@@ expected phenomen@@ a .
and now who would you rather be if a ju@@ i@@ cy piece of go@@ ssi@@ p -- not about you -- was spre@@ ading through the network ?
the woman paid him no he@@ ed .
learning this , i knew there had to be a better way .
so this small missing ch@@ unk here is puzz@@ ling .
and when li@@ on@@ el started his ba@@ ker@@ y the french po@@ o@@ h@@ -@@ po@@ o@@ h@@ -@@ ed it .
so there &apos;s two bills in congress right now .
that means that the brains are syn@@ ced up more closely in terms of simul@@ tane@@ ous activity , and the arro@@ ws flow clearly from left to right .
when the teachers would ask questions , she &apos;d be the first person to raise her hand .
it &apos;s actually bi@@ t@@ co@@ in .
de@@ v@@ du@@ tt pat@@ tan@@ ai@@ k : east v@@ s. west -- the my@@ ths that my@@ sti@@ fy
the state of the art at the time was something called mark@@ er-@@ based motion cap@@ ture .
tv is full of people who do what we wi@@ shed to do , but never got to .
if the people i &apos;m going to tell you the story about , if they hadn &apos;t done it , somebody else would have .
just the basic feeling .
it does , and it can , work in bul@@ gari@@ a .
and expression also , it has brought tal@@ ents .
and in the end , you know , they adap@@ ted this as a national i@@ con that came to represent swi@@ ss dou@@ bt , which we -- you know , it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of la@@ id on their own mean@@ ings off of .
i had a friend who worked at a pi@@ ck@@ le factory , and the cu@@ cum@@ bers would come flying down this con@@ ve@@ yer b@@ elt , and his job was to pick off the ones that didn &apos;t look so good and throw them in the bin lab@@ el@@ ed &quot; reli@@ sh &quot; where they &apos;d be cru@@ shed and mix@@ ed with v@@ ine@@ gar and used for other kinds of profit .
well , then we get to this image .
she said , &quot; well , you &apos;re giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions .
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bo@@ s@@ nia and the fail@@ ure in r@@ wand@@ a , when ser@@ bia attac@@ ked kosovo , international action was taken much more deci@@ si@@ vely .
these are the sun@@ glasses that don &apos;t sc@@ are people , simple stuff .
clearly , it didn &apos;t come out of a tonight show mon@@ olo@@ gue .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named bar@@ ack obama .
but for many parts of africa , a col@@ lea@@ gue of mine once put it this way , &quot; the ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire on tu@@ es@@ day night was re@@ ached just in time for the geno@@ cide to start on we@@ d@@ n@@ es@@ day morning . &quot;
but i really began to love cars then .
compu@@ tation only exists relative to consciousness .
thank you very much .
i found out how many people had been put in ja@@ il , how many family members had been killed .
&#91; &quot; schools as we know them are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te &quot; &#93; so that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
well , you &apos;ve got mail .
second insight . so far , until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design for pro@@ mo@@ tional pur@@ pos@@ es , which was fine with me .
so let me begin by first of all giving a very , very brief history of time , if i may in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge .
my wife poin@@ ted out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because o@@ ther@@ wise the whole thing will ti@@ p over .
i have a short notice to give you . &quot;
how many bul@@ let points or head@@ lines does steve jobs use ?
these are the dead in jon@@ e@@ sto@@ wn .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough .
he &apos;s like , &quot; no , miss , i &apos;m not going .
i emp@@ ha@@ size lea@@ ther because it is so wid@@ ely used .
and it was because of a rule , which , to me , is a very good rule : never be the bri@@ gh@@ test person in a room , and we weren &apos;t .
now that expen@@ se can be huge , but if the town can mobili@@ ze x amount of volun@@ te@@ ers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s contribu@@ tion .
five minutes i &apos;ll spend just because it &apos;s interesting . just because it &apos;s fun .
you may not know this word , but it should be your biological first name and last name .
happy little story , isn &apos;t it ?
now all this f@@ uss about a single one of our tra@@ its tells us there &apos;s something worth expla@@ ining .
and the result of that is , we &apos;re going to generate 8@@ 3@@ ,000 new jobs , four billion dollars a year in an@@ nu@@ al income , and reduce the co2 emissions by 17@@ 4 million tons a year .
so you may be able to hear some mosqui@@ to@@ es flying around .
it &apos;s almost like they &apos;re practi@@ cing magic tricks .
now how could that be ?
and one day he couldn &apos;t add up a line of fig@@ ures .
those pla@@ ques are pla@@ ques we &apos;ve been inst@@ all@@ ing around north america .
he couldn &apos;t match it up to any bones on the planet , and he said , a@@ ha ! it &apos;s extin@@ ct .
it &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
lose your sight , though , and it &apos;s a whole other story .
gravity is one thing that we can &apos;t see and which we don &apos;t understand .
but actually going out to pro@@ pa@@ gate that view is associated with either neo@@ conser@@ va@@ tivi@@ sm or with is@@ lam@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m .
but let &apos;s take a look behind my eyes .
what you have , actually , is there is one child oper@@ ating the computer .
it looks har@@ m@@ less enough .
for these specific patients , we actually just su@@ ture these materials .
and you know , i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time .
girls are trained to please .
guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequen@@ cing .
zo@@ e : stop .
model@@ ing , they tried model@@ ing all the time . they were always model@@ ing things .
but we &apos;ve been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go .
what you &apos;re looking at is a signature of bac@@ teri@@ al communities in the out@@ door air , and how they v@@ ary over time .
i &apos;ve written about this idea before , and i know there are people in this room who have expen@@ ded significant eff@@ ort on it in the past .
it &apos;s a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical product .
okay , i &apos;m going to sort you out .
i was finally there , although i had nothing to do -- i was a foreign exper@@ t .
and then it &apos;s usually won by cities where they speak ger@@ man , like d@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf or vi@@ en@@ na , where they &apos;re burning , again , half as much fuel .
what intri@@ gues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of para@@ do@@ xes that are both fru@@ str@@ ating and fascinating .
then i under@@ went cognitive training .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
and one of the journali@@ sts said to her , what &apos;s up ?
then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
the parents were looking in the window .
so you don &apos;t need to go into the recent calls list , so if you &apos;re trying to get through to somebody , just hit the call button again .
it &apos;s the history of what we eat today .
listen , listen , listen . now -- what can we do with th@@ under ?
every present@@ ation needs this slide in it .
in my own laborat@@ ory , the way we &apos;re trying to create in@@ organic life is by using many different reaction for@@ mat@@ s .
now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practi@@ cally minded , two questions immediately ari@@ se from his obser@@ vation .
they do lots of in@@ consi@@ stent things .
in fact , more than 95 percent of these children have living parents , and societies tend to bl@@ ame these parents for ab@@ and@@ oning these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the pri@@ mary dri@@ vers behind institu@@ tion@@ ali@@ zation are poverty , dis@@ ability and ethni@@ city .
and the fact is , millions is a gross esti@@ mate because we don &apos;t really know how many kids die each year of this .
america was j@@ ol@@ ted by the anti-@@ vi@@ et@@ na@@ m movement , the civil rights movement .
when you explain change -- for example , economic growth ; economic growth is about change -- when you explain change , you use other things that have changed to explain change , rather than using the con@@ stant to explain change .
think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient economi@@ sts and mis@@ repres@@ ent@@ ative ide@@ olo@@ gues have cap@@ tured the process .
and that does not even include those that are traff@@ i@@ cked within country bor@@ ders , which is a sub@@ stan@@ tial por@@ tion .
there is more that we &apos;re doing to expl@@ ore this idea of colle@@ ctive intelligence , that i , as a citi@@ zen , if i share the information with whatever device that i have , could in@@ form you about what is going on , and that if you do the same , we can have a bigger picture of what &apos;s going on .
at 3@@ 1 , he was not able to rel@@ ate the kind of &#91; unclear &#93; research , which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people .
this model re@@ quir@@ es you to act like the king , like the person in the front of the room thro@@ wing things to the pe@@ ons in the back .
my view is that if you want to invol@@ ve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on , you have to look like the solution and not the problem .
they don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
it means famili@@ ari@@ zation with a new way of being , new way of per@@ cei@@ ving things , which is more in ade@@ qu@@ ation with reality , with inter@@ depen@@ dence , with the stream and continu@@ ous transformation , which our being and our consciousness is .
of course , there is still gl@@ y@@ cine and al@@ an@@ ine , but in fact , there are these heavy elements , these heavy am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds , that are being produced because these are valuable to the organ@@ ism .
people seem to do a limited amount of strategi@@ c thinking using theory of mind .
in the 197@@ 0s , the one percent accoun@@ ted for about 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
now , to do that , we need to be able to bring a camera and instru@@ ments in together through one small tube , like that tube you saw in the la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y video .
tim , thank you for a very important talk . thank you .
data : i find it incredibly educational .
oh , the w@@ rat@@ h of photo@@ shop .
can you tell what &apos;s happening in a conversation ?
and our new book &quot; rein@@ venting fire &quot; descri@@ bes how you can cap@@ ture it .
and i &apos;m hop@@ e@@ ful because it &apos;s not only phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ py that &apos;s re@@ organi@@ zing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social se@@ ctor , and of business , that are bu@@ sy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
what we &apos;ve done as sp@@ am@@ mers is tried to hy@@ p@@ noti@@ ze everyone into buying our idea , hy@@ p@@ noti@@ ze everyone into don@@ ating to our cause , hy@@ p@@ noti@@ ze everyone into vot@@ ing for our can@@ di@@ date .
and i &apos;m not that far .
and i remember the last time i came back from india -- in my long white flo@@ wing ro@@ bes and my big be@@ ard and my john len@@ n@@ on glasses -- and i said to my father , &quot; dad , i think i &apos;ve just about found spiritual en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;
so we said , &quot; let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
cat@@ ar@@ in@@ a mot@@ a : play with smart materials
the pri@@ mary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen , to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the oxygen that your body con@@ su@@ mes .
that &apos;s the end of that .
so what studio h might off@@ er her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most mean@@ ing@@ ful way .
i am tor@@ n by your love for me .
i love theater .
so creating cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st or it@@ un@@ es and the iphone develop@@ er network , there are all these networks -- facebook as well .
they can talk -- they &apos;re very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little un@@ com@@ fort@@ able for them .
lots of you here will use smar@@ t@@ phones to take photos and post them from the conference .
it &apos;s made up of 16 con@@ cent@@ ri@@ c sh@@ ells . each one has 9@@ 2 sp@@ heres .
it seems like when you give people easi@@ er ways to share information , more good things happen .
keep you enga@@ ged . look at what people do -- ad@@ just the world to match their expe@@ c@@ tation .
we can down@@ load new diagno@@ stics .
but i put forward here , the government is not going to get us there .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples of the last pictures i &apos;ve done in the last year .
hey , you can &apos;t make this up .
no , no , ah@@ h ...
every me@@ al you eat con@@ tains ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents from all across the world .
but what are you doing ?
there &apos;s no competi@@ tion at all .
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot;
so you can see in a system like this there was enormous sub@@ tle potential of repres@@ ent@@ ing human emotions .
so basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pi@@ tch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continu@@ ously going ...
imagine a weather station that can be atta@@ ched to this .
and if you look at the species level , you saw about fish .
so we &apos;re going 100 percent ren@@ e@@ w@@ able .
these people , many of who@@ m have lived in north oxford , have argu@@ ed -- they &apos;ve argu@@ ed that belie@@ ving in god is ak@@ in to belie@@ ving in fai@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dish game .
he knew that institu@@ tional thinking doesn &apos;t work in india . individual thinking does .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , enga@@ ged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pu@@ ber@@ ty , or whatever it is .
so i &apos;ll conclu@@ de to invi@@ te you all to dead du@@ ck day .
the hope is that this gets more stem cells out , which transl@@ ates to better out@@ comes .
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools , 2.@@ 6 million years ago .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
but if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don &apos;t we know about them ?
the u.s. accoun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of total news co@@ verage .
i also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about lu@@ ck , and fa@@ te , and co@@ inci@@ den@@ ces and acci@@ dents , god &apos;s will , and the synchr@@ ony of mysteri@@ ous forces -- i will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
we made 3@@ 0,000 .
that &apos;s shown down here .
and keep going , until the subject pres@@ ses the button , saying , &quot; i see the change . &quot;
and it was successful overall .
and they were s@@ wollen so much , i couldn &apos;t even close them .
another thing about pri@@ mes , there is no final biggest prime number .
these are not epi@@ phy@@ te roots : these are roots that emer@@ ge from the tr@@ unk and bran@@ ch of the ho@@ st trees themselves .
of course , they died along with the mother .
pro@@ sp@@ era : for this , be sure , tonight tho@@ u s@@ halt have cra@@ mp@@ s .
and the scientists who are contribu@@ ting to e@@ ol are ans@@ wer@@ ing a question , &quot; what can we learn from this organ@@ ism ? &quot;
there are a lot of differences between powerful and power@@ less people .
we &apos;re e@@ mul@@ ating all the major faci@@ al expres@@ sions , and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine .
y@@ r : it &apos;s about 300 km per hour before lo@@ oping .
and what we found after dri@@ ll@@ ing back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events .
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
i was the 17-@@ 18 year-old age categ@@ ory w@@ inner and then the grand prize w@@ inner .
i &apos;m thinking of wa@@ el gh@@ on@@ im , though .
thank you very much .
they &apos;re ty@@ ping their program into the browser , and you can see they didn &apos;t get it quite right , la@@ dy liber@@ ty is still se@@ asi@@ ck .
no , it &apos;s a hormone called oxytocin .
i don &apos;t know . as a simple example , we could run a test here .
they do it by changing their shape .
this is part of a much larger program called the cen@@ su@@ s of mar@@ ine life , where they &apos;re going to be ta@@ gging all over the world and the mol@@ a &apos;s going to enter into that .
there was a time when i considered wild so@@ und@@ sc@@ apes to be a wor@@ th@@ less arti@@ fact .
and perhaps most remark@@ ably , at the beginning of the 21@@ st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth exten@@ ded to almost all parts of the world .
and this is dead .
the first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman , &quot; a little break . &quot;
now the u@@ phi@@ ll bat@@ tle for ghana and for africa is not over , but i have pro@@ of that the other side of democracy exists , and that we must not take it for gran@@ ted .
and i was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grill@@ ed chi@@ cken , which doesn &apos;t seem very har@@ m@@ ful .
often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mun@@ dan@@ e as what it looks like to us when they &apos;re bat@@ ting around so in clo@@ sing , if i could go into the future , if i could go into 20@@ 33 , the first thing i would ask is whether david si@@ mon had done a sequ@@ el to &quot; the wire . &quot; i would want to know .
as a body archite@@ ct , i &apos;ve created this li@@ mit@@ less and bo@@ und@@ less platform for me to discover whatever i want .
the interesting thing about studying cogni@@ tion has been that we &apos;ve been limited , in a way .
i &apos;m going to send everyone here a free cop@@ y of this book .
money was no problem .
and the ration@@ ale for this behavior is ex@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly religious .
and four children have just died .
our new french ce@@ o believed in the power of positive p@@ r ...
or , when he &apos;s more rela@@ x@@ ed , the head comes down and the e@@ ars listen , either side .
patient : these are two things .
because they are also a part of us .
and i talked to his mom , and i ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called ki@@ dro@@ bot .
the will is there .
but my friend as@@ su@@ red me that he wasn &apos;t ca@@ tholic , nor were most of his students , but he took his classes there every spring .
how could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
and thus began my life@@ -@@ long passion for writing fi@@ ction .
and here &apos;s the thing as well .
in the book , i go over contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es such as this one , and a number of other hot butt@@ ons , hot z@@ ones , cher@@ no@@ by@@ ls , third ra@@ ils , and so on -- including the arts , cl@@ oning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , hom@@ o@@ sexu@@ ality , in@@ fan@@ ti@@ cide , ine@@ quality , mar@@ x@@ ism , mor@@ ality , na@@ zi@@ sm , par@@ ent@@ ing , politics , race , ra@@ pe , religion , resource de@@ ple@@ tion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
and the wo@@ o@@ den dis@@ k was really thought about as something that you &apos;d want to hold on to , and that would gli@@ de easily through your hands .
i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nas@@ h@@ ville .
and west@@ ern@@ ers , europe@@ ans or americans , who didn &apos;t know about this before fac@@ ed this practice within some of the musli@@ m communities who migr@@ ated from north africa .
well , obviously , there &apos;s something in here , and you can all have a guess as to what it is .
so one of my graduate students , john scan@@ n@@ ella , looked through our whole colle@@ ction and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and , of course it &apos;s open , in torosaurus -- so he found the transi@@ tional ones between triceratops and torosaurus , which was pretty cool .
it was built enti@@ r@@ ely by hand off b@@ am@@ bo@@ o sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , people carrying these bas@@ kets of con@@ cre@@ te on their heads , du@@ mp@@ ing them in the forms .
maybe we &apos;ll be able to build a conscious machine .
we call it pro@@ pa@@ ganda gar@@ den@@ ing .
and i love may@@ n@@ ard si@@ pes , but he &apos;s off in his own world , and , bl@@ ess his heart , he &apos;s so par@@ ano@@ id .
we know this t@@ une , right ? we know it ?
make cl@@ ari@@ ty , transpar@@ ency and simpli@@ city a national pri@@ ority .
we need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to gui@@ de policy .
one very young , one a little more mat@@ ure .
and she starts thinking about having a child , and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child , she starts thinking about making room for that child .
when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toilet that doesn &apos;t flus@@ h . &quot;
when athei@@ sts like stephen hawking and alb@@ ert einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it of course as a metaph@@ ori@@ cal shor@@ th@@ and for that deep , mysteri@@ ous part of physics which we don &apos;t yet understand .
gal@@ o@@ is was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his bro@@ ther .
nor@@ man rock@@ well han@@ gs in living rooms and ba@@ thro@@ oms , and this is not something to be considered high art . &quot;
so anyway , she comes here , 196@@ 7 , she &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant , and she comes from ethi@@ opia that was cele@@ br@@ ating its own ju@@ bi@@ lee at the time under the em@@ per@@ or ha@@ i@@ le sel@@ as@@ sie , and she lands months before the en@@ o@@ ch po@@ well speech , the &quot; ri@@ vers of blood &quot; speech .
it was arm@@ ed with this knowledge that ultimately i would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ at@@ tered self , each fra@@ gment repres@@ ented by a different voice , gradu@@ ally with@@ draw from all my medi@@ cation , and return to psychi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side .
but today what i &apos;d like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people &apos;s soul and emotion .
it &apos;s very , very important .
in fact , that was a piece by be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven , and so i was not func@@ tioning as a com@@ pos@@ er .
we also re@@ fer to sub@@ clinical conditions .
no one was lost there . but the water continued to climb .
some games are more about war@@ f@@ are .
they tend to bi@@ te each other , often quite fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ously and usually on the face .
so we now have the largest peer-@@ gra@@ ding pipeline ever devi@@ sed , where tens of thousands of students are gra@@ ding each other &apos;s work , and quite success@@ fully , i have to say .
but we were able to do it , we got all the ki@@ ts made , thanks a lot to tech@@ shop , which was a big help to us , and we shi@@ pped these ki@@ ts all over the world just before christmas of last year , so it was just a few months ago .
she &apos;s watching .
and the idea is basically , can it look at you and make you feel as if like , &quot; what ? is it my shoes ? &quot;
when we look at works like this , we tend to associ@@ ate them with children &apos;s literature .
and as a ch@@ em@@ ist , we &apos;re not used to profound questions every day .
roman@@ tic love is an ob@@ session . it pos@@ s@@ esses you .
a few years ago , g@@ ate@@ way came out with fl@@ at screen t@@ v@@ s .
and that business is agriculture .
the amount of dna data we &apos;ve sequen@@ ced has dou@@ bled every year .
a guy in england called he@@ ston blu@@ men@@ thal , he &apos;s developed his a@@ v@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de cu@@ is@@ ine .
and so they have to find a way -- and they use al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms to do this -- to break up that big thing into a million little transa@@ ctions .
they had voice recor@@ ders and f@@ m trans@@ mit@@ ters .
i called it &quot; three guys and won@@ ho . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
please go cut that piece out . &quot;
it &apos;s a very great pleasure to fly around .
the ability of one to affect many is scaling ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally , and it &apos;s scaling for good and it &apos;s scaling for evil .
right after september 1@@ 1@@ th , last year , i was thinking about pain and the way that we di@@ sper@@ se it , the way that we exci@@ se it from our bodies .
and this is what they un@@ loaded for me : i had four y@@ ak loads of medical supp@@ lies , which are du@@ mp@@ ed in a tent , and here i am trying to ar@@ range things .
sam har@@ r@@ is : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , watching the clo@@ ck ti@@ cking , but the question is : what is volun@@ tary in a context where men have certain expe@@ c@@ tations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t vei@@ l yourself ?
now another problem was that the language in their tex@@ t@@ book was truly in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible .
and those skills include everything from technical skills , if it &apos;s a technology business , to marketing , and sales , and management , and so on .
so now , we can use this coun@@ ting to try and get at much bigger things than dna ori@@ gam@@ i could o@@ ther@@ wise .
go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision .
and again , the humani@@ stic sk@@ et@@ ch , the trans@@ lation into the public space , but this very , very much a part of the ecolo@@ gy .
and i &apos;d like to bring that experience to the des@@ k@@ top .
how many people gave of their time and their exper@@ ti@@ se , and their pati@@ ence , to deal with me ?
students also self-@@ as@@ sem@@ bled , without any kind of inter@@ vention from us , into small study groups .
and it &apos;s exciting . when you see ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as up here talking about his $ 100 computer , the most passionate exciting thing is : here &apos;s a geni@@ us , but he &apos;s got a call@@ ing now .
and this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping ca@@ pt@@ ch@@ as on the internet .
so to the folks from google , thank you .
these kids aren &apos;t using tex@@ t@@ books , they &apos;re not getting one-@@ si@@ ze@@ -@@ fi@@ ts@@ -@@ all le@@ ctures .
and these happen to be my eyes , by the way .
were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about ful@@ fil@@ ling wants -- suddenly ful@@ fil@@ ling needs ?
it gives you an image for every page of the book .
during the s@@ ars epidemi@@ c in beijing quar@@ ant@@ ine did seem to help .
and that &apos;s why we think the animals live longer .
initially , it does some random motion , and then it tries to figure out what it might look like .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to pus@@ h back and up against .
feeling like the world is becoming less friend@@ ly ? social the@@ or@@ ist jon@@ a@@ than zi@@ tt@@ rain beg@@ s to diff@@ fer . the internet , he suggests , is made up of millions of dis@@ interested acts of kind@@ ness , curi@@ o@@ sity and trust .
and as time went by , and i learned more about other things , i think it worked a little better , as far as the results . but i wanted the score of a game to be the by@@ product of these other things , and not the end itself .
and the student has trained this robot to po@@ ur this water into a glass .
the second question was an i@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c word .
it &apos;s that simple .
the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on am@@ d technology ; it &apos;s a micro@@ process@@ or .
now the groups , it &apos;s not like me le@@ ct@@ uring , but what happens is women , they come together -- under the support and gui@@ dance of our ment@@ or mothers -- they come together , and they share their personal experiences .
bill ly@@ ell : would you say that this mechan@@ ism is in part how terror@@ ism actually works to fri@@ gh@@ ten us , and is there some way that we could counter@@ act that ?
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents .
here , you can see where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is , and they bre@@ ed in incredibly dense coloni@@ es .
something that matters . start . do it . we need it .
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night .
your body is covered with fra@@ ct@@ als .
now in the industry -- i don &apos;t know whether you care about this , or how much time i have to go into this .
that &apos;s actually h@@ y .
so , the theater company has the ability to do totally her@@ me@@ tic , ligh@@ t-@@ controlled , so@@ und@@ -@@ controlled , great ac@@ ou@@ stics , great inti@@ ma@@ cy shakespeare , but can also do be@@ ck@@ et@@ t with the sky@@ line of d@@ all@@ as sitting behind it .
able to en@@ sure that that production is safe .
you charge another in@@ mate to clean his cell .
the only thing that they can &apos;t cop@@ y is the actual tra@@ de@@ mark lab@@ el within that piece of appar@@ el .
i am told you will go from here .
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the a@@ is@@ le , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa that has had success in comb@@ ating the epidemi@@ c .
so we &apos;ve talked about the sta@@ tic face and jud@@ ging the sta@@ tic face , but actually , we &apos;re more com@@ fort@@ able with jud@@ ging the moving face .
so we have to re@@ think the way we light our cities .
for sure , it has open@@ ed opportunities .
she grew up on a farm in au@@ stri@@ a , very poor , didn &apos;t have very much education .
now , what usually happens when we &apos;re learning to be min@@ d@@ ful is that we get di@@ stra@@ cted by a thought .
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are un@@ trained can see the difference , and we see here an st se@@ gment el@@ ev@@ ation right after this sharp line .
and if you don &apos;t understand that in your mental model of this stuff , what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysteri@@ ous and for@@ tu@@ it@@ ous , and i think that &apos;s exactly the wrong image for when you &apos;re trying to teach science .
so , technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket .
somewhere in the amaz@@ on forest is the mar@@ ginal tree .
and every dollar that flo@@ ws into that will be spent more effici@@ ently by a fac@@ tor of 10 to 15 . and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .
&quot; i &apos;m 23 , and a re@@ cover@@ ing me@@ th and hero@@ in addi@@ ct , and feel absolutely bl@@ essed to still be alive . &quot;
somebody said the test we &apos;re fac@@ ing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combin@@ ation of an op@@ pos@@ able th@@ um@@ b and a neocortex is a vi@@ able combin@@ ation .
i work for the je@@ t pro@@ pul@@ sion lab . i &apos;m building the next mars rover .
i said , &quot; wow , &quot; again .
this all started when i was age five .
and that bio@@ -@@ re@@ actor will lay down in the wo@@ und bed .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mu@@ tations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynami@@ c inter@@ play between genetic variation , diet , microbes and par@@ asi@@ tes and our imm@@ une response .
if hundreds of people didn &apos;t buy this , we couldn &apos;t put it on the market .
and he &apos;d tell you , &quot; well most people say thri@@ ved , but some people say thro@@ ve . &quot;
in this map from mol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good educational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the opposite .
so that &apos;s how i answer that question .
in a few years , nasa is going to la@@ unch four or five telescop@@ es out to ju@@ pi@@ ter , where there &apos;s less dust , and start looking for earth@@ -like planets , which we cannot see with present technology , nor detect .
so , designers do need to be ma@@ veri@@ cks , because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pret@@ end that either it never exi@@ sted or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it .
but nothing prepar@@ ed us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hun@@ ting .
this is actually a heart valve that we &apos;ve engine@@ ered , and you can see here , we have the structure of the heart valve and we &apos;ve see@@ ded that with cells , and then we exerci@@ se it .
climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world .
ba@@ kin@@ o fas@@ o : b-@@ min@@ us . and so on .
and the o@@ ars kind of became a symbo@@ l of just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits .
if we man@@ age to do that , forget the molecular detail .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
we can see this unique finger@@ print .
god , i &apos;m going to run out of time , so i &apos;ve got@@ ta keep it moving .
then i used fi@@ bers out of my jump@@ er , which i held and stre@@ tched .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop pe@@ eing on her@@ self because so many gro@@ wn soldiers had sho@@ ved themselves inside her .
and i walked up to the bed@@ side of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragi@@ le , obviously in the lat@@ ter phase of active dying .
when i was eight , i wanted to be a mar@@ ine biolo@@ gist .
in the course of this good@@ by@@ e art series , i created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physi@@ cally disp@@ lay .
and it was this which completely revol@@ u@@ tioni@@ zed cyber@@ crime on the web .
he was ultimately ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated , at the age of 7@@ 8 , through dna evidence .
so this robot is actually being comm@@ and@@ ed re@@ mot@@ ely by frank .
and by the way , our to@@ w@@ ns and cities are where they are , and grew where they were because they occu@@ py all the important sites .
so the only thing i can think of is say , &quot; listen . let me tell you a story .
this is the grand caf@@ e here in oxford .
running along this entire 4@@ 2@@ ,000 miles are tens of thousands of active vol@@ can@@ o@@ es .
we &apos;re living in a culture of je@@ t lag , global travel , 2@@ 4@@ -@@ hour business , shift work .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know@@ -@@ how out there .
so again i am a belie@@ ver in the radical architecture .
but if there is an ab@@ normal activity in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus , they may hallu@@ cin@@ ate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
while in the third one , in the call@@ ing , very much likely i would do it also if i wouldn &apos;t be finan@@ cially com@@ pen@@ s@@ ated for it .
so the reality is , is that the engine of corruption , well , it exists far beyond the shor@@ es of countries like equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al guinea or nigeria or turk@@ men@@ i@@ stan .
it was the sor@@ row that &apos;s taken so long .
the day after , when really it became a lot of talking , i said to myself , and my wife said to me , i also want a poster , so this is her .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
it in@@ hal@@ es oxygen , just like we do .
e : gr@@ rr@@ r@@ r .
now if bill clin@@ ton had said , &quot; well , to tell you the truth ... &quot; or richard ni@@ xon &apos;s favorite , &quot; in all c@@ and@@ or ... &quot; he would have been a dead gi@@ ve@@ away for any li@@ es@@ po@@ tter than knows that quali@@ fying language , as it &apos;s called , quali@@ fying language like that , further dis@@ credi@@ ts the subject .
so i went down there with ri@@ ck and li@@ z and kevin , and i &apos;ve got to say , it was the most moving experience of my life .
l@@ p : how on earth did we do that ?
seri@@ ously .
i spent a lot of time in those early years wee@@ ping sil@@ ently in dres@@ sing rooms .
everybody jo@@ ins in , and they feel they own the bank , because they have brought the money in .
so i &apos;m holding it , and i &apos;m about to touch that tube on its sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and when i do , you &apos;ll see biolumin@@ escence coming out .
now we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing one every week .
how does this in-@@ ness , this inn@@ ern@@ ess , this inter@@ i@@ ority of god work ?
today , we know that this future vision didn &apos;t come true .
and so even though there were no cars still in the west village where we lived , my wife sent me out to buy a , you know , a large air filter at the bed bat@@ h and beyond , which was lo@@ cated about 20 blocks away , north .
however , you pick them up and underneath , actually en@@ gra@@ ved in the me@@ tal , are the words , &quot; stol@@ en from virg@@ in atlantic air@@ ways up@@ per@@ -@@ class . &quot;
tod mach@@ over of mit &apos;s media lab is de@@ vot@@ ed to exten@@ ding musi@@ cal expression to everyone , from virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s to am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s , and in the most diver@@ se forms , from op@@ era to video games . he and com@@ pos@@ er dan ell@@ sey shed light on what &apos;s next .
we know because it says so inside the code .
he gave a talk about how education and school kil@@ ls creativity .
it didn &apos;t speak language , but it didn &apos;t matter .
and this can happen in the medical dom@@ ain .
there is first , the present self .
it &apos;s also full of an@@ ch@@ or ten@@ ants at 20 dollars a foot -- tri@@ ple that in the middle of the inner city .
it &apos;s not enough to just appe@@ al to people &apos;s good mo@@ tives .
but there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s even more important , and i think that &apos;s extin@@ ction .
so the total ener@@ ge@@ tic cost of a brain is a simple , linear function of its number of neurons , and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect .
to get to that stage , we genu@@ in@@ ely need to start building dem@@ and in those societies on the ground .
so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s , and become very , very famous after@@ ward .
support research institutions , because knowledge is an important part of wealth cre@@ ation .
we &apos;re at the very beginning of something that , what we &apos;re seeing and the way that mes@@ h companies are coming forward , is invi@@ ting , it &apos;s engaging , but it &apos;s very early .
and the chance that some of it isn &apos;t more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea .
they &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a player , a pro@@ ta@@ gon@@ ist , a partner , rather than a pas@@ sive spect@@ ator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imagination cannot be con@@ ta@@ ined in buildings , and so much of the work they do is si@@ te-@@ specific or out@@ door work .
it made me wonder if there could be a better way -- a way to cir@@ cum@@ vent death and yet deli@@ ver the gift of life that might ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally impact millions of patients worl@@ d@@ wide .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
the members of the associ@@ ation are sho@@ cked to realize that it &apos;s the poet sa@@ mu@@ el taylor col@@ eri@@ dge , who hadn &apos;t even left his house in years until that day .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about today .
the next to@@ ss is a tail -- you get really excited .
so , happy continued success .
but that hospital was over four hours away , and se@@ vi@@ th@@ a didn &apos;t have the means to get there , so her baby died .
educational technology should be introdu@@ ced into remote areas first , and other areas later .
but he says , &quot; we want a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ free world . &quot;
watch . i decide consci@@ ously to raise my arm , and the dam@@ n thing goes up .
when you see me today , i look like the ph@@ an@@ tom of the op@@ era .
mam@@ mo@@ graphy &apos;s the only one that &apos;s been around long enough to have a chance of making that cla@@ im .
no , it &apos;s true . fu@@ ck &apos; em . fu@@ ck &apos; em . you know , i mean .
well , that &apos;s a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it &apos;s getting dark soon and dangerous .
jan@@ ine di gio@@ van@@ n@@ i : what i saw in the war
you should be a one-@@ bu@@ t@@ to@@ ck player . &quot;

because we can create a sculp@@ ture by gather@@ ing dust together , or we can break the sculp@@ ture and get the dust , but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe . &quot;
when i was a diplomat ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating the dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment tre@@ a@@ ties with the so@@ vi@@ et union in gen@@ ev@@ a in the 197@@ 0s , we succe@@ e@@ ded because we understood we shared a de@@ stin@@ y with them .
people who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
two favor@@ i@@ tes , j@@ ill so@@ bu@@ le and juli@@ a swe@@ en@@ ey , team up for a de@@ ligh@@ t@@ ful set that mi@@ xes wi@@ t@@ ty son@@ g@@ writing with a little bit of social comm@@ entary .
but in fact people say , &quot; i don &apos;t recogni@@ ze the people . i can &apos;t form any associ@@ ations . &quot;
it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a caf@@ e ne@@ ar@@ by with exten@@ sion cor@@ ds and char@@ gers to ju@@ ice my multiple devi@@ ces .
it gets me to meet incredible contra@@ ctors like this , j@@ im ell@@ en@@ ber@@ ger from ell@@ en@@ ber@@ ger services .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d because he believed that the function of religion was to uni@@ te people into a group , into a moral community .
i &apos;d like to thank my researcher han@@ nah martin , who is my slide cli@@ cker , who cli@@ cks the sli@@ des , and my wife , professor mary cro@@ ck , who &apos;s the light of my life , is coming on to collect me .
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
this may be the year we er@@ adi@@ cate polio -- that will make it the second disease in history .
now , follow my actions exactly .
anybody in the world can use them .
these are the kinds of les@@ sons -- as aw@@ k@@ ward as it was to be a pretty goo@@ fy teenager , much worse to be a fru@@ strated designer .
and yet , the type of fishing going on today , with p@@ ens , with enormous stakes , is really wi@@ ping blu@@ ef@@ in ecolo@@ gi@@ cally off the planet .
and i was standing just anon@@ ym@@ ously in a swe@@ at@@ shirt , putting my hand on and off of a tras@@ h@@ can to signal the advan@@ c@@ ement .
behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ om@@ ist dan ari@@ ely studies the bu@@ gs in our moral code : the hidden reasons we think it &apos;s ok to che@@ at or ste@@ al . clever studies help make his point that we &apos;re predict@@ ably ir@@ ra@@ tional -- and can be influ@@ enced in ways we can &apos;t gras@@ p .
and if we both say yes , vo@@ il@@ a ! wel@@ come to chromosom@@ ally lin@@ ke@@ din .
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong che@@ cks and bal@@ an@@ ces .
and we got a great group of people to join us -- princi@@ pl@@ ed people with great skills , and inve@@ stors with a vision and values to match ours .
that means it &apos;s completely re@@ mix@@ able . it also means there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ et@@ ary software . all you need is a web browser .
because it just kind of , you know , doesn &apos;t get any more basic than that .
how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mou@@ ths are real stories , you know , are real sentences ?
i turn around , but it &apos;s not a child . it &apos;s a young woman , a little t@@ aller than i , p@@ ale green , am@@ used eyes .
and as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in super@@ markets , and even in fa@@ st-@@ food out@@ lets .
when i asked , &quot; who is that ? &quot;
or the reci@@ pe for the ultimate ja@@ w-@@ dropping ted@@ talk : &quot; fli@@ ck@@ r photos of inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic classi@@ cal com@@ pos@@ er . &quot;
they &apos;re going to have to care in the social program , but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years , then you can wi@@ den that invest@@ or community as more people have confidence in the product .
isn &apos;t it strange to see that the united states first grew the economy , and then gradu@@ ally got rich ?
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you &apos;re eating d@@ ori@@ tos .
over in s@@ win@@ don , the science museum archi@@ ves , there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles bab@@ bage about this analy@@ tical engine .
but it turns out , what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us , when put in certain con@@ tex@@ ts , will actually make very specific mi@@ stakes .
why ? because for free , this isn &apos;t a new technology , this is a letter -- we &apos;re getting a big bang in behavior .
on one side , a mass of a mountain , a life i know .
we knew they worked through ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned trial and error .
in an ide@@ al world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
and as a consequ@@ ence of this disa@@ gre@@ ement , it &apos;s very , very difficult for anyone to say , &quot; i have the right version of islam . &quot;
and that &apos;s my cou@@ sin and my sister &apos;s dog , gab@@ by .
and that is how this difference has come .
now , because i &apos;m a game designer , you might be thinking to yourself , i know what she wants us to do with those minutes , she wants us to spend them playing games .
wanting them is one thing . nee@@ ding them is a shu@@ t@@ down , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up par@@ en@@ tho@@ od will usually de@@ cre@@ ase the ero@@ tic charge .
i am connected to everything and everyone . i was born like that .
see what we &apos;re finding is it &apos;s not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
we were hun@@ gr@@ y .
we can categ@@ ori@@ ze it like that .
how many hard dri@@ ves can you fit in an i@@ ke@@ a store ?
as many of you know , individuals aff@@ li@@ cted with ad@@ h@@ d also have learning dis@@ abilities .
and the same process is just getting under@@ way with ngos in east africa .
this is a song about a creature called a hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird mot@@ h which imi@@ tat@@ es another creature which imi@@ tat@@ es yet another creature .
what was i supposed to ac@@ compli@@ sh in this final act ?
and here &apos;s what we found .
finally , empty space has a temper@@ ature .
hun@@ t@@ ington , west virginia .
country 1 has more tele@@ phones , and country 1 has a longer system of ra@@ il@@ ways .
and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love landsc@@ apes .
and then you &apos;re out on the street , and you don &apos;t know where to go .
so let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
and so what you &apos;re watching is the birth of stars .
i &apos;ve got a great idea that &apos;s going to change the world .
so they made it really easy to find it .
now , in the as@@ han@@ in@@ ka tradition and culture , the pa@@ je is the most important person in the community .
and i said , &quot; bill , i want to hi@@ re you , man .
and equ@@ ally important is the negative version -- &quot; don &apos;t do to others what you would not like them to do to you . &quot;
and here is the long-@@ pro@@ bo@@ sc@@ ed fly that has not gotten any ne@@ c@@ tar from the mi@@ mic , because the mi@@ mic doesn &apos;t give it any ne@@ c@@ tar . it thought it would get some .
this is taken at 20,000 fra@@ mes per second , and i have to give full credit to the bbc cam@@ er@@ am@@ an , tim green , for setting this shot up , because i could never have done this in a million years -- one of the benefits of working with professional cam@@ er@@ am@@ en .
i think that this is the future of interface , it &apos;s the future of music , the future of instru@@ ments .
we want to mini@@ mi@@ ze the distance . we want to contract that gap .
i will live my life happ@@ ily and study hard until i see you , and i promise i will not c@@ ry again .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
but i think there &apos;s something else going on .
the third compon@@ ent of co@@ ke &apos;s success is marketing .
lau@@ rie gar@@ re@@ tt : les@@ sons from the 19@@ 18 flu
he looks like this .
like , you can feel inten@@ se pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot .
kamen said , &quot; free cultur@@ es get what they celebra@@ te . &quot;
i ate really small controlled por@@ tions throughout the day .
so my femin@@ ism is very inde@@ b@@ ted to my mom &apos;s , but it looks very different .
if you happen to live close to the desert bor@@ der , you can pretty much calcu@@ late how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away , and ab@@ and@@ on your home and your life as you know it .
and i came across this little street in ven@@ ice , where the comm@@ un@@ ist head@@ quar@@ ters were sharing a wall with this ca@@ tholic s@@ hr@@ ine .
and i had a bit of a wa@@ ke@@ -up call in am@@ ster@@ da@@ m : i was there going into the design stores , and mix@@ ing with our crowd of designers , and i recogni@@ zed that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same , and the effect of globali@@ zation has had that in our community also .
this is the head of u.k. trade and investment , who was our cli@@ ent , with the chinese children , using the landscape .
and it was necessary in some way for these to con@@ tradi@@ ct each other , and as a consequ@@ ence you have to make friends wh@@ er@@ ever you can get them .
they say , &quot; you &apos;re not going to finish college .
those are mean@@ ings that are ac@@ qui@@ red as part of their shared experiences with others .
well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of inter@@ action .
and i leave feeling actually un@@ happy .
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
i &apos;m not going to explain what that for@@ mul@@ a is , but it &apos;s very beautiful .
but in any case , that was more than 100 years ago .
now , what stephen hawking men@@ tioned , as well , is that after the big bang , space exp@@ and@@ ed at a very rapid rate .
the second one was the san francisco bay area where ga@@ vin new@@ so@@ m created a beautiful policy across all the may@@ ors .
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree .
he talked in detail about travel .
the financial crisis is really a rela@@ tively small historic phenomenon , which has just acceler@@ ated this huge shift , which ends half a mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um of western as@@ cen@@ dan@@ cy .
this is a hospital building .
we have to choose that path .
and for more and more of us , home has really less to do with a piece of soil than , you could say , with a piece of soul .
and if we record from lots of different neurons , we &apos;ll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment , like in this square box shown here .
and this is really where the wir@@ es come right up into the city .
that &apos;s our libr@@ ary with more hand@@ cra@@ fted furniture .
one of the problems of writing , and working , and looking at the internet is that it &apos;s very hard to separate fashion from deep change .
you signed it , &quot; they were wrong . &quot;
this is my global public de@@ bt clo@@ ck , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 3@@ 2 trilli@@ on and coun@@ ting .
guys are fl@@ aming out academi@@ cally ; they &apos;re wi@@ ping out soci@@ ally with girls and sexu@@ ally with women .
it &apos;s like science has become that horri@@ ble story@@ teller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody car@@ es about , where you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , i met my friend for l@@ unch the other day , and she was wearing these u@@ gly je@@ ans .
they have enough income for three families .
but some countries re@@ main back in this area here .
this is my favorite word , by the way .
for those of you with kid@@ do@@ s at home , how would you like to have the wir@@ eless dia@@ per that suppor@@ ts your ...
or maybe your bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
between 1960 and 2003 , our contin@@ ent received 600 billion dollars of aid , and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in africa .
the prin@@ ter lost the fi@@ le , didn &apos;t tell us .
now , because i know -- -- ok , i as@@ sume that answers my question .
some , it &apos;s quite hard to tell why .
you &apos;ve got to get out of there .
we really are seeing the da@@ wn of inter@@ ven@@ tional surgery .
thank you .
and ken &#91; shar@@ pe &#93; and i certainly know that you need to rei@@ g@@ n in the ban@@ kers .
for years i &apos;ve been feeling fru@@ strated , because as a religious histori@@ an , i &apos;ve become acu@@ tely aware of the cent@@ r@@ ality of compassion in all the major world fai@@ ths .
the movie folks also tell us that our economy lo@@ ses over 3@@ 7@@ 0,000 jobs to content the@@ ft , which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in &apos; 98 , the bu@@ re@@ au of labor statistics indi@@ cated that the motion picture and video industri@@ es were emplo@@ ying 2@@ 7@@ 0,000 people .
there are many where this paradig@@ m can now play , but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the so@@ f@@ ter side .
and really interesting stuff .
fish do not sit in seats .
&quot; and the da@@ wn came . &quot; so they ran all night .
i came up with this structure here .
and i thought , &quot; well , of course i believe in god , but , you know , i don &apos;t like that word , heart , because it anthropo@@ mor@@ phi@@ zes god , and i don &apos;t like the word , &apos; his , &apos; either , because that sexu@@ ali@@ zes god . &quot;
and think of it being done with just a few people .
you need to discover the general principles of nature , and then use these analo@@ gi@@ es when they &apos;re advan@@ ta@@ geous .
and some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube , you can put two mat@@ ch@@ sticks inside this , and you make a flexible jo@@ int .
wh@@ ere@@ as now , second ge@@ ar -- it &apos;s like africa had first ge@@ ar , now they go into second ge@@ ar .
bab@@ ble@@ .com publi@@ sher@@ s ruf@@ us gri@@ s@@ com and ali@@ sa volk@@ man , in a li@@ vely ta@@ g-@@ team , ex@@ pose 4 facts that parents never , ever ad@@ mit -- and why they should . funny and hon@@ est , for parents and non@@ parents ali@@ ke .
and let &apos;s add satellite con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion .
and i asked myself , why ?
now we all know that bones are fossi@@ li@@ zed , and so if you du@@ mp it into ac@@ id , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
this is a project that we just finished in pen@@ ang for a very , very large city project that came directly out of this process , which is the result of the multi@@ pli@@ city of forces that produce it .
what if technologies could inter@@ ven@@ e to help me find the person that i need right now ?
is it really needed ?
but this is not ground water .
this is one of their fo@@ under@@ s , gert sch@@ a@@ eff@@ er .
and one quick example is ve@@ li@@ b , in 2007 , came forward in paris with a very b@@ old pro@@ position , a very big bi@@ ke@@ -@@ sharing service .
12 people have stood on the moon .
now there are still many problems .
you can do it by being more spiritual .
and you can understand how different it &apos;s going to be , the image of rio with the system -- one-@@ minute frequ@@ ency .
and somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming .
basically , we get it out of min@@ es .
well as it says in my introdu@@ ction , i &apos;ve gotten some@@ what known for saying that patients should have access to their data .
i was told later , and also by lots of sing@@ ers who were involved in this , that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they up@@ loaded it .
and she put her head back and she said , &quot; it feels like lea@@ ping into hea@@ ven . &quot;
because some cycle , there is a spot in the cycle , and you have not the same du@@ ty in the different parts of the cycle .
but i &apos;ve got to say , in first grade , they said i talked too much , and now i still can .
have you yourself experienced any of the syn@@ dro@@ mes you write about ?
less than four percent actually go back to ja@@ il .
first of all , i agree with mu@@ di@@ m@@ be &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; the inven@@ tion of africa , &quot; that africa is an artifi@@ cial inven@@ tion of first coloni@@ ali@@ sm , and then op@@ posi@@ tional mov@@ ements .
there is a teen@@ age girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 5@@ 6 stars tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on the right side of her face .
you go through some addi@@ tional che@@ cks , and then they open the door .
and i decided to try to get smar@@ ter by read@@ ing the entire en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia britan@@ ni@@ ca from a to z -- or , more preci@@ sely , from &quot; a-@@ ak &quot; to &quot; zy@@ wie@@ c . &quot;
so what does that mean ? when you think about power , people ten@@ ded to think only about te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , because that was about dom@@ in@@ ance .
and the data is very clear .
is there one piece in the puzzle which might wra@@ p all these things up ?
a par@@ ap@@ hrase of a quote by virginia wo@@ ol@@ f , and there &apos;s some de@@ ba@@ te as to what she actually meant by that .
this is the number one high resol@@ ution , most preci@@ se spect@@ ro@@ graph on this planet , called har@@ ps , which is actually used to detect ex@@ tras@@ ol@@ ar planets and sound waves in the atmosp@@ heres of stars .
what it pro@@ ves to us is that people don &apos;t buy what you do ; people buy why you do it .
250 -- ex@@ cu@@ se me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .
we all have different prefer@@ ences , different needs .
unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot;
what under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed this shame , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blank enough . i &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , pro@@ mot@@ ed enough . &quot;
it &apos;s got no refle@@ ctive symme@@ try .
blo@@ g about it , t@@ we@@ et about it , talk about it , and com@@ mit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
the only working piece of equipment in my kit@@ chen was a can cru@@ sher , because if it didn &apos;t come in a can , it came fro@@ zen in a box .
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about dis@@ connection .
here are the gu@@ ards with the symb@@ ols of power and anon@@ y@@ mi@@ ty .
so if you ever feel like you don &apos;t have this aging thing quite pe@@ g@@ ged , don &apos;t ki@@ ck yourself .
so if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we evolved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you &apos;ve got it back@@ wards ; that &apos;s just wrong . it &apos;s the other way ro@@ und .
but there &apos;s this consequ@@ ence out there .
so , what the hell .
this is a horse ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t .
well , yeah , a lot of them .
the second chapter consi@@ sts of a complicated legal proce@@ eding known as a state hab@@ e@@ as cor@@ pu@@ s appe@@ al .
we hope that the embra@@ ce inf@@ ant war@@ mer and other simple innova@@ tions like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , lo@@ c@@ alized , aff@@ ord@@ able solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
and i think you &apos;ll have a better and more em@@ power@@ ed life .
i mean , if there &apos;s stuff on google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
i &apos;m going to try to pus@@ h it inside your hand .
let &apos;s not tell you emplo@@ yer .
i think , were he able to look at the evidence we have today , he would understand it .
ya@@ ho@@ o news , the biggest news site on the internet , is now person@@ alized -- different people get different things .
i want you to watch a short video from my lat@@ est docum@@ entary film , &quot; children of the taliban . &quot;
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai@@ ve .
it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work , and it was used in a project where we could un@@ ra@@ vel that surface , and it was a figu@@ ra@@ tive idea that was going to be fol@@ ded and made into a very , kind of complex space .
so each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
biology doesn &apos;t care about the design unless it works .
suddenly , they started fighting .
they could hear things , smell things , see things i couldn &apos;t see .
now , as a scientist , what &apos;s the evidence for this ?
i got these hin@@ ts everywhere .
all that is a real , great improv@@ ement , as we shall see .
r@@ f : here &apos;s it going down a path@@ way .
so , i hope that we can also keep some of these &quot; hope spots &quot; in the deep sea .
and indeed , i was very far from the mark .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the kni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p .
and we &apos;re doing it again .
it was the ad@@ vi@@ ce that i decided to follow myself when i turned 40 .
and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for ration@@ ality .
and they can be model@@ ed by a spr@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &apos;re bi@@ ome@@ chan@@ i@@ sts . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
it &apos;s in that context that i work .
im : just che@@ cking , because some people want to look , you know , ag@@ gr@@ essi@@ vely u@@ gly .
i have ph@@ le@@ bi@@ ti@@ s at the moment , in both legs , and that &apos;s the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here , because i have parkinson &apos;s disease in addition to that , and some other problems that i won &apos;t talk about .
it &apos;s also , by the way , a charac@@ teri@@ stic of certain kinds of brain damage .
we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the north@@ ern he@@ mi@@ sphere , watching what &apos;s happened .
we want to hear about that man who spo@@ ke with a voice of th@@ under , who laugh@@ ed like the sun@@ rise , who came from that place called america , which is so far from here , that if a young man should travel there , he would be an old man when he arri@@ ved .
and , of course , if you don &apos;t have any surface , you can start using your pal@@ m for simple oper@@ ations .
so in fe@@ bru@@ ary of 200@@ 9 , dr. zu@@ ll@@ inger invi@@ ted us , project h design -- which is a non-@@ profit design fir@@ m that i fo@@ unded -- to come to ber@@ tie and to partner with him on the re@@ pair of this school distri@@ ct and to bring a design perspective to the re@@ pair of the school distri@@ ct .
&quot; ez a mi mun@@ kan@@ k ; es ne@@ m is kev@@ es . yo na@@ pot , pac@@ ak ! &quot;
i &apos;ve walked about 4,000 kilome@@ ters in the last 12 years .
and scientists , a@@ mid@@ st complexity , a@@ mid@@ st flu@@ ctu@@ ation and uni@@ qu@@ eness .
gu@@ th@@ rie adap@@ ted it into &quot; this land is your land . &quot;
the equation is hidden there , z goes into z squ@@ ared , plus c .
just because you know what to do doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re always going to do it .
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it &apos;s a simple &quot; not equal . &quot;
there you go . nasa &apos;s really cool . they have these hyper@@ -@@ spec@@ tra@@ l images that are fal@@ se-@@ col@@ ored so you can -- it &apos;s really good for determin@@ ing vege@@ ta@@ tive use . well , let &apos;s go back to this .
good news : chari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
and as you can see , we have a pat@@ ch@@ work across this ocean .
and the light that sh@@ one off of her eyes was a place i could have stayed forever .
i &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
so don &apos;t put it in the front door ; put it somewhere else .
every time you read it or say it , you make another cop@@ y in your brain .
our brain wei@@ gh@@ s between 1.@@ 2 and 1.@@ 5 ki@@ los , but elephant brains wei@@ gh between four and five ki@@ los , and whale brains can wei@@ gh up to nine ki@@ los , which is why scientists used to res@@ ort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities .
as you can see , there are two invent@@ ors with identical contra@@ p@@ tions in their la@@ p , meeting in the waiting room of a pat@@ ent at@@ tor@@ ney .
all of these represent ga@@ ps between potential mind and actual mind .
it becomes your eyes and e@@ ars as you vent@@ ure into the deep .
well , 5@@ 8 percent said yes , which i think is over@@ in@@ fl@@ ated though because so many men if you just say , &quot; have you ever had sex ... &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot;
but , hey , at least it &apos;s hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic .
i know nothing . i &apos;m a beginn@@ er .
and she -- after some time , she said she wanted to think about that .
this is not the very distant future .
and each one of those is really kind of su@@ mming up the most important things for the united states at that time .
am : and previ@@ ously , you need a multi@@ million investment for machine and all . now , any rural woman can .
thanks .
then it came way down .
where &apos;s this going ? i think you can see it already .
it &apos;s basically like trying to breathe , as a doctor said , while having an elephant standing on your ch@@ est .
&quot; a@@ ah , ha , oh , he just cros@@ sed over the top of my head about , oh , i don &apos;t know , just so close . &quot;
that leads to produ@@ ctivity .
ok , well , we fight .
we tried it against flu a viruses -- h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 , h@@ 3@@ n@@ 2 -- as well as flu b viruses .
so , in doing so , you &apos;re er@@ as@@ ing time .
and then taking this idea of creating a very deta@@ iled structure , we can apply it to hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b structures and use them within im@@ plants .
it turned out that they were aware , as no one else within the company was , of a technological bli@@ p that neither the fore@@ casting experts , nor the experts on the ground in china , were even aware of .
there are all other sorts of appli@@ cations , mer@@ ging your phone and diagno@@ stics , for example -- meas@@ uring your blood gl@@ u@@ co@@ se on your iphone and sending that , poten@@ tially , to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sug@@ ars as a diab@@ e@@ tic .
we connect the d@@ ots : a is connected to b ; b is connected to c .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st inge miss@@ ma@@ hl visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wo@@ unds of war -- wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad des@@ pair , trauma and depression . and yet , in this coun@@ ty of 30 million people , there were only two do@@ zen psychi@@ at@@ ri@@ sts . miss@@ ma@@ hl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psy@@ cho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , pro@@ mot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national heal@@ ing .
did you touch it ?
and coming back to the car , i always used to say that the car is like your mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she cannot comm@@ and your life .
this is people desig@@ ning their own experiences .
low-@@ cost family restaurant cha@@ in , for those of you who don &apos;t know it .
the archi@@ me@@ des text is dark in one image and bright in another .
how much would it cost in a book@@ store ?
and i think if you start a business without financial bac@@ king , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that divi@@ ding line .
so you might say , let &apos;s go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals , or in the end of the peri@@ pher@@ al ner@@ ve and record them there .
and they could all sit and work together on those problems .
today , the practi@@ c@@ ali@@ ties of making such an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the ma@@ gni@@ tude of the information put into it , are within reach .
we basically did a stri@@ pte@@ ase , architectural stri@@ pte@@ ase , where we &apos;re fra@@ ming with this kind of canopy -- the under@@ side of three levels of expansion of ju@@ illi@@ ard , about 4@@ 5,000 square feet -- cu@@ tting it to the angle of broad@@ way , and then ex@@ pos@@ ing , using that canopy to frame tu@@ l@@ ly hall .
if you &apos;re an accoun@@ t@@ ant , and a bo@@ x-@@ ti@@ cker , the only thing you can do in these cir@@ cum@@ stances is buy cheaper sh@@ it .
now that led to an understanding of at@@ omi@@ c structure because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is at@@ oms are a single nu@@ cle@@ us with elec@@ tr@@ ons going around them .
so i came back to new@@ castle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that defini@@ tely was getting very serious .
so , as manufac@@ turing starts to allow more design options , this problem gets exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated , of the whole and the parts .
just because people can &apos;t see us doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re going to necessarily lie .
go out . isn &apos;t it beautiful ? isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
let &apos;s sett@@ le for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
and both in he@@ ter@@ o@@ sexu@@ als -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users , you &apos;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment beg@@ ins , and that &apos;s because of that ali@@ gn@@ ment of in@@ centi@@ ves that i talked about earlier .
and i was a guinea pi@@ g , as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthe@@ tic lim@@ bs that come out .
my challenge has not been the traff@@ i@@ ck@@ ers who beat me up .
this forming of the powerful atta@@ ch@@ ment between child and par@@ ent provi@@ des the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or development .
the lo@@ cation of this tree is actually kept secret for its own prote@@ ction .
c@@ b : looks very good to me .
even though they were lab@@ el@@ ed whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
it means being able to obser@@ ve our thought stream and the process of emotion with high cl@@ ari@@ ty , obje@@ ctivity and from a thir@@ d-@@ person perspective .
and that &apos;s where it &apos;s actually also interesting to think about , where does 4@@ 0@@ 4 come from ?
and later a black hole was formed in a bin@@ ary system , which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses .
well , i &apos;ve more or less said what i wanted .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sex@@ y and elegan@@ t , it &apos;s hidden .
as a child , i had a pretty normal life : i would go to school , play with my friends and cou@@ sins .
now , this is sou@@ the@@ ast africa . it makes it look like there are sort of two bre@@ eding peri@@ ods here . it &apos;s slightly more complicated than that .
co@@ smi@@ c mira@@ cles are something which can be related to seti .
ne@@ pt@@ une &apos;s probably not very big in your life .
now i have done the impossible not once , but many times .
and that &apos;s basically what we are . we &apos;re just human beings , but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were , that make up these extraordinary person@@ ali@@ ties and charac@@ ters and interests and things .
and initially , that ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olo@@ gist would be ba@@ ff@@ led .
i was like ni@@ ke should hi@@ re him , you know , &quot; just do it ! &quot;
would you just give us a little t@@ wir@@ l , please , co@@ sta ?
they are both right now on the run .
knowing , that &apos;s what di@@ st@@ ingu@@ i@@ shes us from the apes .
they &apos;re litt@@ ler computers , so the one-@@ chip computers , i began to program one-@@ chip computers and make objects out of p@@ .@@ c. bo@@ ards , le@@ ds .
she &apos;s right here and she said , &quot; you &apos;re the shame researcher who had the break@@ down . &quot;
families need the help .
some of my favorite examples : in transportation , car@@ po@@ ol@@ ing@@ .@@ com@@ . ten years old , three and a half million people have jo@@ ined up , and a million ri@@ des are shared every day .
and just for ki@@ cks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and weight ga@@ in software to see how he would look .
talk about evil pre@@ vail@@ ing . i mean , here he was in the room with the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of evil in cam@@ bo@@ dia .
because not many people are really going to read archi@@ me@@ des in ancient gre@@ ek , but they should have the chance to do it .
but also i in@@ tend to stick with the volun@@ te@@ ering , which actually leads me to the biggest epi@@ ph@@ any of them all .
literally sc@@ ra@@ m@@ bling through what &apos;s called pressure ice -- the ice had been sm@@ ash@@ ed up under the pressure of the curr@@ ents of the ocean , the wind and the ti@@ des .
that &apos;s why we build space shu@@ tt@@ les and ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extra@@ ct ter@@ mit@@ es .
and since richard put me on this whole thing with music -- i &apos;m supposed to actually be doing a project with tod mach@@ over with the mit media lab -- it rel@@ ates a lot to music .
as long as our books are written in english -- because people are re@@ writing them and re@@ cop@@ ying them -- it &apos;s going to be there .
now , when you approach these animals , you need to understand there &apos;s a dangerous end to them , and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of war@@ iness .
and that &apos;s where i need my assi@@ stant here now .
the light never goes out .
we really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
we are the first society to be living in a world where we don &apos;t wor@@ ship anything other than ourselves .
the target market is as temp@@ ting as it can get .
i &apos;ll show you by dra@@ wing a simple picture .
it has 300 options , i &apos;m pa@@ ying for 300 ; i &apos;m using only three but i &apos;m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up .
universal city walk versus disney world , or dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
so when i got this e@@ mail from dr. gei@@ ger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
if you think about it , the bo@@ w has really helped drive human survival since pre@@ historic times .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
and you can p@@ ause it and step back and forth and see different ph@@ ases .
now we don &apos;t know if it says hollywood , or even b@@ oll@@ ywood for that matter .
and the idea he had was to establi@@ sh a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart &apos;s content .
is there any dou@@ bt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
and one thing i &apos;ve learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and i love that .
when you &apos;re beginning to rot a little bit , all of the videos cra@@ mm@@ ed into your head , all of the exten@@ sions that extend your various powers , are going to being to seem a little secon@@ dar@@ y .
and if you &apos;re wearing clothing , you &apos;ve taken off your clothing , and re@@ move the radiation that would be -- the radio@@ active material that might be on you .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agre@@ ement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of per@@ su@@ ading the whole of the world to move along a cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ change agen@@ da .
thank you very much .
the libr@@ ari@@ ans were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
nee@@ d@@ less to say , i was dra@@ stically wrong .
and i said , &quot; not just married . let &apos;s invi@@ te everyone who &apos;s helped us , all the people who bought our work . &quot;
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an inter@@ vention to improve re@@ co@@ very and people &apos;s quality of life .
and what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff ?
and at the same time , there was a problem in the city with over@@ flo@@ wing ce@@ me@@ ter@@ ies .
and with that in mind , i &apos;d like to say a few words about traditional college gra@@ ding .
chil@@ d-@@ pro@@ di@@ gy piano player , he started on the squee@@ ze@@ box , and moved to a little more serious issue , a bigger instrument , and now to an even larger instrument , upon which to work his particular brand of de@@ constru@@ cti@@ v@@ ist magic , as you see here .
now , what &apos;s really going on ?
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even greater .
elec@@ tr@@ ons disappear in a kind of fu@@ zz , and there is only energy . and you can &apos;t see energy .
i walked the 10 kilome@@ ters back and it was the shor@@ test walk i ever had .
and it has@@ n &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally priv@@ y information just for ted .
and they turned at once and walked away .
each of the parts can be easily li@@ fted with no ho@@ ist .
the next great stage , which all of you are so familiar with : the massive information revolution .
international organizations have invest@@ ed a lot in alb@@ ani@@ a during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
another moti@@ vation , of course , is climate change .
and so in the rever@@ se engineering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re familiar with , for the texti@@ le industry , the texti@@ le industry goes and un@@ win@@ ds the co@@ co@@ on and then wea@@ ves glam@@ or@@ ous things .
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resili@@ ence over time , there &apos;s a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .
we thought we &apos;d just send it to people and see how the mole@@ cule beha@@ ves .
i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laborat@@ ory .
can you imagine what it would be like if amaz@@ on or e@@ bay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
if you were lucky enough to be a weal@@ thy busin@@ ess@@ man or an influ@@ enti@@ al journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone .
thank you .
engineer : absolutely . interviewer : you thought , &quot; oh , bo@@ ther . &quot;
therefore at ga@@ p@@ min@@ der we made our own map , and it looks like this .
so i was cru@@ shing up these pieces of glass , which , as you can see , that &apos;s the actual frame of the house .
it puts you into this special , special world .
the c@@ d@@ c recently condu@@ cted a sur@@ v@@ ey where they asked respon@@ dents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psych@@ ological di@@ stress in the previ@@ ous week .
you know , culture was born of the imagination , and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species des@@ cen@@ ded from our pro@@ gen@@ it@@ or , hom@@ o ere@@ ctu@@ s , and , inf@@ used with consciousness , began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habit@@ able world .
so , what we are trying to do in our explor@@ ation is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today .
that &apos;s not only to cen@@ sor you .
because women are on the ground floor , and we know the tradi@@ tions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table .
i didn &apos;t know .
now , we risk@@ ed richard &apos;s life , it &apos;s only fair we risk our own lives .
c : this is the gun .
because it has to end .
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had em@@ power@@ ed that , and that blo@@ gging was something that she felt com@@ fort@@ able doing , and that the idea that blo@@ gging doesn &apos;t have to be sc@@ ary , that we don &apos;t always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people .
and these be@@ co@@ s are normally very crow@@ ded , and people hum@@ p furniture up them , or re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators up them , all sorts of things .
right ? they did .
so you &apos;re feeding it with more material -- cu@@ bes in this case -- and more energy , and it can make another robot .
technology is an instrument that allowed me to mani@@ fest my visions in high definition , live , on stage .
because that is what juli@@ an as@@ s@@ ange did .
for me , the issue about aid -- i don &apos;t think that afri@@ cans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics proper@@ ly .
well , we got the answer on the 2@@ 8@@ th fe@@ bru@@ ary &apos; 5@@ 3 .
he comes for a tum@@ my ru@@ b , because he belie@@ ves that will give me lu@@ ck .
so here &apos;s one .
it &apos;s too in sil@@ ence .
as op@@ posed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well-@@ known office , which is the white group .
so what do i have to do ?
by 2030 , if the mai@@ ze , or corn , vari@@ eties , which is the dom@@ in@@ ant cro@@ p -- 50 percent of the nutri@@ tion in south@@ ern africa are still in the field -- in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in production of mai@@ ze because of the climate change already in 2030 .
so it &apos;s really very successful teaching children that they have a her@@ i@@ tage that &apos;s about mathematics , that it &apos;s not just about singing and dan@@ cing .
this is sort of a 7@@ -@@ el@@ even for time travel@@ ers .
and the same problem with respect to islam .
how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
there was this wonderful re@@ view in the new york times about the min@@ i co@@ op@@ er automo@@ bi@@ le .
we have been so con@@ sum@@ ed with seem@@ ingly obje@@ ctive disc@@ us@@ sions of politics , t@@ ac@@ tics , weapons , dollars and cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties .
i will show how the cap@@ ill@@ ary action works , how it fee@@ ds , i &apos;ll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .
so it helped me understand industrial agriculture , which of course is a car@@ te@@ si@@ an system .
they &apos;re going to say , in regions of profound inst@@ ability throughout the world , where you have inten@@ se poverty , where popu@@ lations are growing and you don &apos;t have sustainable resources like this , this is going to lead to food inse@@ curity .
so with simple electronics , you can detect how much the page is being b@@ ent .
x , y and also z .
i mean , these sort of top-@@ down , mon@@ o-@@ functional , capi@@ tal@@ -@@ inten@@ sive solutions are really not going to cut it .
and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year .
i inter@@ view and do por@@ tra@@ its .
the first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today , both because of the in@@ puts , which are becoming massive , and because of the plasti@@ city of the organ , is the brain .
studies say that tens of thousands of american grand@@ mothers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mothers and fa@@ thers might be around for another birthday if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
i don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot;
