i &apos;m sure she never found the dog , because i took the sign .
thank you very much .
i came this close to changing species at that moment .
let me offer you another building block to try and understand china -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
how many of us have children or grand@@ children , ni@@ ec@@ es , ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws ?
i have to tell it , because there was no one to put two and two together .
if they agree -- and you don &apos;t want to know what happens if they don &apos;t -- they train them and they super@@ v@@ ise them on how to run the most efficient crimin@@ al operation for that town , in ex@@ change for ro@@ y@@ al@@ ties .
and about three years later , when i left the hospital , i started studying at the university .
now , there is a way of looking at play that i also want to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze here , which is the play history .
these so@@ y@@ be@@ ans are being shi@@ pped to europe and to china as animal feed , especially after the mad co@@ w disease sc@@ are about a decade ago , where we don &apos;t want to feed animals animal prot@@ ein anymore , because that can trans@@ mit disease .
now , traditional sector is where africa produ@@ ces its agriculture , which is one of the reasons why africa can &apos;t feed itself , and that &apos;s why it must imp@@ ort food .
so this is how you vote .
and iron@@ ically , i think it &apos;s probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed onto my body -- par@@ tly as a wri@@ ter , but also just as a human being .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called &quot; the hot zone . &quot; it was all about the outbreak of the e@@ b@@ ola virus .
that &apos;s what that ar@@ row means .
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
and in kenya , it &apos;s a very different reality , and one thing that rema@@ ins despite the le@@ aps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem .
there &apos;s fi@@ gs and everything else there for the taking .
listen to this : less than four@@ -@@ ten@@ ths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise de@@ fau@@ l@@ ted on treatment .
and then six months later , or nine months after the problem had taken , i got this del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful letter with a picture of the baby asking if i &apos;d be go@@ d@@ father , which i became .
those of us who believe in hea@@ ven have some sort of idea of what hea@@ ven would be .
all of us are refuge@@ es .
tag@@ ging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classi@@ fication .
my challenge has not been the traff@@ i@@ ck@@ ers who be@@ at me up .
i had an explosion .
and we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that &apos;s most important of all -- looking good , feeling good and having the goo@@ ds .
what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cam@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a law@@ yer and you have a right not to be tor@@ tured .
i either convin@@ ce cli@@ ents at the end that i solve their problems , or i really do solve their problems , because usually they seem to like it .
they were horri@@ fied when they discovered they &apos;d really been left out all the time because the shows were ri@@ g@@ ged .
thank you very much .
and nature &apos;s favorite solution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
in fact , it was always done man@@ ual .
he main@@ ta@@ ined a cal@@ m in@@ sou@@ ci@@ ance .
so everybody got an en@@ vel@@ op@@ e with all the money for the experiment , and we told them that at the end , we asked them to pay us back the money they didn &apos;t make . ok ?
it spre@@ ads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time cor@@ r@@ all@@ ing it .
ma@@ har@@ a@@ ja : nothing to worry about , not a thing .
it would have the inter@@ discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ity of the ted conference .
what happened ? the industrial revolution , which meant that all of a sudden , europe and america became the dominant center of the world .
so , people are getting their hands dirty . they are roll@@ ing up their sle@@ ev@@ es .
we was@@ h the bug out .
because this drag@@ on@@ fly has a rather amazing story to tell .
65 million comp@@ act flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent light bul@@ bs were sold last year .
i feature ble@@ mis@@ h .
and i meet them at the university , i also have a few field off@@ ices that i set up in various places that provide an immer@@ sion in some of the environmental challenges we face .
so , according to this , the austr@@ ali@@ ans and the japanese as well as the mexic@@ ans are very happy .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to rel@@ ate to the world these days , i actually made a device called the glac@@ ier embra@@ cing suit .
i was in these ven@@ ues , and people were , you know , really into getting them . they were excited .
because i don &apos;t want them dis@@ crimin@@ ated against anymore . &quot;
we started talking with them and i was ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating .
because she fell in love with walter r@@ alei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then walter r@@ alei@@ gh fell in love with her la@@ dy in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
and second , there was no question of the initial state of the universe .
it &apos;s been estim@@ ated that two thirds of the mel@@ o@@ dies dy@@ l@@ an used in his early songs were bor@@ ro@@ wed .
you know , anybody who &apos;s read a children &apos;s book knows that love makes things real .
you hold on to the roots , you put your foot in the little rocks and clim@@ b up there , and you get to the top , and i was with a good friend who was an ac@@ tor , and we said , &quot; let &apos;s go up there .
&quot; and , baby , &quot; i &apos;ll tell her , don &apos;t keep your nose up in the air like that .
never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people .
and we finally have the studies , one in bri@@ tain called &quot; gl@@ u@@ tt@@ ony versus sl@@ oth &quot; that tra@@ cked weight against di@@ et and tra@@ cked weight against in@@ activity , and found a much higher , stron@@ ger cor@@ relation between the lat@@ ter two .
we can see all the way out to the edge of the obser@@ vable universe , all the way back in time , almost to the moment of the big bang itself .
i &apos;ll just put that list up for a few seconds , and see if you can guess which two -- i would estimate that probably two of these top@@ ics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various re@@ vie@@ ws and radio interviews .
one of the most effective anti-@@ smo@@ king ads was done by the department of health services , showing that nic@@ ot@@ ine , which con@@ stri@@ cts your ar@@ ter@@ ies , can cause a heart attack or a stro@@ ke , but it also causes imp@@ ot@@ ence .
and we came up with this idea of issu@@ ing bon@@ ds , press freedom bon@@ ds .
i &apos;m just going to list some of them .
it &apos;s turning green here because it feels that everything is just right .
ok , here we go .
or , i want to look at an@@ xiety , because people are pra@@ ying for an@@ xiety .
and you &apos;re waiting for re@@ covery as you were waiting for the christ@@ mas day .
can we run that , and@@ re@@ w ?
a remarkable , remarkable te@@ stam@@ ent to the power of evolution .
&quot; you &apos;re talking to me already . what &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work so well anymore either .
thank you .
femin@@ ism was the water i grew up in .
but you can understand why there may be forces in the bre@@ ast@@ -@@ ima@@ ging world who pre@@ fer the status qu@@ o .
they &apos;re starting to talk about , &quot; how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas ?
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
at any rate , when i was a boy , i , like , for inst@@ ance , i had this -- i got this little book from fort si@@ ll , o@@ kla@@ hom@@ a -- this is about the time that george dy@@ son &apos;s dad thinking about blo@@ wing up nuclear rock@@ ets and stuff .
i think we &apos;re going to end up , in the next few years , to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another .
i could decide that i &apos;m hun@@ gry but know that it &apos;s not a great time to eat .
half of e@@ .@@ r@@ . ad@@ mis@@ sions from adol@@ esc@@ ents are for conc@@ us@@ sions .
so we used ultra@@ vio@@ let a , which doesn &apos;t make vitamin d .
it &apos;s the home@@ bre@@ w computer clu@@ b -- just like a h@@ ack@@ er@@ space .
and apart from a few very important lo@@ ose ends , which you &apos;ve heard about here -- like dark energy and dark matter -- this equ@@ ation describes , seems to describe everything about the universe and what &apos;s in it .
and that is a fe@@ at that we are not really consci@@ ous of that much .
if i &apos;m cooking , the door is shu@@ t , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in i get anno@@ yed .
but one more added feature .
well , you can &apos;t see it .
they bring it back and feed it to the lar@@ va@@ e .
what are we doing ?
so i run right up@@ sta@@ irs .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move during the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they &apos;re moving .
seven years ago , an even faster and che@@ aper american manufac@@ turing technology was used to make this little carbon fi@@ ber test part , which dou@@ bles as a carbon cap .
for everybody else , we go around like we &apos;ve been having sex since we were two .
so for a few hours , it all passed through china .
as a truck driver once said to me , he said , &quot; the world had a new center , and that center was mary an@@ ne . &quot;
from playing with it , they learn some basic principles about fire , about in@@ take , about com@@ bu@@ sti@@ on , about ex@@ hau@@ st .
and we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess predi@@ ction .
so we have b , a , g , f@@ . and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ? oh , that might have been a flu@@ ke .
in reality , many cho@@ ices are between things that are not that much different .
are you guys ready again -- &quot; the gradu@@ ate &quot; ?
but this team of multi@@ -@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary , highly skep@@ tical and ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly tal@@ ented resear@@ ch@@ ers do agree on two things .
i found s@@ mi@@ le@@ y@@ gir@@ l@@ 197@@ 8 .
most h@@ is@@ p@@ anic and black children are now born to un@@ married mothers .
don &apos;t just talk about it at ted . this is a nation@@ wide policy agenda i &apos;m trying to build , and as you all know , poli@@ tics are personal .
well , ti@@ bor really started the studio , called m &amp; amp ; co .
in fact , it would really , in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of these machines , have made the atten@@ dance here , chris , really quite spar@@ se .
that morning that i was sitting with kat@@ ya and lin@@ col@@ n , i looked at my son , and i realized that when my cli@@ ent , will , was his age , he &apos;d been living by himself for two years .
if you &apos;re wired to be an anthrop@@ ologist , you &apos;ll be an anthrop@@ ologist .
their parents are often il@@ liter@@ ate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the wee@@ ken@@ ds , they &apos;ll take a computer class , they &apos;ll take an english class , and learn really , really ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary things , you know , like how to type a docum@@ ent in word , or how to say really simple things in english .
living in new york city , as i do , it &apos;s almost as if , with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quar@@ ters , it &apos;s almost like life is de@@ aling you extra hands out of that de@@ ck .
we can also connect with people based on our very specific interest@@ s .
he goes , &quot; no , sir . i own the hotel . &quot;
she lived to a hundred , even then . all along it was the sa@@ dness , the squ@@ al@@ or , but i never , until now loved her again .
and after second world war , united states is richer than u.@@ k .
here , cra@@ ig is working the head .
so now , how is that ?
a fall here , if you weren &apos;t rop@@ ed in , would be 5,000 feet down .
evolution did not pre@@ p@@ are us for this . we just don &apos;t have the band@@ wid@@ th , and for people who say , oh , they &apos;re having a nice day , they &apos;re perfectly fine , they &apos;re more in@@ sane than the rest of us .
and the second is a design issue , and it &apos;s not directly relev@@ ant , but it &apos;s a nice statement .
it &apos;s as if he &apos;s obli@@ vi@@ ous to what &apos;s going on that day .
well , first , you need energy , but not too much .
it really is .
within the sphere of people who have that view , and it &apos;s a large number of people in the musli@@ m world who dis@@ agree with bin laden in his appli@@ cation , but agree that islam is the answer .
you want a little more ras@@ p@@ berry , a little more cho@@ col@@ ate here or there ?
you can trans@@ mit power , but the band@@ wid@@ th is in those tiny , little thre@@ ads smaller than the hair on your head in diam@@ e@@ ter .
what i want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds , digital glob@@ es , the 3-@@ d web , the me@@ ta@@ verse .
i think im@@ pres@@ sions have an in@@ sane effect on what we think and what we do .
audience : 3@@ 2@@ 1 .
show everybody what you in@@ tend . &quot;
when i was secre@@ tary of state , there were only 13 other women foreign mini@@ sters .
and i came back , and i wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly , so i decided to turn around in this big street that inter@@ se@@ cted our neighbor@@ hood , and wh@@ am ! i was hit by a pass@@ ing se@@ dan .
it has taken me , this journey , to islam@@ ab@@ ad , where i have wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed and met women with their faces mel@@ ted off .
but i -- they didn &apos;t let me do it , so i just -- you know , they would only let me do other things .
but all i learned about wor@@ k-@@ life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn &apos;t have any work .
the next one , many of you know .
now , here is a horse that was de@@ ath@@ ly afraid of black co@@ w@@ boy hat@@ s .
it &apos;s a rather medi@@ oc@@ re looking drag@@ on@@ fly .
and that &apos;s how he really mar@@ ks his terri@@ tory .
and this is true across sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , actually .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
once it stabili@@ zes that , it li@@ f@@ ts a foot , and then with the win@@ ch it can clim@@ b up these kinds of thing .
and i &apos;m going to show you three cli@@ ps , because i tag@@ ged 1,@@ 100 tun@@ as .
the system is highly run by accoun@@ tan@@ ts ; there &apos;s not enough , or any , fo@@ o@@ d-@@ knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able people in the business .
what a mess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
she does it with only one a@@ ge-@@ old gest@@ ure .
they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
hiv exists all over the world .
the cancer was too advan@@ ced .
on the neuro@@ logi@@ cal causes of dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ia in children that i en@@ counter@@ ed a star@@ t@@ ling fact that i &apos;d like to share with you all today .
they &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently quali@@ fied to make fl@@ at screen t@@ v@@ s .
among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an original than a for@@ gery because there &apos;s always going to be fewer origin@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies .
i won a full acade@@ mic sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship out of high school .
and when i say desk@@ top , i don &apos;t just mean the actual des@@ k where his mouse has wor@@ n away the surface of the des@@ k .
and you &apos;re going to the mountains to sk@@ i , you get different ac@@ cess@@ ories put on the car for doing that sort of thing .
real no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates hand you the prize .
now , again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities .
it &apos;s caused a lot of contro@@ vers@@ y because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man , one mo@@ dem democracy , where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .
it was able -- but only it was able -- to organi@@ ze health care , education , poli@@ cing , justice .
in the case of the ga@@ stri@@ c broo@@ ding fro@@ g , we may have &quot; fun@@ gi@@ ci@@ ded &quot; it to death .
these technologies , combined with the extraordinary tal@@ ents of teachers , provide an opportunity to revolu@@ tioni@@ ze education .
now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now .
and we can use this system to test di@@ et@@ ary factors at concent@@ ra@@ tions that are ob@@ tain@@ able by eating .
&quot; huhu@@ huhu@@ huhu@@ hu@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha . &quot;
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 p@@ m in rio .
so , it &apos;s kind of like very fan@@ cy e@@ ye@@ gl@@ asses for your telescope .
&quot; push it further . &quot;
and you might like to hear some of the principles that i &apos;ve developed in doing that teaching and coun@@ sel@@ ing .
of course they did .
and what does he see but a bur@@ g@@ lar with a gu@@ n in his hand .
so , again , this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to cat@@ ch on .
that is , if we don &apos;t take action and do something , these pla@@ ins will be completely de@@ vo@@ id of big cats , and then , in turn , everything else will dis@@ appear .
now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
and the third night , he would give it two more fol@@ ds -- and this is a very , very famous cap .
and if you &apos;re starting a design fir@@ m , let &apos;s say , then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security .
continu@@ ing here in the studio with our gu@@ est michael o &apos;@@ don@@ o@@ hu@@ e , head of com@@ modi@@ ties at four contin@@ ents capital management .
so i decided to go there and act as a s@@ eller .
are they going to start having children right away ?
so , there &apos;s still work to be done .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
because i &apos;ll show you where there might be a few gli@@ t@@ ches in evolution . okay , let me just explain this to you .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
so i spent three months in kenya , uganda and tanz@@ ania intervie@@ wing entrepreneur@@ s that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
but i would go in on oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on .
and i brought an example with me of that today .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
you can &apos;t sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you don &apos;t know who they are .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
year after year after year , absolutely incredible .
the color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the proje@@ ction , or light from the proje@@ ction , makes the colors look so impossible .
and the world bank has ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged this and they &apos;ve started a project called waves -- wealth accoun@@ ting and valu@@ ation of ecosystem services .
and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves .
in fact , it &apos;s going to require twice the world &apos;s supply of oil to run the pump@@ s to generate the water .
thank you .
he said it &apos;s not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .
instead , they had 1@@ 10 , and they were completely shocked .
and he gave an inter@@ view in dec@@ ember .
so using my arch@@ -@@ ne@@ mes@@ is , span@@ ish , no less , to learn tan@@ go .
we had about 80 people show up to partici@@ pate , ent@@ ering one-@@ b@@ y-@@ one .
well , they didn &apos;t revol@@ t , and in 19@@ 4@@ 1 , as@@ cap cra@@ cked .
we launched the breast cancer three-@@ days with an initial investment of 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars in risk capital .
and that is how ja@@ i@@ pu@@ r foot was created in india .
and even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines , the d@@ ot@@ ted line shows that even if emis@@ sions of greenhouse g@@ asses stopped today , the next decades will see ris@@ ing sea levels .
now we ration@@ ally know that an economy built on hyper@@ -@@ consumption is a pon@@ z@@ i sche@@ me . it &apos;s a house of cards .
they found themselves pre@@ gn@@ ant .
so you &apos;re here for one reason , and that reason is because you need your business competi@@ tors , ri@@ v@@ als , hat@@ ers , or whatever the reason is , or who , they are to go down .
for the last three years , i was sho@@ ot@@ ing the earth for the movie .
we teach , touch and move .
but again , there were moments , for sure , there were moments of real , hon@@ est@@ -@@ to-@@ god musi@@ cal inter@@ play , for sure .
we don &apos;t think about it a lot , and unfortunately , we actually don &apos;t even think about buildings , i think , as much as we should .
the tot@@ ality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
well , there &apos;s a long white ro@@ be in hea@@ ven , i know .
it &apos;s a daily newspaper with a de@@ ad@@ line of 4 p@@ .@@ m .
so , three and a half years ago , a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing .
and they re@@ did that building .
it &apos;s called &quot; no lo@@ o , no i do . &quot;
by the 195@@ 0s , we started conne@@ cting all the to@@ w@@ ns together with what a lot of people cla@@ im is the eigh@@ th wonder of the world , the highway system .
bill joy : what i &apos;m worried about , what i &apos;m excited about
and then i understood that asking my father so many questions was stir@@ ring up a whole past he probably didn &apos;t feel like talking about because it was pain@@ ful .
don &apos;t forget the key principles : nam@@ ing , sh@@ aming and ja@@ iling .
i mean , they &apos;re being inst@@ alled in hom@@ eless clin@@ ics -- everywhere .
anyway , you know every time i make this speech -- it &apos;s not the first time -- but it &apos;s an emo@@ tion .
but eventually , no matter how good you are at dig@@ ging up the church recor@@ ds , and all that stuff , you hit what the gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ sts call a bri@@ ck wall .
well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re standing in the middle of the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ? what do you do ? you do this .
also , they make a reason@@ able return , and they also know that first inv@@ e@@ stors in these kinds of things , they &apos;re going to have to belie@@ vers .
metaphor is not just the dete@@ ction of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
there are also , i think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born b@@ lan@@ k sl@@ ates .
what &apos;ll happen is that the st@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts will start moving through our society here , and they will ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late in the dr@@ un@@ k@@ est , st@@ in@@ gi@@ est people .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lap@@ se .
if there &apos;s a plum@@ ber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant bu@@ tt cra@@ ck . admit it .
i want to have hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ ture and green@@ houses on top of res@@ identi@@ al areas .
i &apos;ve got a group of 10 people that work with me to ga@@ ther data on key meas@@ ures of technology in many different areas , and we build models .
but my brother didn &apos;t . my brother went straight down the line .
&quot; if it works , it works , baby .
what new thing are you contribu@@ ting to our knowledge of biology ?
the self that lives in the long narra@@ tive ar@@ c and the self that experiences the moment become one .
this is sick beyond belief .
so you are not talking about low cost , you are talking about ultra@@ -@@ low cost .
this one dis@@ gu@@ ises itself as flo@@ ating al@@ ga@@ e .
wait , wait , wait -- please take any card .
and i think inspired by that memory , it &apos;s been my des@@ ire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can , sort of pass it on through whatever means .
so i &apos;m going to share with you some cover@@ ages that i feel demon@@ strate the stor@@ y@@ telling power of photo@@ graphy .
i started writing on a computer back in the 197@@ 0s when one of the first at@@ e@@ ch systems was inst@@ alled at the chicago sun@@ -@@ times .

he was the secon@@ d-@@ weal@@ thi@@ est busin@@ ess@@ man in india , and after discover@@ ing this information , the terror@@ ist war room gave the order to the terrori@@ sts on the ground in mumbai .
but what i &apos;m more concerned about in many ways is that , as we de-@@ link ourselves from nature , as we de-@@ link ourselves spiritu@@ ally from these animals , we lose hope , we lose that spiritu@@ al connection , our dignity , that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet .
the at@@ a is the first telescope built from a large number of small dis@@ hes , and ho@@ o@@ ked together with computers .
in 193@@ 9 , the radio corpor@@ ation of america introduced television .
but he came out of the ou@@ thou@@ se not up@@ set at all .
we can know the answer to this question .
and they seem an@@ xi@@ ous to sk@@ ir@@ t around it and step over it and to talk about something else .
she pointed out that the &quot; control men &quot; -- as she called them -- who car@@ pe@@ t-@@ bom@@ bed to@@ w@@ ns and fields with tox@@ ic inse@@ cti@@ ci@@ des like dd@@ t , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
it &apos;s a question of what the citizens do .
here &apos;s what a bab@@ y-@@ c@@ am video looks like .
and in that paraly@@ sis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paraly@@ zed .
this site will docum@@ ent every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . so you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
it &apos;s got light organ@@ s on its bel@@ ly that are fl@@ ash@@ ing , f@@ in lights .
jam@@ ie oli@@ ver is campaig@@ ning to save america from the way we eat .
after that first in@@ jury , their risk for second in@@ jury is exponenti@@ ally greater .
a plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs co2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutri@@ ents , which it dra@@ ws from the soil .
i came out of a blu@@ e-@@ col@@ lar town , a g@@ m town , and my father worked at g@@ m , so i was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also in@@ formed my work . but you know , to see china and the scale at which it &apos;s evol@@ ving , is quite something .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m great . i &apos;m okay . &quot;
and you can actually simu@@ late that behavior in the brow@@ ser , which is what you see ro@@ m@@ o doing on the left .
and i said , &quot; p@@ am , you &apos;re such a modern , cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge person .
so , you can say like , &quot; because i knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to hell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , i ch@@ opp@@ ed his head off . and that was the most compassi@@ onate thing i could do . &quot;
i played the cl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing te@@ ac@@ up and the s@@ lin@@ k@@ y in the main reading room of the new york public library , where you &apos;re supposed to be very , very quie@@ t , and it was a phenomen@@ ally wonderful event , which we hopefully will do some more .
and it actually was the right choice , probably , to try to make it out -- this way .
that &apos;s the weak form of the k@@ not .
and the hopeful response deri@@ ves from recogni@@ zing that islam and democracy are technologies .
and i saw him because he was an ac@@ tor , i was an ac@@ tor , i had a connection to him , because we needed to get to the press , we needed this attra@@ ction , we needed the media to be involved .
that &apos;s right -- flies , like people , have dop@@ am@@ ine , and it acts on their brains and on their syn@@ ap@@ ses through the same dop@@ am@@ ine rec@@ ep@@ tor molecules that you and i have .
chimpanze@@ es don &apos;t have a spo@@ ken language . we &apos;ve talked about that .
they &apos;re being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years , or maybe even thousands of years , are being broken up and spread across in the sub@@ urban areas outside of shanghai . but these are a whole series of guys holding out in this re@@ construction of shanghai .
so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand , so they sent me sand from all the different land@@ ings of the apollo mis@@ sions that happened 40 years ago .
so what can we do to think about bor@@ ders differently in this part of the world ?
either way they were going to eat it .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
but not only is it pain@@ ful , it kill@@ s lots of babies , it kill@@ s lots of mothers , and it &apos;s very expensive to produce .
but also it &apos;s part of being any mon@@ th@@ ly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long le@@ ad@@ -@@ time .
this is a chain gang of guys ad@@ mi@@ ring the car .
if you ask what kind of a situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people becoming friends and alli@@ es , the technical answer is a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum situation .
currently , they &apos;re using a me@@ thod of trial and er@@ ror , but this could tell you precisely what disease you have .
and in about half an hour , we got five sam@@ ples , five individual sharks , were sam@@ pl@@ ed using sim@@ on &apos;s shar@@ k sli@@ me sam@@ pl@@ ing system .
that &apos;s me and my sister , es@@ ther , who &apos;s a frequ@@ ent ted@@ ster .
and therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and p@@ at , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women .
and they were moving and gr@@ in@@ ding and moving their arms up and down each other .
i love that kind of stuff .
and from there we clim@@ b up to cam@@ p two , which is sort of the fore@@ ground .
now the problems begin first with pit@@ ch perception .
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
and in the middle of this sort of har@@ bor bath , we &apos;re actually going to put the actual little mer@@ ma@@ id .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
i broke my right arm . i broke my coll@@ arb@@ one .
and i worry sometimes that we spend so much time cele@@ br@@ ating amazing things that hard@@ ly anybody can do that we &apos;ve convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth cele@@ br@@ ating , and we start to de@@ value the things that we can do every day , and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don &apos;t let ourselves take cre@@ dit for it , and we don &apos;t let ourselves feel good about it .
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
now , the photo@@ grapher who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to see this re@@ curr@@ ing character .
so we put that out on the wire : 1,@@ 400 tu@@ tors .
she went to au@@ schwi@@ tz when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost .
uganda has just discovered oil , in about the most dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous location on earth ; ghana has discovered oil ; guinea has got a huge new explo@@ it@@ ation of ir@@ on ore coming out of the ground .
so the machine is computing .
yet , what percent@@ age of americ@@ ans do you think ever had a bom@@ b shel@@ ter in their house ?
and for the rest of us , audience members , as listen@@ ers , as rea@@ ders , we eat this stuff up .
ri@@ ck sm@@ ol@@ an : the story of a girl
these are the an@@ thers of a li@@ ly , clever@@ ly done so that when the uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting inse@@ ct lands on it , the an@@ ther fli@@ ps up and wh@@ ops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .
i mean , s@@ ant@@ a cl@@ aus knows if you &apos;re n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty or nice , right ? &quot;
is this thing off ?
on one of my first tri@@ ps to india , i met this young woman , se@@ vi@@ th@@ a , who had just given birth to a tiny pre@@ mat@@ ure baby , ran@@ i .
they have to be precisely la@@ th@@ ed .
so cut to now . we still have an energy crisis , and now we have a climate crisis as well . you know , so humans generate about 12 trillion watts , or 12 ter@@ a@@ watts , from fossi@@ l fu@@ els .
it comfort@@ ably ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es one teenager and it &apos;s shor@@ ter than a traffic c@@ one , and it &apos;s almost as efficient as a bi@@ cycle as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour .
first of all , when you go to bed at night , you &apos;ve got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contribu@@ ted something , and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could .
mia says , &quot; when my class@@ mates write a pres@@ cri@@ ption , they think their work is done .
and figure out how to do this in a way that was tru@@ th@@ ful in that it im@@ par@@ ted what was going on , but not so tru@@ th@@ ful that the comp@@ act crow@@ ding in a cell would prevent the vi@@ st@@ a from happening .
and i think this is lar@@ gel@@ y what &apos;s behind the crisis of le@@ giti@@ ma@@ cy in our different governments right now .
now i am a fir@@ m belie@@ ver in justice , i just think that it is impossible .
how do we create a big network ?
so , total re@@ ver@@ sal of trade policy .
if you take a look at these scans that we have of e@@ mi@@ ly , you can see that the human face does an enorm@@ ous amount of amazing things as it goes into different fac@@ ial expres@@ sions .
k@@ yma@@ eric@@ a with water@@ falls , tu@@ m@@ bling through our -- ed : this is one of the traditional k@@ yma@@ eri@@ can songs .
it was very important for us to get through to the people .
when you learn to read and write , it op@@ ens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things .
we are always chasing storms .
and i came to kos@@ o@@ v@@ o and ad@@ vis@@ ed the kos@@ o@@ v@@ o government .
the first pengu@@ ins to make that transition to free fee@@ ding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the apollo sea sp@@ ill six years earlier .
let &apos;s see here .
i fa@@ in@@ ted and land@@ ed on it , and it broke .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consi@@ sten@@ cy -- people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still per@@ si@@ sts -- and it has a kind of res@@ ili@@ ence that allows it to per@@ s@@ ist across time .
for the last 15 years that i have been per@@ forming , all i ever wanted to do was transc@@ end po@@ e@@ try to the world .
there are four girls a little bit older than me .
and so there are some psych@@ ological effects that happen with this .
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-@@ tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-@@ head .
and they said , &quot; ah , no problem ! we just get out and walk . &quot;
we know the limit@@ s of the resources we have .
i would like to ac@@ qui@@ re it , but without ow@@ ning it .
tom hon@@ ey : why would god create a ts@@ un@@ ami ?
like wikipedia , like the open direc@@ tory project , you &apos;re beginning to build plat@@ forms , and you see that as a model .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
girl 1 : well , i think it &apos;s important but , like , not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch program@@ s .
and , indeed , once again we &apos;re moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the gr@@ ass@@ lands of africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hun@@ ting and gather@@ ing societies today .
when you have rain in a place that has no trees , in just a few minutes , the water arri@@ ves in the stre@@ am , brings soil , destro@@ ying our water source , destro@@ ying the ri@@ vers , and no hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty to re@@ tain .
how could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
and so the next time you meet someone , a str@@ an@@ ger , one request : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
i &apos;m sorry for this .
one of them always drives the other ex@@ tin@@ ct .
second story .
abed would hu@@ g me . abed would sp@@ it at me .
we should deli@@ ver medi@@ cin@@ es to those who are ill .
the fa@@ st@@ est way out of a bad mo@@ od : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance .
there were many other things to do .
and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
most people say women .
well , the bad news is that these robust -- and robust is a key word -- emer@@ gent systems are very hard to understand in detail .
this is in 1960 .
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years , and he &apos;s lo@@ yal to the property because of the relationship that vivi@@ an and her fellow employees have created with him .
i gradu@@ ated .
i ri@@ de with these kids once a week , every tu@@ es@@ day .
so i had this sin on my sou@@ l when i went to my first conf@@ ession .
right now , it feels like i for@@ got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gray and it seems like the world is spinn@@ ing while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am spinn@@ ing i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe now everybody s@@ ings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe thank you .
so the different tricks that mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u &#91; ri@@ card &#93; and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emo@@ tion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks , getting more of it .
we signed with a major lab@@ el .
and this is the world that we lived in .
anyway , that piece also has a kin@@ e@@ tic sculp@@ ture in the middle of it , and i dance around a small stage so -- two minutes , just to end ? the lat@@ est piece that i &apos;m working on -- what i love is that i never know what i &apos;m working on , why i &apos;m working on it .
so the notion , you change the soil , the se@@ ed doesn &apos;t grow as well .
eigh@@ ty-@@ five percent is a really big number .
and so this is fram@@ ing -- l@@ um@@ ber , comp@@ os@@ ite materials -- and it &apos;s kind of hard to get the em@@ bo@@ died energy out of that , but it can be a sustainable resource if you use f@@ sc@@ -@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied l@@ um@@ ber .
what is it that governments and n@@ gos can learn from co@@ ke ?
and you should know that basically 99 , probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed .
you know , like even , i mean i love like the name , the -- ted .
here &apos;s another example , which i put up because it &apos;s an example of really important current science .
so at this point , she deci@@ des to put the r@@ ape book away .
i just break off another bott@@ len@@ eck and play these steel guit@@ ar blu@@ es .
trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this .
we can just send a message and hope for the best .
yes we can . we can do it .
there &apos;s not a stra@@ w@@ berry tree or a car@@ rot bush .
surgery , che@@ mo@@ therap@@ y and radi@@ ation are the be@@ st-@@ known metho@@ ds for treating cancer . at ted@@ med , bill do@@ yle pres@@ ents a new approach , called tumor treating fields , which uses electric fields to inter@@ rupt cancer cell di@@ vision . still in its in@@ fan@@ cy -- and appro@@ ved for only certain types of cancer -- the treatment comes with one big benefit : quality of life .
that &apos;s all i wanted -- just two practic@@ es .
all these tra@@ its you can find in young kids , and you can help nur@@ ture them .
and so we &apos;re in a sk@@ ull , and we &apos;re moving really , really quickly .
i mean , this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade .
the garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be tor@@ n down , finally , and several small class@@ rooms will be placed along this a@@ venue that we &apos;ve created , this cam@@ pu@@ s .
we now live in a global village where we can mi@@ mic the ties that used to happen face to face , but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before .
there &apos;s one other kind of new venue , the private mp@@ 3 player .
we have a way of add@@ res@@ sing that , a new way of add@@ res@@ sing that .
i probably made a lot of mista@@ kes when i did it that no one ever discovered , so data quality goes down .
so , m@@ aps of things le@@ ading to organized under@@ stand@@ ings of the universe in which we emer@@ ge .
so explor@@ ation can pay for itself .
is@@ ab@@ el all@@ ende : tal@@ es of passion
now , according to pro@@ pon@@ ents of the cl@@ ash of civili@@ zations , bar@@ b@@ ie and ful@@ la occu@@ p@@ y these completely separate sp@@ her@@ es .
you don &apos;t have to sleep with prostit@@ utes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized cri@@ me .
what i really think we ga@@ in from this is students getting intui@@ tion and experience in far greater quanti@@ ties than they &apos;ve ever got before .
so je@@ an@@ ny and i took three of our most efficient stra@@ ins and then per@@ formed gene amp@@ li@@ fication sequen@@ cing on them and mat@@ ched our data with an online comprehen@@ sive dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and that , when they sit on those street cor@@ ners and all they can think of in the future is no job , no education , no possibility , well then it &apos;s easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uni@@ form and a gu@@ n .
also , tho@@ u s@@ halt not dis@@ reg@@ ard the ir@@ rational .
let us all meet in that field .
it gets up to about 150 feet long .
em : there actually are far more char@@ ging sta@@ tions than people realize , and at tes@@ la we developed something called a super@@ char@@ ging technology , and we &apos;re off@@ ering that if you buy a model s for free , for@@ ever .
and then once that c@@ able was on sh@@ ore , they began to pre@@ p@@ are to connect it to the other side , for the c@@ able that had been brought down from the land@@ ing station .
dh : i think so , that &apos;s right .
we tended towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
and we wat@@ ched and stayed with john do@@ oli@@ ka@@ hn .
how can we interven@@ e in the life of a mur@@ derer before he &apos;s a mur@@ derer ?
now mind you , three days earlier , we had 60 pengu@@ ins under our care , so we were defin@@ it@@ ely over@@ wh@@ el@@ med and just a bit terri@@ fied -- at least i was .
sure , we invest pl@@ enty in innovation . we invest in broad@@ band and science education and science gr@@ ants , but we invest far too little in rein@@ vent@@ ing and re@@ designing the institutions that we have .
and around that time , i met john gar@@ d@@ ner , who is a remarkable man .
love and peace were mentioned , kind of with quote mar@@ ks around them , right ?
and you can see my map if i get it up here . you know ?
they are going to re@@ ce@@ de towards the van@@ ishing point in the hori@@ zon , and i want you to notice two things .
we couldn &apos;t survive for an inst@@ ant in it . language brea@@ ks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those je@@ ts .
and the par@@ all@@ els between the events of 5@@ 3@@ 9 b@@ c and 200@@ 3 and in between are star@@ t@@ ling .
they in@@ spe@@ ct it , they check it for cra@@ cks , for dri@@ ll damage , for sp@@ alls , for chi@@ ps .
as we heard from dr. insel this morning , psychiat@@ ric dis@@ orders like autis@@ m , depression and schizophren@@ ia take a terrible toll on human suffering .
but this our con@@ tainment of the visible universe .
please , become am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors .
and shor@@ tly after the election and the outbreak of violence , the government suddenly im@@ posed a significant media black@@ out .
but if you send a mining team there , without the return pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ant , first -- did any of you guys hear the story of cor@@ te@@ z ?
and i was call@@ ing about how to make a@@ ji@@ ac@@ o . it &apos;s a cu@@ ban me@@ al .
where the percent@@ age of il@@ liter@@ acy is very high , we use puppe@@ try .
the second path is eu@@ da@@ im@@ oni@@ an flow .
and so far there are only three major sour@@ ces of that -- coal and gas , hydro@@ -@@ electric , which in most places is max@@ e@@ d-@@ out -- and nuclear .
we &apos;re at the long tail end here .
these are five kil@@ ot@@ on yiel@@ d bom@@ bs about the size of small volks@@ wa@@ gens ; it would take 800 to get into or@@ bit .
they wired them for ligh@@ ting . so your -- your appli@@ an@@ ces would plu@@ g in .
it re@@ minds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot;
and there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
well , as a cambridge professor , i had many con@@ tac@@ ts .
collabor@@ ator six : watching the video in my room , i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
you need training . i &apos;ll help you .
the average price of a human being today , around the world , is about 90 dollars .
it &apos;s from a study we did into il@@ liter@@ acy , and it &apos;s a guy in a te@@ as@@ ho@@ p .
and so i said , &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot;
there &apos;s a tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a ju@@ ven@@ ile .
and we have taken pictures like this .
in other words , the pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a l@@ ack of control .
so i &apos;m going to leave that over there because i have a question for paul .
think of it as a massive it@@ un@@ es for book type content .
and what he said was : treat your ene@@ mi@@ es as if they were pre@@ cious je@@ wel@@ s , because it &apos;s your ene@@ mi@@ es that build your toler@@ ance and pati@@ ence on the road to your en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
have you seen me touch the computer ?
there &apos;s a buil@@ t-@@ in oxygen concent@@ r@@ ator down there .
mon@@ tage causes all of the feelings that con@@ tain photograph@@ s to become extra@@ cted and display themselves in a grid .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combin@@ ation of factors .
pi@@ p from &quot; great expec@@ tations &quot; was adop@@ ted ; super@@ man was a fo@@ ster child ; cin@@ der@@ ell@@ a was a fo@@ ster child ; li@@ s@@ be@@ th sal@@ ander , the girl with the drag@@ on tat@@ too , was fo@@ ster@@ ed and institu@@ tion@@ alized ; bat@@ man was or@@ phan@@ ed ; l@@ yr@@ a bel@@ ac@@ qu@@ a from phili@@ p pul@@ l@@ man &apos;s &quot; northern lights &quot; was fo@@ ster@@ ed ; jan@@ e ey@@ re , adop@@ ted ; ro@@ ald da@@ hl &apos;s james from &quot; james and the giant pe@@ ach ; &quot; ma@@ til@@ da ; mos@@ es -- mos@@ es !
first of all , we have all the statisti@@ cal analy@@ ses from the inno@@ c@@ ence project work , where we know that we have , what , 250 , 2@@ 80 docum@@ ented cases now where people have been wr@@ ong@@ fully con@@ vi@@ cted and sub@@ sequ@@ ently ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated , some from death row , on the basis of later dna analysis , and you know that over three quar@@ ters of all of those cases of ex@@ on@@ er@@ ation involved only e@@ ye@@ wit@@ ness identi@@ fication te@@ stim@@ ony during the trial that con@@ vi@@ cted them .
certain sorts of college .
but here &apos;s a scary one : di@@ vor@@ ce is con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous .
at the end , there will only be one mar@@ ker left standing and it will determine our wealth in reti@@ rement .
but there &apos;s also the fear of los@@ ing loved ones , and i think that &apos;s even worse .
and i kind of ru@@ min@@ ated on that for a couple of days .
this is a newspaper publi@@ sh@@ er and a ban@@ ker .
it &apos;s like i gave you a new car and you &apos;re complaining about not finding par@@ king .
you then have some body part descri@@ p@@ tions : &quot; it &apos;s in the li@@ ver , in the breast , in the prostate . &quot;
if you think you &apos;ve got an estimate for how many dig@@ its , right -- we &apos;ve already got one competi@@ tor here .
so the bal@@ lo@@ on is being filled up with hel@@ ium on the le@@ ft-@@ hand side , and the fab@@ ric actually r@@ uns all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electronics and explosi@@ ves being connected to a par@@ ach@@ ute , and then the par@@ ach@@ ute is then connected to the pay@@ load .
now here &apos;s a closer view of that community .
this building , when an arti@@ stic director wanted to do a &quot; cher@@ ry or@@ ch@@ ard &quot; and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage , they brought a back@@ ho@@ e in , and they simply du@@ g the hole .
but one time i was in o@@ a@@ kl@@ and walking along broad@@ way , and came to a corner .
this got me thinking .
the other two are dr. ts@@ un@@ em@@ i ku@@ bo@@ der@@ a and dr. steve o &apos;@@ she@@ a .
richard se@@ ymour : how beauty feels
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
the other picture is the pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of the real need for change .
to come back to the oil problem , oil is something we can replace .
ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election st@@ alled in the 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tions -- bush versus gore .
so they would cat@@ ch parts of the images , and make sort of three-@@ dimensional color vol@@ um@@ es , as you walk through it , through the object .
it &apos;s like mush@@ rooms coming through con@@ cre@@ te .
no@@ ah wil@@ son@@ -@@ rich : every city needs healthy hon@@ ey be@@ es
as an ir@@ ish@@ man , he hat@@ ed the english so much he didn &apos;t have much emo@@ tion for anyone else .
i think it will be great .
they fl@@ ash up into my memory , just like google for pictures .
imagine your last hamburger .
the ty@@ pe@@ face -- the ty@@ pe@@ face is hel@@ ve@@ tica ; it &apos;s its 5@@ 0@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary this year .
so that &apos;s a wish i &apos;m thro@@ wing out here for everybody , and i hope i can really engage you in this idea .
which is why in this vast and lon@@ ely cos@@ mos , we are so wonder@@ fully optimi@@ stic .
and those are the pieces of wood . those are the in@@ struc@@ tions .
so prote@@ i is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shap@@ e-@@ shif@@ ting h@@ ull .
started doing this , we would have to re@@ design the entire intelligence system from the ground up .
so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather play@@ ful attemp@@ t to try to anno@@ y fru@@ it flies might actually have some relev@@ ance to a human psychiat@@ ric dis@@ order .
it &apos;s in our g@@ all@@ eri@@ es that we can un@@ pack the civili@@ zations , the cultures , that we &apos;re seeing the current mani@@ fest@@ ation of .
and also , if you &apos;re embedded in such a network of relationships , your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of rela@@ tions .
i remember what you said to me .
k first time , a r@@ ally and a street play in a r@@ ural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why liter@@ acy is important .
and no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
am : well , for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bi@@ o -- it might have given it away -- i &apos;m a double am@@ pu@@ tee , and i was born without fi@@ bu@@ las in both legs .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
so that &apos;s my story . to be continued .
and everybody says , well don &apos;t they adv@@ ance in the winter time ?
four years ago , 23 african countries came together to create the great green wall sahar@@ a .
it &apos;s up there .
now these are not election re@@ turns , these are the people -- the number of the people who are ob@@ ese by state , beginning in &apos; 85 , &apos; 8@@ 6 , &apos; 8@@ 7 -- these are from the c@@ d@@ c website -- &apos; 8@@ 8 , &apos; 89 , &apos; 90 , &apos; 9@@ 1 -- you get a new categ@@ ory -- &apos; 9@@ 2 , &apos; 9@@ 3 , &apos; 9@@ 4 , &apos; 95 , &apos; 96 , &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , &apos; 99 , 2000 , 200@@ 1 -- it gets worse . we &apos;re kind of de@@ vol@@ ving .
&quot; well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? &quot;
this mush@@ room exists in sym@@ bios@@ is with the roots .
now i should say , before that , what i did is i po@@ sted a condu@@ ctor track of myself condu@@ cting .
and what we saw was , we saw these variations , and then they told us the secre@@ ts , both about the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time , and about the cont@@ ents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original mo@@ tions .
and who am i ki@@ dding when i say almost ?
if their eyes are sh@@ ining , you know you &apos;re doing it .
you understand &quot; for@@ ged cur@@ ren@@ cy , &quot; &quot; for@@ ged pictures . &quot;
so that is a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic .
we take the cells , we expand them , we place the cells on the sc@@ aff@@ old , and we then place the sc@@ aff@@ old back into the patient .
he called it , &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ resol@@ ution . &quot;
i &apos;ve even spo@@ ken to people , like peter car@@ ter here , who when i spo@@ ke to him was 90 years old , but in 19@@ 26 , this man and his father and his brother caught thy@@ l@@ ac@@ ines . they tr@@ apped them .
they &apos;re 11 and 12 .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to vis@@ ually nar@@ rate a story .
tell the ir@@ ani@@ ans we from israel love you too . &quot;
the universe is really big .
i wanted to go home . i was driving .
it &apos;s a long story , believe me .
i remember we cri@@ ed prof@@ us@@ ely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
and basically we took ha@@ y and cra@@ b ap@@ ples and made bar@@ bec@@ ue sau@@ ce out of those two ingredients .
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
and a few friends of mine and i decided this doesn &apos;t make sense .
and growing up as we have , and holding very high the value of free speech , this is a hard thing for us to acc@@ ept -- for all of us to acc@@ ept .
most of the children there have parents who are il@@ liter@@ ate .
these are my friends . oh my g@@ os@@ h , they &apos;re such good people .
you can create one out of le@@ gos .
and i &apos;d like to believe that the privi@@ lege fi@@ red within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure , that i &apos;ve tried to bring to each of my books since then .
if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the charac@@ ters , we can go into this hidden hall@@ way , and i &apos;ll quickly just show you the interface .
you know , we say , half the world is living in cities .
and this individual himself , this one that i &apos;m holding up here , actually had a bad back . he &apos;d probably had an in@@ jury as a child .
here &apos;s a more top@@ ical example of exactly the same thing .
some of them ele@@ ct not to save .
let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
but then we are also so fortunate to wit@@ ness the transformation of the whole country .
we would signific@@ antly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
it &apos;s an expression of beauty . it &apos;s how they say they love you .
and when the average person looks at a co@@ bra going &quot; ss@@ ss@@ s@@ s ! &quot; like that , they say , &quot; my god , look at that angry , dangerous cre@@ ature . &quot;
the history of our world is these decisions .
and actually , we &apos;ve had about 1@@ 5,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to fla@@ vor , new ways to co@@ ok and to change tex@@ ture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
we also , not co@@ inci@@ dent@@ ally , went through an era of tremendous social and political in@@ ven@@ tions .
now , there &apos;s one way to interpre@@ t this , which is to say that &quot; e@@ man@@ cip@@ ation &quot; and &quot; depression &quot; and &quot; re@@ covery &quot; all have a lot of sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les .
it &apos;s very bus@@ y . same principles : one-@@ on-@@ one attention , complete de@@ vo@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a bo@@ und@@ less opti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
your cat wants more food .
and second of all , it requ@@ ires imagination .
so , sensors are looking at that kind of voice .
the vision statement of wikipedia is very simple : a world in which every human being can fre@@ ely share in the sum of all knowledge .
and as you pass by it &apos;s always part -- you see it as all of these pieces acc@@ ru@@ e and become part of an over@@ all neighbor@@ hood .
it &apos;s that little green sli@@ ver on the hori@@ zon , which makes them very nervous about ris@@ ing oceans .
it used to be a weight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors below , ac@@ ou@@ stic tile c@@ ei@@ l@@ ings and flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent lights .
he said , &quot; one feels in@@ cl@@ ined to say that the inten@@ tion that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation . &quot;
and i wanted to figure out how i could take the bl@@ ess@@ ing of these resources and share it with the world .
it &apos;s so that the bloo@@ ds and the cri@@ ps will know which side to vote for .
attention is a powerful thing .
so one of my assi@@ stan@@ ts , who never went to school , said to me , &quot; listen , zer@@ ay .
it is no longer the case .
it &apos;s two fan@@ s , one which he could turn from outside after he got the v@@ acu@@ um establi@@ shed , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
i think before i did the &quot; vagina mon@@ olo@@ gues &quot; i didn &apos;t really believe in happiness .
and i had no idea where i was going . i had no idea .
and then we decided to help people out of poverty , now that we got aids some@@ what out of the way -- this time , not with government alone , but in co@@ operation with the business community .
and when we die , we don &apos;t even have to be placed in different re@@ f@@ use s@@ ac@@ s .
in an irri@@ t@@ ated voice , they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in english , so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it . &quot;
com@@ modi@@ ty pri@@ ces are like this .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance whe@@ els .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an oper@@ ator .
and this , in terms of mag@@ n@@ es@@ ium and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equ@@ ates to a $ 4@@ .@@ 5 billion mining industry for sing@@ ap@@ ore -- a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
this is a completely gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous video i &apos;m just going to show of one of the pit@@ falls of advan@@ ced technology .
now my own speci@@ ality is combin@@ ing digital technology and magic .
the question we had is how could they do anything at all ?
the disease was so terri@@ fying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
ti@@ mo@@ thy pre@@ ster@@ o thought he &apos;d designed the perfect in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or for new@@ bor@@ ns in the developing world -- but his team learned a hard less@@ on when it failed to go into production . a mani@@ fest@@ o on the importance of designing for re@@ al-@@ world use , rather than ac@@ col@@ a@@ des .
it now makes sense to go back in , build a de@@ ck and build up on those sites .
every col@@ ored be@@ ad , every col@@ ored str@@ ing , represents a weather element .
and then , what &apos;s next ?
they listen to the spi@@ ri@@ ts like this -- i &apos;m going to ask you to call up the gh@@ ost of my grandmother because , when she died , she had the family will , and she secre@@ ted it some@@ place . we don &apos;t know where it is , so we ask gran@@ ny , &quot; where is the will , gran@@ ny ? &quot;
who gets to use the mos@@ que on fri@@ days ? &quot;
it &apos;s a &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; kind of thing .
we &apos;ve got edi@@ ble can@@ al to@@ w@@ pa@@ ths , and we &apos;ve got spr@@ ou@@ ting ce@@ me@@ ter@@ ies .
and i &apos;m also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quo@@ ti@@ di@@ an experience of time and to start to consider a deeper ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale .
it &apos;s a brilliant re@@ design of traditional religious the@@ mes -- up@@ dat@@ ing them , quie@@ tly dro@@ pping ob@@ so@@ le@@ te fe@@ atures , putting new interpre@@ tations on other fe@@ atures .
and the shape fit perfectly .
that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe . the interesting thing is , these games require that you have a lot of cognitive appar@@ at@@ us on line .
th@@ us , even though every civili@@ an killed , ma@@ im@@ ed , rap@@ ed , or tor@@ tured is one too many , the fact that the number of civili@@ an cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
in fact , they have h@@ ack@@ ers writing them .
and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and -- in fact , more fundament@@ ally than that -- ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways .
in this case -- the map of the world at night by nasa -- they &apos;re dark literally because of l@@ ack of electricity .
so , from that foun@@ tain i built this building .
they &apos;re much more than we &apos;d origin@@ ally imag@@ ined when we put together the little , initial website that we started off with .
you have to re@@ think , what is the university for ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s sp@@ am .
and i feel now like george bush .
at first they &apos;re a little fre@@ ak@@ ed out .
when you &apos;re typ@@ ing on your black@@ berry , andro@@ id , iphone , don &apos;t bo@@ ther swit@@ ching la@@ you@@ ts to the pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ation la@@ y@@ out to hit the period and then a space and then try to cap@@ itali@@ ze the next letter .
su@@ e sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh : can you play a gro@@ om@@ ing song ?
and bal@@ in@@ ese car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers like this measu@@ red them with their bam@@ bo@@ o rul@@ ers , selec@@ ted the bam@@ bo@@ o and built the buildings using a@@ ge-@@ old techniques , mostly by hand .
but with africa , let &apos;s start being care@@ ful about this .
some of you in this middle section -- you have red / green p@@ add@@ les .
and of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for gran@@ ted .
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past , new forms of co@@ operation enab@@ led by new technologies create new forms of wealth , we may be moving into yet another economic form that is signific@@ antly different from previous ones .
global warming fun .
when did we origin@@ ate as a species ?
and it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
and the second great thing about conser@@ va@@ tives : they get ec@@ ology .
it was a paraly@@ zed phan@@ tom arm .
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
now i &apos;m not trying to th@@ row st@@ ones here .
when you l@@ end them money , and they slowly pay you back over time , you have this exc@@ use to have an on@@ going di@@ alo@@ gue .
dr@@ y@@ bath is a rich man &apos;s conveni@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
and i think what dis@@ gu@@ sts me more than anything , looking back , is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so ti@@ ed up with this business thing ?
because if these companies dem@@ and sustainable products , they &apos;ll pull 40 to 50 percent of production .
and it was an expensive job , but actually it wouldn &apos;t be as much as you think because these people , they didn &apos;t come from money , they came from archi@@ medes .
and what pattern do you see here ?
and you see , it stops growing .
so , i run over to gene , and i wake him up , and i say , &quot; gene , don &apos;t fre@@ ak out , i think the hotel &apos;s on fire . &quot;
the trees can put their roots into it .
perhaps like this .
we are creating the next generation of m@@ .@@ d@@ . &apos; s and engineers capable of trans@@ l@@ ating discover@@ ies all the way from ben@@ ch to bed@@ side .
so pau@@ la rad@@ cli@@ ffe , unfortunately , does it .
and , unlike lots of cho@@ col@@ ate , lots of s@@ mil@@ ing can actually make you health@@ ier .
it &apos;s really quite sil@@ ly , isn &apos;t it ?
or he was what he cla@@ im@@ ed to be .
in fact , they seem to be very un@@ musi@@ cal entirely and to miss the whole point of the music .
in google , expres@@ sions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern .
you see it already . immediately you go in , the refle@@ ctive symmetry in the water .
thank you very much .
wow .
studies show that sk@@ et@@ ching and dood@@ ling improve our comprehen@@ sion -- and our creative thinking . so why do we still feel embar@@ rass@@ ed when we &apos;re caught dood@@ ling in a meeting ? sun@@ n@@ i brown says : dood@@ lers , uni@@ te ! she makes the case for un@@ lo@@ cking your brain via pad and pen .
what would it be like to meet fre@@ deri@@ ck dou@@ glass ? &quot;
but i also think of peter zu@@ m@@ th@@ or &apos;s sp@@ a in v@@ als , where light and dark , in very gent@@ le combin@@ ations , alter each other to defin@@ e the space .
and then the secre@@ tary general of the united nations &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
you have to create internal partners . you have to access co@@ ali@@ tion partners .
and we &apos;ve introduced a pro@@ gr@@ ession dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by eng@@ aging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually un@@ lock re@@ wards .
as i did , so sli@@ d the cha@@ ir .
50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lec@@ tures .
and so dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating that information to around the rest of africa is important .
because what i used to do , when i thought i was listening , was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could -- i knew what they were going to say , and so i stopped listening .
what the squ@@ id has developed is a sh@@ ut@@ ter that can open and close over this speci@@ alized light organ hous@@ ing the bacteria .
you know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
this is what i call shared value : add@@ res@@ sing a social issue with a business model .
the arab@@ ic word &quot; islam &quot; means &quot; sub@@ mission . &quot;
well , in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .
for example , the el@@ ev@@ ators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
this is his hand@@ writing on the morning of the treatment before going into the m@@ r so now i &apos;ll take you through &#91; what &#93; a typical proce@@ dur@@ e like that looks like , &#91; what &#93; non@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve surgery looks like .
so that &apos;s getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
we use le@@ vers all the time , in tools , do@@ or@@ kno@@ bs , bi@@ cycle parts .
now these traffic fig@@ ures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but i would say that the most surprising slide here i &apos;m going to show you today is not this one . it &apos;s this one .
on the left are one or more portra@@ it panels in which i systema@@ tically order the members of a given bloo@@ d@@ line .
so me talking about emo@@ tion is like g@@ and@@ hi talking about gl@@ u@@ tt@@ ony , but it is the central organi@@ zing process of the way we think .
well , the wind is in@@ ani@@ mate ; the dangerous predat@@ or is an inten@@ tional ag@@ ent .
and what i was hop@@ ing for is that it just mel@@ ts in front of you .
they make use of exactly the same win@@ ds .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
a project that we &apos;ve been working on very recently is to design a new biom@@ ass power station -- so a power station that uses organic waste material .
but today we &apos;re going to talk about three of these non-@@ visual user inter@@ faces .
their avail@@ ability for work can be such that it &apos;s , &quot; a few hours today .
it &apos;s more like that .
and i knew a little economics by then -- it says adam s@@ mit@@ h taught us that speci@@ alization lea@@ ds to productivity .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonom@@ ous car , that autonom@@ ous car should be at least as good as the very best human dri@@ vers .
eight , nine , 10 .
here was the mall in its he@@ y@@ day .
then they often hear that they &apos;ll need it in an up@@ coming math class or on a future test .
but today , ul@@ tr@@ ali@@ ght , ultra@@ strong materials , like carbon fi@@ ber comp@@ os@@ ites , can make drama@@ tic weight sa@@ vings s@@ no@@ w@@ ball and can make cars sim@@ pl@@ er and che@@ aper to build .
but there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird unless you fly .
but i think it &apos;s also a perfectly val@@ id way to spend an after@@ noon free@@ zing in place with 200 people in the grand central ter@@ min@@ al or dres@@ sing up like a g@@ ho@@ st@@ bu@@ ster and running through the new york public library .
in contr@@ ast , we have general t@@ so &apos;s chicken , which actually started in new york city in the early 197@@ 0s , as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early 197@@ 0s , so ...
if you want a more positive model -- this is the g@@ m car .
sw : there you go . and what do pir@@ ates like to drin@@ k ?
and the name came out jack . i &apos;m like , &quot; woo@@ o@@ o !
the tan@@ an@@ ger on the east co@@ ast of the united states , where the forests are a little den@@ ser , has one kind of call , and the tan@@ an@@ ger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call .
a number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they &apos;re making a choice , they make poor@@ er decisions , whether it be health care , investment , other critical areas .
but i have to get serious . and how do you get serious ?
well , a good answer is , &quot; it depen@@ ds . what is it ? &quot;
google has started to digiti@@ ze 15 million books .
and what we show here is -- like , here -- very few people are affected , more and more and more and up to here , and here &apos;s the pe@@ ak of the epide@@ mic .
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand , making mountains and seas -- well , not seas , but different things -- people and dogs , etc .
the way to break down the si@@ los is to get inter@@ -@@ oper@@ ability between social net@@ working sites .
they cross , but ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an , a tele@@ gen@@ ic president , is in office .
i don &apos;t know whether the idea of one computer , one child makes any sense . here &apos;s the computer of the future , because this screen is already there and they &apos;re ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
and people in chur@@ ches all over and mos@@ ques all over this contin@@ ent after september the 11@@ th , coming together lo@@ cally to create networks of understanding .
collabor@@ ator two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , brea@@ thing memor@@ ial .
and then we looked at the brain activity .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fra@@ gi@@ le than other societies ? the problem is obviously relev@@ ant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collap@@ sed , such as somalia and r@@ wand@@ a and the former y@@ ug@@ os@@ la@@ via . there are also societies today that may be close to collap@@ se , such as ne@@ pal , indones@@ ia and col@@ um@@ bia .
it seemed we couldn &apos;t turn off the production of ni@@ tri@@ c oxi@@ de in the skin of humans .
and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fer@@ tile , particularly when you cut down trees , and you leave the soil open to the wind for er@@ osi@@ on , as des@@ per@@ ate popu@@ lations cut down more and more trees , so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families , what &apos;s going to happen ? something &apos;s got to give .
back in the u.s. , there &apos;s a couple plants of similar age .
in fact , even if produ@@ cing co2 was good for the environment , given that we &apos;re going to run out of hydro@@ carb@@ ons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
why don &apos;t we lower government spending and lower government tax@@ es , and then we &apos;ll be on an even more favor@@ able long-term de@@ fic@@ it tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory ?
that &apos;s a significant number of us .
ma@@ yo@@ r blo@@ om@@ berg came in office , he was very suppor@@ tive , but we still had to make the economic case .
and this person was very for@@ ce@@ ful and said , &quot; look . that &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll ever do it . &quot;
boy : look man , reading don &apos;t feed no one .
there &apos;s something weird happening .
we know this in india . it &apos;s called a &#91; hin@@ di &#93; .
just trying to play the od@@ ds . all right , here we go .
that famous sc@@ ene in hor@@ ror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see , and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all , and i spe@@ cu@@ late that de@@ af audi@@ ences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audi@@ ences .
one of the russi@@ an scientists wrote at the time : &quot; we are about to create a new planet that we will call sputnik .
u@@ h , no . &quot;
so with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my no@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 34 cell phone -- i didn &apos;t have a laptop , i didn &apos;t have internet much , except for the 20-@@ rand@@ -@@ an@@ -@@ hour internet c@@ af@@ e — i did research on wikipedia , on google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ ams , the comp@@ osi@@ tions , the mel@@ ting points , the to@@ xi@@ cities -- i did high school science -- and i wrote down a little formul@@ a on a piece of paper , and it looked like the k@@ f@@ c special spi@@ ce , you know ?
there &apos;s one in the sk@@ ull , and then just for good measure , i had these other tumor@@ s -- including , by the time my treatment started , one was growing out of my ton@@ gue .
if version 10 is coming out next week , there &apos;s no point in ad@@ ding more func@@ tion@@ ality into version nine .
but then sometimes i &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
well , you can trip over 10 percent of the cu@@ stom@@ ers .
the first are economic , and they &apos;re really nic@@ ely sum@@ mari@@ zed in an ap@@ oc@@ r@@ yp@@ ha@@ l story about a back@@ -@@ and-@@ forth between hen@@ ry ford ii and walter re@@ u@@ ther , who was the head of the auto workers union .
i said , &quot; no .
if we take 10 kilo@@ grams of food -- and it results in one kilo@@ gram of bee@@ f , the other nine kilo@@ grams are waste , and a lot of that is man@@ ure .
that &apos;s where we were , 19@@ 00 .
and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tick@@ ling .
i was part of that united nations initiative called the alli@@ ance of civili@@ zations , which was asked by ko@@ fi an@@ n@@ an to diag@@ nose the causes of extre@@ mis@@ m , and to give practical gui@@ del@@ ines to me@@ mber states about how to avo@@ id the es@@ cal@@ ation of further extre@@ mis@@ m .
think about that for a minute .
i was me , but i was now me despite a li@@ m@@ p , and that , i suppose , was what now made me , me .
one day , a friend of mine , to bug me , brought a picture and said , &quot; what is the r@@ ough@@ ness of this cur@@ ve ? &quot;
and during my time in com@@ a , she had been la@@ id to rest in her home@@ town of pho@@ en@@ ix .
i could not believe i had ple@@ d@@ ged alle@@ gi@@ ance to research , where our job -- you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomen@@ a , for the exp@@ lic@@ it reason to control and predict .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
without the sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
and when you go to the beach , what do you get ? you get sand dun@@ es .
bab@@ ble@@ .com publi@@ s@@ her@@ s ru@@ f@@ us gr@@ is@@ com and al@@ is@@ a vol@@ k@@ man , in a li@@ vely ta@@ g-@@ team , exp@@ ose 4 facts that parents never , ever admit -- and why they should . funny and honest , for parents and non@@ parents ali@@ ke .
as a friend of mine says , &quot; life is a series of things you &apos;re not quite ready for . &quot;
if one guy has a really great car , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to re@@ act in an emergen@@ cy .
so we &apos;ve created , using our super@@ computer , the world &apos;s best computer model of malaria , which we &apos;ll show you now .
it looks na@@ st@@ y , like in college when you didn &apos;t like statistics .
but it has a certain -- -- it has a certain ring to it which is attra@@ ctive to people who read too much 19@@ th-@@ century german liter@@ ature .
why ? because the te@@ mes are sel@@ fish repli@@ cat@@ ors and they don &apos;t care about us , or our planet , or anything else .
people got up@@ set , but this is the only way we &apos;re going to go forward .
and as an experiment , because i da@@ un@@ t@@ ingly create a task for myself of re@@ creating a saturn v launch for this particular movie , because i put it out there , i felt a little nervous about it , so i need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a proje@@ ction room and play this stock footage , and when i played this stock footage , i simply wanted to find out what people remem@@ ber@@ ed , what was memor@@ able about it ?
and all we &apos;ve got is a room@@ b@@ a .
the green and red bars show that same signal dis@@ played by frequ@@ ency , with lower frequ@@ en@@ cies here and higher frequ@@ en@@ cies up here .
if you &apos;re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they &apos;re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
so this is where we get to yo@@ cha@@ i &apos;s discussion .
and so that is my story .
so here is a daily activity of the studio .
when you arri@@ ve you discover you &apos;ve lost one of them .
their gri@@ m plans were evi@@ dent .
so that &apos;s not so bad . i mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your brow@@ ser and there &apos;s news of a signal , or you get a c@@ up of coffee .
now my story has a lot to do with dre@@ aming , although i &apos;m known to make my dre@@ ams come true .
so we put in dogs mat@@ ing , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally absor@@ bed .
they were taking videos of buildings sha@@ king .
it &apos;s a bad idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
this year &apos;s s@@ wine flu stra@@ in grew very poor@@ ly in early production : basically .@@ 6 d@@ os@@ es per eg@@ g .
these are not election re@@ turns ; these are the percent@@ age of people who are over@@ weight .
thank you .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ cian .
you learn things un@@ consci@@ ously .
and it did , and it didn &apos;t .
now when you see these mountains , most people think of g@@ arb@@ age .
it &apos;s mathema@@ tically true , but it doesn &apos;t really talk about anything important -- because in these systems , the average isn &apos;t really what matters .
and in stand@@ -up of course , the stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an is supposed to domin@@ ate the audience .
at the age of 19 , i was on the national lea@@ der@@ ship of this organization in the u.@@ k .
so , ultimately what &apos;s going to determine the success or failure of se@@ ti is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of technologies , and the mean distance between technologies in the cos@@ mos -- distance over space and distance over time .
and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny , tiny size allows us to put the light wher@@ ever we really need it .
in the early 19@@ th century , church atten@@ dance in western europe started sli@@ ding down very , very shar@@ p@@ ly , and people p@@ ani@@ cked .
they wanted a sense of place .
take the g@@ 20 meeting a couple of weeks ago -- ste@@ pped back from its commit@@ ments of just a few months ago .
and every time , daily , after we have meeting , what com@@ promise we have , whatever , i go , i write a short email , send it .
you might also be asking whether it &apos;s possible that this is illegal for her to do this .
should i take vitamin c ? should i be taking whe@@ at@@ gr@@ ass ?
this animal &apos;s fossi@@ ls are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
the white line is for the u.k. , and then the u.s .
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
i was slowly los@@ ing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
what &apos;s happening in genom@@ ics , and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world , life , ourselves , and how we think about them .
over the coming months , i learned to breathe on my own , then to sit and to stand and to walk , but my body was now divi@@ ded ver@@ tically .
so i decided to do this experiment with people .
this new a@@ war@@ en@@ ess op@@ ens up vast possi@@ bilities for appli@@ cations that help improve our lives and ourselves .
collabor@@ ator : i felt really sa@@ d when he died .
so the key quanti@@ ty is earth &apos;s energy im@@ balance .
a very large s@@ ample is needed .
it has to be about transition .
so i &apos;ve got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 198@@ 0s .
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
number seven : partic@@ le acceler@@ ator mis@@ ha@@ p .
a few weeks ago , dan po@@ sted a vic@@ tor@@ i@@ ous post on our website , and i &apos;d like to read it to you .
d@@ j : so at this stage , i guess , we had very , very fir@@ m ideas on what conser@@ vation meant .
and so at this point the computer is proce@@ dur@@ ally anim@@ ating this cre@@ ature .
it &apos;s got to come from us , and i see this process of deci@@ ding democra@@ tically in a bot@@ tom@@ -up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crow@@ d@@ source the force to really build that con@@ stit@@ u@@ ency that &apos;s going to rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ate global govern@@ ance in the 21@@ st century .
we don &apos;t want one face .
thanks .
we &apos;re right in the thi@@ ck of it , this philosop@@ hi@@ cal thi@@ cket .
so it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
and they didn &apos;t just all ch@@ ase je@@ ep@@ s around .
my@@ ster@@ y number two : women have been in the olymp@@ ics for quite some time now , but one thing that &apos;s remarkable about all women spr@@ inter@@ s -- they all su@@ ck ; they &apos;re terrible .
and what i need to tell you is that on 100 ac@@ r@@ es he gets 4@@ 0,000 pounds of bee@@ f ; 30,000 pounds of por@@ k ; 2@@ 5,000 dozen eg@@ gs ; 20@@ ,000 bro@@ il@@ ers ; 1,000 tur@@ keys ; 1,000 rab@@ bits -- an im@@ men@@ se amount of food .
they move to new york city .
why did i say that ?
we actually have all of these cases where we over@@ come our biological limit@@ ations through technology and other means , seem@@ ingly pretty easily .
so we focused on motion capture .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to t@@ ack@@ le one of the most important questions in neurosci@@ ence : how are the brains of men and women different ?
put that in there . there we go .
and can i also make a small message to my mom ?
i &apos;m going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress , our old friend ken jen@@ n@@ ings . i &apos;m with him .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s there !
how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that ?
what i mean is the world holds me so ti@@ ghtly -- the good and the bad -- my own fol@@ lies and we@@ ak@@ ness that even this counter@@ f@@ eit ven@@ us with her sha@@ m heat , and her bos@@ om probably plum@@ ped with gel , so moves me my breath cat@@ ches .
this is what a real one looks like , on the juan de fu@@ ca ri@@ dge .
and i asked him , how long is it possible to go without brea@@ thing , like how long could i go without air ?
and so you can see that con@@ dom@@ s can do so many things .

and instead of p@@ lo@@ pping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .

the first is that the babies are listening int@@ ently to us , and they &apos;re taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they &apos;re taking statistics .
but right after that , pier@@ re -- in &apos; 96 , pier@@ re and i left our ful@@ l-@@ time jobs to build e@@ bay as a company . and the rest of that story , you know .

well , from that discussion grew this program that involved 2,@@ 7@@ 00 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world who enga@@ ged in 5@@ 40 ocean expe@@ di@@ tions at a combined cost of 6@@ 50 million dollars to study the distribution , diversity and ab@@ un@@ dance of life in the global ocean .
it &apos;s this absolutely phenomen@@ al dis@@ ruption of the imm@@ une system that is the key to why people die of this virus .

this is how it &apos;s shif@@ ting .

and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get poll@@ in@@ ators to do their bi@@ dding , they &apos;ve also somehow managed to per@@ su@@ ade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death , and particularly at marri@@ age , which , when you think of it , is the moment that en@@ cap@@ su@@ l@@ ates the transfer of genetic material from one organis@@ m to another .

and i think the whole thing ad@@ ds up much better if you do it like this .
now , because it &apos;s a bin@@ ary code , you can actually imple@@ ment this in hardware -- what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in african engineering schools .

one thing i &apos;m really interested about this right now is , how , if you &apos;re really taking this view of the universe as a computer , how do we make things in a very general sense , and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ?
beyond that , what i found most fascinating was the level of ende@@ mic corruption that i saw across all different countries , and particularly cent@@ ered around the heart of power , around public offi@@ ci@@ als who were em@@ be@@ zz@@ ling the public &apos;s money for their own personal en@@ rich@@ ment , and allowed to do that because of official secre@@ cy .
do we find a fl@@ ourishing civil society , a vi@@ gor@@ ous rule of law and good security ? no . what we find in afghanistan is a ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary that is weak and cor@@ rupt , a very limited civil society which is lar@@ gel@@ y in@@ effective , a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that &apos;s deeply un@@ popular , percei@@ ved as being deeply cor@@ rupt , and security that is sho@@ cking , security that &apos;s terrible .
so the horizon@@ tal images were all an in@@ version .
my grandmother was a hom@@ ema@@ ker .
and as we kept on scanning more and more , working on this project , looking at these two simple cells that have this kind of unbelie@@ vable machin@@ ery that will become the magic of you .
okay , well this was a week of my life in sle@@ ep@@ ing , and you get a z.@@ q@@ . sc@@ ore . instead of an i@@ .@@ q@@ . sc@@ ore , you get a z.@@ q@@ . sc@@ ore when you wake up .
so we sat together with a team which prepar@@ ed the bi@@ d book , or goal , that we said , let &apos;s a@@ im for percei@@ ved temperature , for out@@ door com@@ fort in this range , which is percei@@ ved with a temperature of 3@@ 2 degrees cel@@ si@@ us percei@@ ved temperature , which is extremely comfortable .
i &apos;m going to use this word &quot; damage &quot; to den@@ o@@ te these inter@@ medi@@ ate things that are caused by metaboli@@ sm and that eventually cause path@@ ology .
so it &apos;s exactly the way we get health information and phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical information , and it just sounds perfect .
and from that little eg@@ g , they pass through this spi@@ k@@ y little por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine fish stage , re@@ min@@ is@@ cent of their ance@@ stry , and develop -- this is their little adol@@ es@@ cent stage .
and i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and i spent four years with my colleagues adam pack and fab@@ i@@ en@@ ne del@@ four , working out in the field with this key@@ board using it with each other to do requ@@ est@@ s for toys while the dolphins were watching .
just to try and get an ass@@ ess@@ ment of what our gene re@@ per@@ to@@ ire was , we assem@@ bl@@ ed all the data -- including all of ours th@@ us far from the expedition , which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it tot@@ aled around 29 million genes .
i want to know the truth about justice -- like we have tru@@ ths in math .
now she used a small war to a@@ ver@@ t a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosop@@ hi@@ cal discussion about whether that was right , condi@@ tional good , or not right .
and then , we fa@@ st-@@ forward to about 193@@ 2 , when three itali@@ an psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , who were lar@@ gel@@ y treating depression , began to notice among their patients , who were also ep@@ ile@@ p@@ tics , that if they had an ep@@ ile@@ p@@ tic -- a series of ep@@ ile@@ p@@ tic f@@ its , a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequ@@ ently li@@ ft .
i know in@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely that skin you are hit@@ ting .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
you still with me ?
it also happens in the very real , fl@@ es@@ h and blood of acade@@ mic medicine . so in 19@@ 80 , some resear@@ ch@@ ers did a study on a drug called lor@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and this was an anti-@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drug , a drug that supp@@ res@@ ses ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they &apos;re quite likely to have ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , so if we give them a drug that supp@@ res@@ ses ab@@ normal heart rhyth@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving .
the finding suppor@@ ted darwin &apos;s theory by showing that fac@@ ial feedback modi@@ fi@@ es the neur@@ al process@@ ing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we s@@ mile .
and it &apos;s a new technology coming in , but then ama@@ zingly , how well it f@@ its to the economy of the countries . that &apos;s why the 100 dollar computer will be so important . but it &apos;s a nice tendency .
and ar@@ ab m@@ asses just revol@@ ted against their dic@@ tat@@ ors .
so if we cut open dra@@ cor@@ ex -- i cut open our dra@@ cor@@ ex -- and look , it was sp@@ ong@@ y inside , really sp@@ ong@@ y inside .
and it &apos;ll be growing over the next few months .
you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increas@@ es , people would che@@ at more , but in fact it wasn &apos;t the case .
we move along the wall , in what &apos;s called pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity oper@@ ations , looking for changes in color .
statistics show that we are living why ?
w@@ k : yeah . i &apos;m still thinking to work on energy .
because dop@@ am@@ ine , which f@@ loo@@ ds into your system when you &apos;re positive , has two functions .
they &apos;re like so@@ ap bub@@ bles that dis@@ appear when we touch them .
i do run a kind of a business -- i &apos;ve got 120 people and you &apos;ve got to pay them , so there &apos;s a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with , i think , a healthy inse@@ curity .
and i sent out one last bat@@ ch of post@@ cards .
really important .
the third , is this too much information ?
thank you very much .
take anything you want out of the su@@ it@@ case .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
they &apos;re closer to 50-@@ 50 . they &apos;re not respon@@ ding to pa@@ yo@@ ff@@ s as clos@@ ely , and also if you study their learning in the game , they aren &apos;t as sensitive to previous re@@ wards .
neurosci@@ enti@@ st daniel wol@@ per@@ t starts from a surprising pre@@ mis@@ e : the brain evolved , not to think or feel , but to control movement . in this enter@@ ta@@ ining , dat@@ a-@@ rich talk he gives us a glimp@@ se into how the brain creates the gra@@ ce and a@@ gi@@ li@@ ty of human motion .
and the ear@@ liest evidence for it c@@ rop@@ s up somewhere between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and jas@@ per and other things moving long distan@@ ces in eth@@ iop@@ ia .
this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there .
but it is so slow .
so you don &apos;t ki@@ ck . but you do use a small fli@@ ck .
but we had a philosoph@@ y , which is it only has to look good for a thousand@@ th of a second .
as@@ suming that a few of you did not do the assig@@ ned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distin@@ ction between zer@@ o-@@ sum games , in which cor@@ rela@@ tions are in@@ verse : always a w@@ inner and a loser .
radi@@ ologists classi@@ fy breast den@@ si@@ ty into four categories based on the appe@@ ar@@ ance of the tissue on a mammo@@ gram .
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back , i was thinking a lot about the familiar architec@@ tural forms that surro@@ unded me and how i would like to better rel@@ ate to them .
so let me give you a few examples here .
and i guess the story is that even na@@ vy se@@ als who are stung by the box j@@ el@@ ly , they &apos;re done .
just to give you gro@@ unds for compar@@ is@@ on , rice : 3@@ 5,000 genes .
but i &apos;ll sub@@ mit this to you : if you put one piece in the middle of this j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle , suddenly it all starts to form a co@@ her@@ ent picture .
so dan demonstr@@ ates the many self-@@ lear@@ ners who take this course off the web , on their own tra@@ ction , on their own initiative , and it &apos;s quite amazing because these people cannot care less about gra@@ des .
we &apos;re going to have some tomorrow .
b@@ c : ed@@ l is this im@@ men@@ se , techni@@ cally challenging problem .
this is from a global survey .
but let me tell you a bit about it today .
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about dis@@ connection .
an@@ nie had been killed , along with 20 members of her her@@ d .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
and , finally , i arrived at the following solution .
so there is now an al qa@@ e@@ da in the islam@@ ic ma@@ gh@@ re@@ b , there &apos;s an al qa@@ e@@ da in the arab@@ ian pen@@ insu@@ la , there is an al qa@@ e@@ da in mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the gol@@ den rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a h@@ unter gather@@ er society that has had no ex@@ pos@@ ure to any of the great religious tradi@@ tions , no ex@@ pos@@ ure to eth@@ ical philosoph@@ y , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deser@@ ves another , and that bad de@@ e@@ ds should be pun@@ ished .
and so , i remember night after night , you &apos;d hear all these men , these really har@@ den@@ ed crimin@@ als , hu@@ dd@@ led around john james , rec@@ iting , &quot; take that , sp@@ ide@@ y ! &quot;
in fact , we anti@@ cip@@ ated that star formation shouldn &apos;t proce@@ ed in that environment .
and it &apos;s a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divi@@ ded the body , and divi@@ ded care into de@@ part@@ ments and com@@ part@@ ments .
well , interestingly , in the last pres@@ identi@@ al election , who was the number one , active op@@ pon@@ ent of this system of regu@@ lation in online speech ?
this is an open@@ er for brian en@@ o , and it &apos;s just kind of my personal interpre@@ tation of the music .
but why stop there ?
now , i said all these animals are sort of working like po@@ go sticks -- they &apos;re boun@@ cing along as they move . and you can see that in this gh@@ ost cra@@ b , from the be@@ a@@ ches of pan@@ ama and north car@@ ol@@ ina .
we need to sa@@ vor smaller por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
but we need people like all of you in this room , le@@ ading thin@@ kers .
it &apos;s poin@@ tless . it &apos;s a poin@@ tless activity , which is precisely why it &apos;s so important .
so then of the energy that does get to the whe@@ els , only an eigh@@ th of it , half of that , goes to heat the ti@@ r@@ es on the road , or to heat the air the car p@@ us@@ hes asi@@ de .
and this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experim@@ entation .
the government is not successful on these things .
it killed almost everything that was left .
i bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages , in the slums , in the hinter@@ land of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius , without any outside help .
and influ@@ ential voices came up with one answer .
so something will resol@@ ve down to the information about a particular person , so every person will have a unique id .
the whole thing took two days out of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ day week .
the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
and if you ask me , will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that &apos;s very hard to say .
this is a u.s. stati@@ stic about the impact of greenhouse gas@@ es .
a ver@@ tic@@ al-@@ ta@@ ke@@ off aircraft , like the hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird , has a very high metaboli@@ sm , which means it requ@@ ires a lot of energy .
30 years of r@@ ose gar@@ den diplom@@ acy have not delivered us peace in this conflict .
perhaps one of the biggest comp@@ on@@ ents of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it .
but she &apos;s married , so i &apos;m going to have to get her spli@@ t up from her hus@@ band . &quot;
never &quot; hi , jack . &quot;
that means your police force wasn &apos;t working .
what is it that we &apos;re actually -- what story are we actually telling ?
but , in any case , the de@@ f@@ lation of this glac@@ ier since 198@@ 4 has been higher than the ei@@ ffel tower , higher than the em@@ pi@@ re state building .
it &apos;s not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic p@@ ill that cur@@ es all , but it &apos;s going to be part of the solution .
in the 198@@ 0s , as america went through a transition in the re@@ ag@@ an period , between the r@@ ust b@@ elt economy of the mi@@ d@@ west to the si@@ lic@@ on valley economy of california , that was the end of america .
it is physics . you know , the sort of first principles reason@@ ing .
and so cars , as art , brings it into an emotional plane -- if you acc@@ ept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a .
that gives us a time series of how frequ@@ ently this particular sent@@ ence was used over time .
what exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
wei@@ ght@@ fully this self which wei@@ gh@@ ed upon me , the rel@@ ease from which is what i des@@ ire and what i achieve .
and i was sitting in a hall@@ way one night and a couple girls came up to me .
and i &apos;ve also added in this diag@@ ram now some pin@@ k lines that go down and to the right .
it &apos;s a kind lo@@ an@@ er from ted .
have some of it .
today i &apos;m going to show you an electric vehicle that wei@@ gh@@ s less than a bi@@ cycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can char@@ ge off a normal wall out@@ let in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity .
mil@@ o &apos;s mom : oh , you &apos;ve got gra@@ vy all over the floor .
we might divide it -- the plum@@ ber would say , &quot; well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot;
it &apos;s gone .
they &apos;re actually con@@ fi@@ dent that they have liked con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on pri@@ cing all along .
sp@@ ends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who se@@ es dead people , and then , bo@@ om -- &quot; oh , i &apos;m dead &quot; -- peri@@ pe@@ tia .
i just don &apos;t believe that .
and i know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a c@@ rum@@ my camera at the time -- but i was ec@@ sta@@ tic .
pro@@ bio@@ tics are one thing that you can try and do to re@@ store the micro@@ bial community that is in and on you .
it was energy , love and joy .
it &apos;s right off the library . and there we serve all 5@@ 29 kids in this middle school .
this was a wonderful place , because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there .
so , i was fortunate enough to be born a very dre@@ am@@ y child .
do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ?
what all of these things have in common is that they cost money .
i worry because all around me , even within my ex@@ tended family , i see religion being mani@@ pul@@ ated .
this science is different , more general , than the mathema@@ tic@@ s-@@ based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
they &apos;re not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-@@ g@@ all@@ on plastic ba@@ g .
g@@ b : yes , but i think europe has got a position , which is 27 countries have already come together .
well , what does that mean ? well , look out even further than we &apos;ve just been -- i mean from here , with a telescope -- and you &apos;ll see things that look like stars .
and flowers are a real bu@@ g@@ ger .
maybe i could become a film@@ maker .
and 20@@ 2@@ 8 , 20@@ 30 ? it &apos;s just around the corner .
i can &apos;t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a s@@ mile on my face and do what i used to do gla@@ dly for them .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m doing it for mov@@ ember . &quot; and i said , &quot; so am i@@ . &quot; and i said , &quot; tell me your mov@@ ember story . &quot;
in 199@@ 5 , we started working on a two-@@ year investi@@ ga@@ tive research project to try and find out what was going on .
if there &apos;s a child in trouble , we be@@ am a gr@@ an .
so i can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sen@@ ti@@ ent .
these are the people that defin@@ e the requi@@ re@@ ments of the technology , and these are the people that have to give the thum@@ b@@ s-@@ up at the end , and say , &quot; yeah , it actually works . it me@@ ets our needs . &quot;
and so i just came , two days ago , from the himala@@ y@@ as to your kind invi@@ tation .
with the universe as a computer , you can look at this drop@@ let of water as having per@@ formed the compu@@ tations .
like , that &apos;s the dum@@ best reason i &apos;ve ever heard for ap@@ pl@@ ying to law school .
now this eleph@@ ant does something illegal that we did not teach it .
so thank you again , so much .
so clearly , her clothes were l@@ ent to various different women .
and i think , as a conc@@ ep@@ tual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human d@@ w@@ elling , that makes it not much use .
in the first s@@ ession -- we had three s@@ essi@@ ons over the course of two years .
jim camer@@ on actually photograph@@ ed the real titanic .
she &apos;s not even my real m@@ um .
and hopefully inspi@@ re people to go to that website .
so you know how it ended up , spen@@ cer tra@@ cy brought a computer , a main@@ frame computer of 195@@ 7 , in to help the libr@@ ari@@ ans .
and the problem with this stuff is , now that the bill &apos;s come due , it turns out s@@ ant@@ a isn &apos;t quite as c@@ ute when it &apos;s sum@@ mer@@ time .
so , something has got to give . and that is what i want .
well , i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters , so -- and each time , i didn &apos;t expect to come home to tell the tale .
the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale hi@@ des the scale of the increase , because this represents trilli@@ on@@ s-@@ fold increase since the 18@@ 90 cen@@ sus .
her email was read , and she spo@@ ke at the united nations head@@ quar@@ ters , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to priv@@ acy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
i was very moved by what i saw today .
he combined the tremendous skills of a ge@@ ek with the su@@ a@@ ve social engineering skills of the master crimin@@ al .
so , a huge problem .
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
what we have now is the end of the rise of the west . that &apos;s over .
and my heart s@@ ank , because i thought , here we are again .
and what happens is when we test people one week later , a month later , three months later , they &apos;re both happ@@ ier and less depres@@ sed .
these reac@@ tors oper@@ ate at essentially atmos@@ pher@@ ic pressure , so there &apos;s no in@@ cl@@ ination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident .
the bios@@ phere is the size of the earth .
i &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by ab@@ c news .
chris anderson , the edi@@ tor of &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; wired &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; , explor@@ es the four key st@@ ages of any vi@@ able technology : setting the right price , ga@@ ining market share , dis@@ plac@@ ing an establi@@ shed technology and , finally , becoming ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
and they estim@@ ated that 1.@@ 6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in europe because of noise pollution .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of money for it , no government money .
now , imagine each one of these var@@ ie@@ ties as being distinct from another about the same way as a po@@ od@@ le from a great dan@@ e .
they lau@@ gh@@ ed . they dis@@ mis@@ sed us .
and i &apos;ll never forget the day i was called in by a me@@ mber of top management and told to stop associ@@ ating with any known or suspe@@ cted environ@@ ment@@ alists .
simply thro@@ wing data over the tran@@ so@@ m doesn &apos;t change how government works .
and even animals , like these don@@ keys , love our buildings .
i had to make a transfer at the 5@@ 3@@ rd st. stop where there are these two giant es@@ cal@@ ators .
it made their feeling of security more mat@@ ch the reality .
i &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in ic@@ eland .
i &apos;m going to call that &quot; robust human re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation . &quot; ok .
and when you feed these kids bad food , that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . so that &apos;s really what this is all about .
or what &apos;s not happening in the large hadron collider in c@@ ern .
&quot; i &apos;m convinced , &quot; i told a german official with the world bank , &quot; that it would be impossible for them to be bri@@ bed if they worked in ger@@ many , in a german administra@@ tion , just as i am convinced that if you put german offi@@ ci@@ als from the german administra@@ tion in those holes , they would be bri@@ bed just the same . &quot;
they would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an autom@@ ated rep@@ ly .
that earth would likely warm in the 19@@ 80 &apos;s , and warming would ex@@ ce@@ ed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century .
all right , un@@ tie me now and we &apos;ll get some dinner . &quot;
just think about that , you know ?
it turns out that the value of bu@@ ying a lot@@ tery ti@@ cket is not winning .
the babies in the united states are getting a lot better , babies in japan are getting a lot worse , but both of those groups of babies are prepar@@ ing for exactly the language that they are going to learn .
no matter where you look , what this is pl@@ ot@@ ting is the size of the relationship between dis@@ g@@ ust sensi@@ tivity and political ori@@ entation , and no matter where we looked , we saw a very similar effect .
but we have to recognize that we have those limit@@ ations .
you cannot be constra@@ ined by the public &apos;s opinion .
they basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn &apos;t &quot; achieve &quot; her up ti@@ ll now .
well , i haven &apos;t seen the original 4@@ 2 studies and i can &apos;t com@@ ment on that me@@ ta@@ -@@ ana@@ y@@ sis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines .
you return to where you started .
and it takes you a while until it actually -- you realize that this says something different than what it norm@@ ally says .
some guy &apos;s got that on a computer -- there &apos;s this like , oh my goo@@ dness .
in asia alone , it will be over a billion people .
you &apos;d think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn &apos;t be such su@@ ck@@ ers just for the pretty phones .
the other kind of re@@ vie@@ wer is a certain fla@@ vor of femin@@ ist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be .
they have no benefits : they don &apos;t have social security ; they don &apos;t have pen@@ sion ; they don &apos;t have healthcare ; none of those things .
see , these are totally different worlds .
you can end up saving money , and lives , and oil , all at the same time .
so it was much sa@@ fer for me to land at the bottom .
there &apos;s a new field in brain science , social neurosci@@ ence .
and today is em@@ manu@@ el &apos;s day , i think we &apos;ve agre@@ ed that , already , haven &apos;t we ?
and what you can do is just , if you give it a t@@ wir@@ l , well they just keep going on .
i wanted to create environments that moved and mor@@ ph@@ ed like an illu@@ si@@ on@@ ist .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler told him , &quot; you bring me the best workers that you can find , and if they are good enough , i will hi@@ re them . &quot;
and these are fl@@ y@@ tra@@ p an@@ em@@ ones .
well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human sen@@ ses . but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a telescope , even one of pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day design , look out and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here .
that &apos;s the value of living .
a@@ hh@@ h .
this is nothing . i am being st@@ al@@ ked across the web .
so i feel connected to each language in a different way .
but you lose that contra@@ ct for a major brand name , that &apos;s the difference between staying in business or going ban@@ k@@ rupt .
when i arrived off the plane , after a very long journey from the west of england , my computer , my belo@@ ved laptop , had gone mad , and had -- oh ! -- a bit like that ! -- and the display on it -- anyway , the whole thing had bur@@ st .
and rum@@ i &apos;s stories are metaph@@ ors for the spiritu@@ al path .
so he pi@@ cked 27 profession@@ als -- they were engineers , physi@@ ci@@ sts , mathemati@@ cians , architects , fur@@ ni@@ ture designers even , artists -- and he asked them to come along one evening , and to bring a problem with them that they were working on .
and -- perhaps nai@@ vely -- i was surprised to find that there isn &apos;t even an area in the sci@@ ences that deals with this idea of global species lon@@ ge@@ vity .
thank you .
and if you believe that , then stuff like this doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther you . this is 1996 : &quot; all the nega@@ tives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble . &quot;
so you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics .
frei@@ t@@ as has a design for a robo@@ tic white blood cell .
so they will , in fact , be quite easy for us to detect .
and when that v@@ ap@@ or bub@@ ble collap@@ ses , it em@@ its sound , light and heat , and it &apos;s a very de@@ struc@@ tive process .
so if you start a trip at 9 a.@@ m@@ . , by noon you want to stop to have a bi@@ te to eat , hit the re@@ st@@ room , coffee , and keep going .
so we said , this looks bad .
and he whi@@ pped out his cell@@ phone , di@@ aled the number , and a voice said , &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot;
i wanted to cul@@ tiv@@ ate this perspective just like the mush@@ rooms , so i formed the de@@ comp@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture society , a group of people called de@@ comp@@ in@@ au@@ ts who ac@@ tively explore their post@@ mor@@ tem options , se@@ ek death accep@@ t@@ ance and cul@@ tiv@@ ate de@@ comp@@ os@@ ing organis@@ ms like the infin@@ ity mush@@ room .
i grew up in a typical american town near st. louis .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
but all that belief had fu@@ eled me so long .
a 21@@ -year-old mon@@ k . he was very happy .
we know from our personal experiences that it &apos;s easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
we had to find and measure the largest cro@@ co@@ di@@ les living today .
thank you very much .
so if we take an example -- p@@ to@@ le@@ my had do@@ zens of data points to support his theory that the planets would ro@@ tate around the earth .
two years ago , on ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 2010 , i called my father .
so , i &apos;m gradu@@ ating college and , feeling very ide@@ ali@@ stic , i decided to join the n@@ go which actually was using new media to pro@@ mote democracy and media re@@ form in much of the former so@@ vi@@ et union .
this is the national pal@@ ace -- the equivalent of the white house .
so before i play this video , i want to tell you that they created it in the last three days after getting a call from chris .
i have a neigh@@ bor who knows 200 types of wine .
be pr@@ ou@@ d that you have them .
i think it will not come from u@@ fo@@ s .
the solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think , because all of those cities we &apos;re building are opportunities .
the guy has no idea what to do .
if you think about it , in history , a long , long time ago we de@@ alt with the problem of an individual ab@@ using another individual .
why are there women and men ?
these are the same bon@@ ds that hold hydro@@ carb@@ ons together .
and once we have that , then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say , if we understand the fundamental process@@ es that do not re@@ fer to any particular sub@@ strate , then we can go out and try other worlds , figure out what kind of chemical al@@ phab@@ ets might there be , figure enough about the normal chemistry , the geo@@ chemistry of the planet , so that we know what this distribution would look like in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of life , and then look for large devi@@ ations from this -- this thing sti@@ cking out , which says , &quot; this chemical really shouldn &apos;t be there . &quot;
and if you saw the movie , you know , he thro@@ ws it down and it becomes a s@@ na@@ ke .
&quot; i want to hold my breath for a really long time . how could it be done ? &quot;
you &apos;re going to open an off@@ sh@@ ore plant in china , you &apos;re going to spend it all on sal@@ es and marketing , you &apos;re going to go to ta@@ hit@@ i , or whatever out there .
the ti@@ tle is &quot; the power of movement in plants . &quot;
it &apos;s value created by the partici@@ pan@@ ts for each other .
but a standard industrial pump@@ ing loo@@ p was re@@ designed to use at least 8@@ 6 percent less energy , not by getting better pump@@ s , but just by re@@ plac@@ ing long , thin , cro@@ o@@ ked pi@@ p@@ es with fat , short , straight pi@@ p@@ es .
they built a new house , this time with running water , electricity , a bi@@ cycle , no pig .
want to publi@@ sh glob@@ ally anything you think today ?
but for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know@@ -@@ how ; we have the c@@ ash ; we have the life@@ -@@ saving drugs .
just as i was leaving to come here tonight , one of my daugh@@ ters started scre@@ aming .
i &apos;ll just wind up by saying that i think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
so were the follo@@ wers of hip@@ po@@ cr@@ ates .
la@@ stly , you want to be the nur@@ turing ag@@ ent .
ro@@ wdie , ro@@ wdie , let &apos;s get ro@@ wdie . &quot;
my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in clean@@ ing toile@@ ts for a living ?
she doesn &apos;t want to be like , &quot; you &apos;re too old to drive . &quot;
another explanation that you often hear for re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness is hu@@ br@@ is .
i had my own &quot; lost time &quot; moment , where i wo@@ ke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day , almost din@@ ner@@ time , and she had not come back .
and all i &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these sli@@ des is that i do just very straight stuff .
and people could never get their bag@@ s up it .
so we &apos;re not -- we &apos;re pretty klu@@ d@@ ge-@@ y ourselves .
imag@@ in@@ ative play .
it &apos;s not just competi@@ tive , it &apos;s also car@@ ing .
you can only r@@ ar@@ ely be in the right place to find sharks into aug@@ ust .
it &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
actually , those action video game play@@ ers have many other advan@@ tages in terms of attention , and one aspe@@ ct of attention which is also impro@@ ved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
they und@@ ou@@ b@@ ted@@ ly will . they have .
thank you .
this is low speed , low wind speed , and the man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ability is very increased , and here i &apos;m going to do a small ji@@ be , and look at the position of the sa@@ il .
from kan@@ s@@ as , i moved on to lo@@ vely ari@@ zon@@ a , where i taught in flag@@ staff for a number of years , this time with middle school students .
for example , there &apos;s excell@@ ent reason to believe that virtu@@ ally all humans are born with a moral sense , and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .
and the third big change is that members of the former audience , as dan gil@@ more call@@ s them , can now also be produc@@ ers and not consum@@ ers .
he was a brilliant scientist at the fron@@ ti@@ ers of mathematics , even as a teenager .
to take advantage of when the temperature drop@@ s in the fall , ge@@ ese and du@@ cks gor@@ ge on food to pre@@ p@@ are for the har@@ sh reali@@ ties of winter .
i should cl@@ ari@@ fy that .
believe me , there &apos;s a whole lot easier ways to make money .
they were the first to be treated by focused ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und .
she &apos;s ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating . &quot;
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy was of the first bri@@ tish atom@@ ic bom@@ b test .
not many people check box@@ es .
and i think when i draw drawings which may imit@@ ate the computer , but are not computer drawings -- drawings that can come from sour@@ ces that are completely not known , not normal , not seen , yet the hand -- and that &apos;s what i really , to all of you who are working -- how can we make the computer respon@@ d to our hand rather than the hand respon@@ ding to the computer .
dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
so you &apos;d think that us , as a successful species on the planet -- you , me , everybody -- would be really good at making these tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
we can transport them around the world .
it &apos;s becoming , i think , a really great institution .
astro@@ lab@@ es have an incredible history .
thank you very much .
we got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain ens@@ hr@@ ined for@@ ever , for everybody , take a look .
oli@@ via ? huh ? huh ?
they say , well , we have a thing in a box , and we have its in@@ puts and its out@@ puts .
but the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succe@@ ed the second time .
&quot; we just wanted to say we tried . &quot;
ly@@ n@@ n cra@@ ig : where there ten@@ ds to be water , at least on earth , there ten@@ ds to be life , and so it &apos;s potenti@@ ally a place where life could have exi@@ sted on the planet in the past .
so i just wanted to see , is this the image you need to get ?
neil tu@@ ro@@ k : so ten@@ da@@ i came to a@@ im@@ s and did very well .
we don &apos;t know people from iran .
and he also plays golf , like you do in virginia when you are reti@@ red .
so after we made our discover@@ ies with little c. elegan@@ s , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same da@@ f-@@ 2 mutation , the hor@@ m@@ one rec@@ ep@@ tor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
and i realized that , if they had to go into com@@ bat , they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .
i have been fortunate to have had these magni@@ fic@@ ant students and post-@@ doc@@ s who have taught me so much , and i have had many of these groups come and go .
of course , most of china was fl@@ ourishing at the time , but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china .
darwin is a great example of this .
the reason we &apos;re not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence pres@@ er@@ vation in our ju@@ di@@ cial system , but that &apos;s another whole ted@@ x talk for later .
i &apos;ll try to spin a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a convenient starting place .
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separ@@ ation to the al-@@ s@@ hab@@ a@@ ab mili@@ tia in somalia .
and that makes it extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting as a place to explore .
what ban@@ ged ? &quot;
but now , we &apos;re hit@@ ting , as i &apos;ve just described , we &apos;re hit@@ ting the third repli@@ cat@@ or point .
a yellow sign ? that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;ll be expe@@ cting .
and i don &apos;t know that there is any way responsi@@ bly for someone to start medi@@ c@@ ating their children with their personal supply of li@@ pit@@ or or something of that nature .
if you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try china -- there &apos;s old con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
i &apos;ve talked about what &apos;s des@@ per@@ ately necessary .
and without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other univer@@ ses .
i be@@ g to diff@@ er with mark t@@ wa@@ in , though .
what &apos;s cle@@ ver is the way the fly fl@@ aps it , which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system , and this is what enab@@ les flies to per@@ form these remarkable a@@ eri@@ al man@@ eu@@ vers .
well , i &apos;ll quickly show you two options .
in the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination .
i think you can get change .
my base of oper@@ ations is in the u.s. , but let &apos;s start at the other end of the map , in k@@ yo@@ to , japan , where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dis@@ ser@@ tational research 15 years ago .
and what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
because i ha@@ dn &apos;t told them what i was doing , because i was so up@@ set with the story they &apos;d run .
and this school , named after the u.k. &apos; s first female doctor , and the surro@@ unding buildings named for mexi@@ can artist fri@@ da ka@@ hl@@ o , mary se@@ ac@@ ole , the ja@@ mai@@ can nurse known as the &quot; black fl@@ or@@ ence ni@@ ght@@ ing@@ ale , &quot; and the english author , e@@ mi@@ ly br@@ on@@ te , honor women who f@@ ought sex@@ ism , ra@@ c@@ ism and ignor@@ ance , to pur@@ su@@ e their passi@@ ons to feed their own sou@@ ls .
and at the risk of so@@ unding gran@@ di@@ ose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of vis@@ ually im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get these .
then , a little bit later , i start getting some pictures like this .
anes@@ thes@@ ia gave them the freedom to experiment , to start to del@@ ve deeper into the body .
but what was interesting was the ad@@ ult tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops was also sp@@ ong@@ y .
they &apos;re almost like a national tv station .
in the short time period i have , i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
1.@@ 5 million people stu@@ ff@@ ed into mu@@ d or metal hu@@ ts with no services , no toile@@ ts , no rights .
and now about these n@@ in@@ ja pa@@ jam@@ as .
this building con@@ tains the world &apos;s largest collection of docum@@ ents and arti@@ facts com@@ memor@@ ating the u.s. role in figh@@ ting on the chinese side in that long war -- the flying ti@@ gers .
and i realized that if i sc@@ aled them up , they would provide me with good spa@@ ti@@ al qualities , for venti@@ lation , for ther@@ mal com@@ fort , and for other things .
you can see in 1997 , we put lin@@ u@@ x on the cover .
and i therefore believe that opti@@ mis@@ m is what drives architecture forward .
so , not to pick on b@@ m@@ w , or to cele@@ bra@@ te them , but take b@@ m@@ w as an example .
either one , you &apos;re going to lose . what i do is , i take out the memory card , and i fold it in half , reve@@ aling us@@ b con@@ tac@@ ts .
and i think this is where climate change skep@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
so for example , take ris@@ k-@@ taking . we know that adol@@ esc@@ ents have a tendency to take ris@@ ks . they do .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
so here &apos;s a model where a two-@@ whe@@ el@@ er was@@ h@@ ing machine ...
powerpoint has this built into every copy of powerpoint that &apos;s shi@@ pped .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and , very happ@@ ily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
every time i listen to that , i get go@@ ose bu@@ mp@@ s .
add up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; let &apos;s start a program in the united states . &quot; so , end of aug@@ ust , early september , we decide to do this . we anno@@ un@@ ced it near the middle , end -- just when the clin@@ ton initiative was taking place .
the fact is , is that the bri@@ tish museum had a complete spec@@ im@@ en of a do@@ do in their collection up until the 18@@ th century -- it was actually mum@@ mi@@ fied , skin and all -- but in a fit of spac@@ e-@@ saving ze@@ al , they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they bur@@ ned the rest in a bon@@ fire .
we are as@@ suming that our societies are going to be based on mi@@ str@@ ust .
and they have become excell@@ ent partners .
and fortun@@ ately , my brazi@@ lian friends were more than ready to help .
compar@@ is@@ on . trou@@ bling compar@@ is@@ on . let me show you .
and to connect our country after world war ii , we didn &apos;t build more two-@@ lan@@ e high@@ ways , we built the inter@@ state highway system .
this is what we dream about . its individu@@ ality , demonstr@@ ated in the sky@@ line . it &apos;s res@@ ili@@ ence .
and to really illu@@ strate this point , what i &apos;d like to do is to show you how technology has de@@ alt with a very simple , a very common , an everyday question .
on bright ni@@ ghts when there is lots of star@@ light or mo@@ on@@ light that light can pen@@ et@@ rate the dep@@ th of the water the squ@@ id lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
i started looking at my own work : the work that i had done for the previous 10 years , almost every time , that people had shared .
that means that afri@@ c@@ ans have been acc@@ um@@ ulating this mu@@ tational diversity for longer .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c climate shif@@ ts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today .
they travel@@ ed all around europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .
and when i now finally got it right , i can go back 200 years in history .
i had so much fun han@@ ging out with you last night , i wonder if i could do it again tonight . &quot;
now , i &apos;m not a scientist , that &apos;ll be really clear .
there &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , maybe i can break the little glass c@@ ei@@ ling of carto@@ on@@ ing , &quot; and so i did . i became a carto@@ on@@ ist .
is health a function of positive enga@@ gement , of pleas@@ ure , and of meaning in life ?
and that my@@ th is pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dangerous .
david fan@@ ton : hi , i &apos;m david fan@@ ton . i just want to say a couple quick things .
now today , i told you about very strange and weird proto@@ cells -- some that con@@ tain clay , some that have pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al o@@ o@@ ze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them .
we see it on blo@@ gs all over the place .
so when we are con@@ fron@@ ted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : we can look away , or we can address the image .
a condu@@ ctive pen from the le@@ wi@@ s lab at u@@ i@@ uc .
and important to note that almost all of the weight , all of the people in this organization are at the bottom .
the same is true of marketing .
hope isn &apos;t a bug .
my back@@ ground is not exactly conven@@ tional medical training .
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can &apos;t all stay clu@@ ster@@ ed up like this .
we need to learn from those fig@@ ures that i mentioned .
working with four pris@@ ons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustain@@ ability and conser@@ vation projects to four state pris@@ ons .
so , i was convinced . we designed it to be i@@ con@@ ic , to look different . to look like it &apos;s for a kid , but not like a to@@ y .
the private sector as well .
it was for a char@@ ity in connec@@ tic@@ ut when i was a con@@ gr@@ ess@@ woman , and i got up there , &quot; and she went on and on , &quot; and then i got on the stage . &quot;
har@@ ry went back to new york , asked his brother who &apos;s an investment ban@@ ker to lo@@ an him the 3@@ ,000 dollars , and his brother &apos;s im@@ mor@@ tal words were , &quot; you i@@ di@@ ot , nobody e@@ ats hambur@@ gers . &quot;
ok ? i just , this is why i love what michael does , because it &apos;s like , ok , if he &apos;s de@@ bun@@ king it , then i don &apos;t have to .
and to find a star@@ ry sky like this is even more difficult .
your name is ?
that &apos;s great .
the dark blue here is sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
it just -- you don &apos;t want to do that .
i said , i &apos;m never going to make any honest public comm@@ ent@@ ary again .
it &apos;s an amazing notion .
this gives us a measure of mental work@@ load , how much the driver is actually challen@@ ged cogni@@ tively at any point along the track .
it was deeply classi@@ fied .
and remember , the vote is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted from the moment you leave the vot@@ ing boot@@ h , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
sw : yeah .
dan phil@@ li@@ ps : creative houses from rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed stuff
tradition@@ ally , the kal@@ an@@ dar community of india has survi@@ ved by cap@@ turing sl@@ oth be@@ ar cu@@ bs and training them to &quot; dance &quot; through extreme cru@@ el@@ ty . k@@ arti@@ ck sat@@ yan@@ ar@@ a@@ y@@ an has been able to put an end to this cent@@ u@@ ries@@ -@@ old practice , and in so doing discovered a less@@ on of wi@@ der significance : make the practi@@ tion@@ ers part of the solution .
as a result , in the russi@@ an far east today , which is twice the size of india , you have exactly six million russi@@ ans .
here , i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal fl@@ ush .
there are more people being rap@@ ed . there are more wars .
the sculp@@ tor richard ser@@ ra talks about how , as a young artist , he thought he was a pain@@ ter , and he lived in fl@@ or@@ ence after gradu@@ ate school .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to char@@ ge and really cheap to build , but it also redu@@ ces the foot@@ print of your energy use in terms of your transpor@@ tation .
and you know what ? it &apos;s just the beginning .
as i realized , just like with many many things in my life that i actually love , i adap@@ t to it .
what the site &apos;s known for , because it has this environment , is it &apos;s fo@@ ster@@ ed the creation of a lot of internet phenomen@@ a , vi@@ ral videos and what@@ not , known as &quot; memes . &quot;
i pain@@ ted a whole picture of the animal kingdom , and humanity included , was that deep down we are competi@@ tors , we are aggressi@@ ve , we &apos;re all out for our own profit basically .
and we &apos;re working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id , and the plac@@ ent@@ a , which have those proper@@ ties .
and that imp@@ lies test@@ ability , the scientific me@@ thod , the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , and everything .
and as it ran , this thing was saying , &quot; give me input . give me input . &quot;
this here is nis@@ san &apos;s my@@ lea@@ f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compe@@ te for who drives around the most fuel effici@@ ently .
so here i am taking care of bec@@ k at 21@@ ,000 feet , and i felt what i was doing was completely tri@@ vi@@ al compared to what he had done for himself .
the first step was to ask a question .
and , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean turns into a des@@ ert .
and we keep doing that , and build more powerful machines , acceler@@ ators for particles .
but scot@@ t &apos;s journey rema@@ ins un@@ finished .
imagine , these are har@@ den@@ ed cyber@@ crimin@@ als sharing information scar@@ c@@ ely .
we got that many people to partici@@ pate by bu@@ ying ful@@ l-@@ page ads in the new york times , in the boston glo@@ be , in pri@@ me@@ time radio and tv ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
the brain scans showed ac@@ tivation in a part of the brain called the insu@@ la , a region they say is lin@@ ked to feelings of love and compassion .
we all know about the mira@@ cle of mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation .
and that means united states was richer , but lost more kids than india is doing today , propor@@ tion@@ ally .
my people build all the time with clay , but they don &apos;t see any innovation with mu@@ d .
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
and what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ alization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
employees volunte@@ er time in the ad@@ vice boot@@ h .
mur@@ mur@@ s causes all of the feelings to fly to the c@@ ei@@ ling .
artists also speak about how p@@ ush@@ ing up against the limit@@ s of what they can do , sometimes p@@ ush@@ ing into what they can &apos;t do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
we put the stor@@ age of memes out there on a clay tab@@ let , but in order to get true te@@ mes and true te@@ me machines , you need to get the variation , the selec@@ tion and the cop@@ ying , all done outside of humans .
they ti@@ ed the re@@ bar right , they p@@ ou@@ red the col@@ um@@ ns right , and that building will be safe .
comp@@ are that with the device rel@@ eas@@ ed just months ago that &apos;s now pac@@ ka@@ ged into something the size of a key fo@@ b , and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps recei@@ ver , which is only a centi@@ meter on a side and more sensitive than ever , you realize that the gps do@@ t will soon move from fi@@ ction to non@@ fi@@ ction .
and to the person who was pro@@ mot@@ ing it said , &quot; the atmosphere &apos;s much more complicated . &quot;
so i &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . ft .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , i do not stand here today to tell you about the gl@@ ory of weap@@ ons .
in the &apos; 90s , it was 1@@ 3@@ th , and not because standards had fallen , but because they had ris@@ en so much faster elsewhere .
dh : i touched it , bar@@ ry . that should be enough .
ju@@ dge for@@ er qu@@ its , and m@@ s. de@@ we@@ y in completely dis@@ hear@@ tened .
my mom plays piano , and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in cape bre@@ ton . before mom &apos;s family had a piano in cape bre@@ ton , she learned to play the rhyth@@ ms on a piece of board , and the fi@@ dd@@ lers would all con@@ gre@@ gate to play on the cold winter &apos;s ev@@ en@@ ings and mom would be ban@@ ging on this board , so when they bought a piano , they bought it in toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse , a horse and s@@ lei@@ gh to the house .
hope brought me to america .
this meas@@ ures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain .
we &apos;ve also been working in design .
what &apos;s interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world , is , i think , only one of four different ways that mani@@ fest themselves in different fields of ende@@ a@@ vor .
but what is the future of qu@@ ant@@ um le@@ vi@@ tation and qu@@ ant@@ um lo@@ cking ?
peter ei@@ gen : how to exp@@ ose the cor@@ rupt

steve jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi@@ -@@ touch .
i have to explain that to you .
there &apos;s obviously diversity . huge numbers of things .
but right now , you pretty much have to take si@@ lic@@ on , put it in an o@@ ven at 1@@ 600 degrees fahr@@ en@@ heit for 17 hours , to make the cells .
but we have to change from the industrial model to an agri@@ cultural model , where each school can be fl@@ ourishing tomorrow .
and if you remember one thing from what i want to talk about today , it &apos;s that the only way to end poverty , to make it history , is to build vi@@ able systems on the ground that deli@@ ver critical and aff@@ ord@@ able goo@@ ds and services to the poor , in ways that are finan@@ cially sustainable and sc@@ al@@ e@@ able .
in fact , that &apos;s progress .
and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing .
don &apos;t try that one .

that &apos;s human heart .
i had a degree from cambridge ; i had a thri@@ ving career , but my self was a car crash , and i wo@@ und up with bu@@ li@@ mia and on a therap@@ ist &apos;s cou@@ ch .
so it &apos;s a chance to get more , but it &apos;s pretty ris@@ k@@ y .
so the 99 work in teams of three .
this goes on for another four stops .
over tens of thousands of generations , such skills increased the status of those who dis@@ played them and ga@@ ined a re@@ productive advantage over the less capable .
i &apos;m not sure what these people think , because i don &apos;t speak nor@@ s@@ k .

so , the god vis@@ hn@@ u arrived .
you could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , &quot; go for it , kid , just like i did . &quot;
there are , true enough , in europe and the west , when women and men have equal access to food and health care , there are more women , we live longer .
it &apos;s hard to imagine . people grew food , and they ate food .
you have to put in hundreds of micros@@ cop@@ ic wir@@ es to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fi@@ bers that put out tiny signals that are micro@@ vol@@ ts .
and when you make them light in the right way , that can be sim@@ pl@@ er and che@@ aper to make .
how might we improve access to safe drin@@ king water for the world &apos;s poor@@ est people , and at the same time stim@@ u@@ late innovation am@@ ong@@ st local water provi@@ ders ?
so , that &apos;s the positive side of it .
and in that sense , the ab@@ ra@@ ham path is a gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger .
and we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wan@@ ting to track down the source -- saying , &quot; hey , we want to track down the source . &quot;
i &apos;m really fortunate .
but that &apos;s only half of the story -- 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 percent of the fol@@ ding ra@@ ti@@ os produce not this , but this , the ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric equivalent of noise .
my understanding of the course is that it cover@@ s quite a lot .
what we want to do is mix in all types of data .
and it is a mar@@ vel@@ ous example of how a differ@@ ential in power can be over@@ ri@@ dden by a process of nature that &apos;s within all of us .
ph@@ thal@@ ates are horrible because they &apos;re so easily taken into our bodies .
you see the contr@@ ast between the rich and poor .
because one of the issues today is that the economic aggre@@ gate is driving the development aggre@@ gate , and as the aggre@@ g@@ ates get larger we require more and more complex investi@@ gation process@@ es to solve these problems .
the work was done success@@ fully in the field , and the data was archi@@ ved and publi@@ c@@ ly dis@@ se@@ min@@ ated through the cy@@ ar@@ k website .
for the big companies , it &apos;s re@@ pu@@ tational risk , but more importantly , they don &apos;t care what the price of com@@ modi@@ ties is .
so we can study this as a physical , intui@@ tive model .
this sou@@ p con@@ tains all the nu@@ cle@@ i that once were a mouse brain .
these micro@@ -@@ machines , which are the en@@ vy of nanot@@ echn@@ ologists the world over , are self-@@ dire@@ cted , powerful , precise , accurate devices that are made out of str@@ ings of amin@@ o acids .

it may surprise you that it &apos;s not only climate .
we &apos;re a free society , so we let por@@ no@@ graphy and all these things -- we s@@ hr@@ u@@ g them off .
here &apos;s charles when he was three . so he would be 100 this jun@@ e .
so when you start -- and we cannot be so pre@@ pot@@ ent on having all the answers -- it &apos;s important starting and having the contribu@@ tion from people , and they could teach you if you &apos;re not in the right track .

russia is using wi@@ k@@ is to get citizens writing law together , as is li@@ th@@ u@@ ania . when we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending , leg@@ is@@ lation , decisi@@ on-@@ making — then we &apos;re well on our way to an open government revolution .
well , i &apos;m not even going to address the clearly ir@@ rational posi@@ tions of people like the ca@@ tho@@ li@@ c church , who think somehow that if you give out con@@ dom@@ s , everyone &apos;s going to run out and have sex .
but then there are a series of things : aids , he@@ pati@@ tis , malaria , t@@ b , others and sim@@ pl@@ er ones , such as gui@@ dance of treatment .

this is a picture of me from a very aw@@ k@@ ward stage in my life .
so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
i know , because i &apos;ve intervie@@ wed about 1,000 lot@@ tery bu@@ yers over the years .
we did see a bunch of people , a lot of them missing a lot of body parts , and parts they had left were bur@@ ned ; half a face gone , an e@@ ar bur@@ ned off .

the ability to u@@ tili@@ ze that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depen@@ ds on your internal capacity .

and if you find one , i will say that this is something related to se@@ ti , because naturally you can &apos;t do it .
and we were helped by the market in@@ effici@@ ency .
it was beautiful . they li@@ f@@ ted me into the co@@ ck@@ p@@ it .

so he &apos;s going like this .
it &apos;s a medical story , but more than that , it &apos;s a social story .
we talk about ourselves as om@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do .
invest in education .
we &apos;re pur@@ pos@@ ely not sig@@ ning anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones .

you &apos;ll change your smart@@ phone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .

you can imagine that , for the entire country of z@@ ambi@@ a , ans@@ wer@@ ing just that single question looks something like this .
second of all , i &apos;m going to recom@@ men@@ d that you get into a pro@@ active stance and write to your elec@@ ted offi@@ ci@@ als at least once a month .
and they want to do their design by simu@@ lation .
and being aware is just about remem@@ ber@@ ing that you saw everything you &apos;ve seen for the first time once , too .
you might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
all of these solutions deri@@ ve their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpre@@ ter and a trans@@ l@@ ator .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical fir@@ ing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extra@@ ct the motor messa@@ ges that are embedded in it , translate it into digital comm@@ ands and send it to an arti@@ ficial device that will re@@ produce the volun@@ tary motor whe@@ el of that brain in real time .
there &apos;s ar@@ men@@ ian , russi@@ an , french , english , itali@@ an .

i need more light .
this is an absol@@ ute mira@@ cle , much harder to explain than the grand canyon .
well , i do .
moving to the other end of the scale , our ancestors never had to navi@@ gate through the cos@@ mos at spee@@ ds close to the speed of light . if they had , our brains would be much better at understanding einstein . i want to give the name &quot; middle world &quot; to the medi@@ um-@@ sc@@ aled environment in which we &apos;ve evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with middle earth .
that &apos;s what they see every day .
storm tro@@ oper co@@ st@@ um@@ es . m@@ aps of middle earth -- that &apos;s one i hand-@@ dre@@ w myself . there &apos;s the do@@ do skelet@@ on fol@@ der .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have ac@@ tors that really feel very inter@@ active , that have real bodies that really re@@ act .
and to do that , i &apos;ll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input .
there &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
ok , now , if you did not allow me to dec@@ ei@@ ve your minds , you would all be able to do this .
so , think about your own life , the decisions that have shaped your dest@@ in@@ y .
now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one .
so , you know , when a school bus is blo@@ wn up and we &apos;ve never seen this before , our general tendency is to ori@@ ent towards that which is new and no@@ vel is activ@@ ated .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quanti@@ fy it , so to measure the distance that a single v@@ ine m@@ ap@@ le tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measu@@ red and su@@ mm@@ ed each of those lines .
and as a result of the associ@@ ation , i &apos;m now a director of the m@@ ell@@ on financial corpor@@ ation that bought dre@@ y@@ f@@ us .
under that theory , we are the be@@ -@@ all and en@@ d-@@ all of all creation .
actually , it &apos;s all just an idea .
it was due to a russi@@ an mathematical physicist , and it was a complicated theory .
text : you can say a jury is cor@@ rupt .
and that &apos;s an ou@@ trage@@ ous and ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous finding , but it &apos;s true .
can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , i need the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , i need the key@@ board , of how this actually works .
because if architecture is what i believe it to be , which is the built form of our cultural ambi@@ tions , what do you do when pres@@ ented with an opportunity to rec@@ ti@@ fy a situation that represents somebody else &apos;s cultural ambi@@ tions rela@@ tive to us ?
but over here , the heads of the d@@ fs , mr. r@@ .c. shar@@ man , mr. a.@@ k. shar@@ man , led the fire@@ fight with their men .

so , that was , fair to say , an aston@@ ishing talk .
the fact is that , if i tried and it didn &apos;t work , then i could make a statement about how un@@ willing the global community is to uni@@ te -- until , it was in somalia , pi@@ cking up that young girl .
and here comes dun@@ e-@@ scape , coming up out of the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and there it is fully built .
now check this out .
and there was this person , mu@@ ri@@ el co@@ oper .
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have .
and this is continu@@ ing and continu@@ ing and continu@@ ing .
hold still , you &apos;re the scale .
it &apos;s pretty clean . if you &apos;re healthy , you &apos;re pretty healthy .
others will talk about intellectual achie@@ v@@ ements in discipl@@ ines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world , and other fol@@ k will talk about peri@@ ods when there was a deep fl@@ ourishing of the arts and sci@@ ences . so this debate will go on and on .
now that is true . that is what home@@ op@@ a@@ thy is all about .
one was -- never be late . never be late .
but my eleph@@ ant in the living room flies .
this is the guys on the rop@@ e , pul@@ ling open the car@@ c@@ ass .

to be serious .
if one looks car@@ efully , on the con@@ go river is one of those bright lights . and that &apos;s the very con@@ go river gener@@ ating light -- the old heart of dar@@ k@@ ness now gener@@ ating light with hydro@@ -@@ electric power .

and this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the col@@ on@@ ies , or we estimate we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the col@@ on@@ ies over the winter .
and we saw about 35 alter@@ nations between open water and ic@@ e-@@ covered water , between gra@@ vels and these plant se@@ di@@ ments .
so it looks a little bit like this .
in other words , that risk on the quar@@ ter acre needed to be re@@ paid in a single har@@ v@@ est , or else they wouldn &apos;t take the risk .
so initi@@ ally , when we started our research , we went and met several ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives , and we asked them , &quot; what do you think ? will india go from being a favor@@ ed dest@@ ination for software services and back office services to a dest@@ ination for innovation ? &quot;
now everybody agre@@ es that thy@@ ro@@ id can@@ c@@ ers are sky high , and that cher@@ no@@ by@@ l ev@@ acu@@ e@@ es suff@@ er the trau@@ ma of rel@@ oc@@ ated peop@@ les everywhere : higher levels of an@@ xiety , depression , alco@@ holi@@ sm , un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and , importantly , dis@@ rup@@ ted social networks .
the poor@@ est and most back@@ ward societies are always those that put women down .
this is where we conc@@ ei@@ ve of r@@ ape and cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties as ine@@ vit@@ abilities .
well , guess what ? in england , it &apos;s seven per 100,000 .
now , there &apos;s over 4,000 rab@@ bits across the united states and 5,000 more on the waiting list .
that is to say , if something happened -- and i &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen , but i &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
we each have a self , but i don &apos;t think that we &apos;re born with one .
well in terms of -- if you were in and@@ hr@@ a pra@@ des@@ h , you would make this with the pal@@ my@@ ra lea@@ f .
i discovered a couple of years later that this process that i had gone through is called by psychologists &quot; doing a life re@@ view . &quot;
ok , excell@@ ent . open your eyes .
and i &apos;m going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something .
and things can happen only if these inter@@ actions are perfectly balan@@ ced .
im : oh , it &apos;s so fab@@ ul@@ ous !
and if it &apos;s the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic . thank you very much .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
so trying to co@@ ok , ans@@ wer@@ ing the phone , writing sms , and maybe up@@ lo@@ ading some pictures about this awesome bar@@ bec@@ ue .
and for that reason , poli@@ o er@@ adi@@ cation : it &apos;s the ultimate in equ@@ ity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justice .
now , at the out@@ set , i want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judg@@ ments .
all over the world . and that company was the big german electronics giant sie@@ men@@ s .
&quot; as the last do@@ do was dying , spin@@ o@@ za was looking for a rational explanation for everything , called eu@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ ia .
the only thing that they can &apos;t copy is the actual tra@@ de@@ mark lab@@ el within that piece of appar@@ el .
there &apos;s going to have to be a l@@ essen@@ ing of the amount of hat@@ red in the world , given how dangerous it &apos;s becoming .
and i had lun@@ ch with her yesterday because she &apos;s a college student studying dance at long beach here , and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
now , eventually , one did . under the conditions of an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , and 1,@@ 500 dollars per seat that we crash@@ ed .
in the pres@@ ence of god , there is no room for more than one &quot; i , &quot; and that is the &quot; i &quot; of di@@ vin@@ ity .
but only 30 percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago .
and not everybody on death row was a political prison@@ er .
you then have to introduce the mos@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es , and you have to model that and how they come and go .
here &apos;s the carto@@ on on the left there .
they &apos;ve got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level .
can you be not for or against anything ?
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , swe@@ den and japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sorts of ways .
okay , so when that happens everything lines up .
so the thing is , this kind of idea of chines@@ e-@@ american food doesn &apos;t exist only in america .
and the second go@@ at says , &quot; no , the book was better . &quot;
now that doesn &apos;t sound like a lot , but it &apos;s very important , because being able to deli@@ ver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it sim@@ pl@@ er for us to cer@@ ti@@ fy it , but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only p@@ ad@@ dy fields , and since we invi@@ ted him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
i &apos;ll do 5@@ 7@@ ,000 squ@@ ared , plus 6@@ 83 squ@@ ared , plus 5@@ 7@@ ,000 times 6@@ 83 times two .
that &apos;s the real question , because this is something that &apos;s been there , part of every society that &apos;s de@@ pri@@ ved of enough resources .
which is , again , a sense that it &apos;s all new .
we went in and sat down at the boot@@ h , and the wa@@ it@@ ress came over , made a big com@@ motion over ti@@ pp@@ er .
don &apos;t st@@ ack them up , ok .
the other thing that &apos;s worth consi@@ der@@ ing is that we &apos;ve made a huge investment over decades and decades , and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our in@@ her@@ it@@ ance .
and as a result of that , mil@@ dre@@ d is very typical of today &apos;s fac@@ tory workers in the u.s .
but the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the plan@@ es west of the miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i were gro@@ unded because a single rou@@ ting card in salt lake city had a bug in it .
on the other hand , i had played the viol@@ in my entire life .
extra@@ ordin@@ arily dama@@ ging , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population .
but they asked one question . they said , &quot; is this repe@@ at@@ able ? &quot;
the first author is blackaw@@ ton primary school , because if it were ever refer@@ enced , it would be &quot; blackaw@@ ton et al , &quot; and not one individual . so we sub@@ mit it to a public access journ@@ al , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
but in 2008 , there isn &apos;t one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear de@@ ton@@ ation disaster .
so what you &apos;re doing is compar@@ ing that ang@@ le instead of with this one , but with that one .
ra patients , as they call themselves -- her blog is ra war@@ ri@@ or -- have a big problem because 40 percent of them have no visible symp@@ tom@@ s .
but movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
we can do the same for geo@@ ther@@ mal energy and solar power .
we &apos;re here , none of us fear the ro@@ of is going to collap@@ se on us , not because we che@@ cked , but because we &apos;re pretty sure the building co@@ des here are good .
you know , she e@@ ats small por@@ tions .
the six@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders look at it and they say , &quot; no . &quot;
many people tell me that you are a photo@@ journal@@ ist , that you are an anthrop@@ ologist photo@@ grapher , that you are an activ@@ ist photo@@ grapher .
but we can also store energy using super@@ condu@@ ctors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation .
i worked with other scientists to analy@@ ze earth climate obser@@ va@@ tions .
but what a liber@@ ating thing to realize that our problems , in fact , are probably our rich@@ est sour@@ ces for ris@@ ing to this ultimate virtu@@ e of compassion , towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and jo@@ ys of others .
so these articles were saying , you know , &quot; skelet@@ al -- me@@ tast@@ as@@ is to skelet@@ al mus@@ cle -- is very rare . &quot;
that &apos;s a hopeful message , but it &apos;s a message that &apos;s hopeful only if you understand it as in@@ curr@@ ing serious obli@@ gation for all of us .
we have got to make sure that we can move our econom@@ ies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
ok , so when we did this research , we found the absolutely , 100 percent , gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed way to never forget anything ever , ever again .
if you kill innovation in fund@@ rais@@ ing , you can &apos;t raise more re@@ venue .
so he put the pen down .
we have strong sk@@ ull bones that protect the most important organ in our body : the brain .
she said that a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people could change the world .
but you &apos;ll notice the level of exc@@ it@@ ement .
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they &apos;re going to be using as role models .
the challenge there with a brea@@ thing and a@@ wake patient -- and in all our treatments , the patient is a@@ wake and consci@@ ous and spea@@ ks with the physi@@ cian -- is you have to teach the m@@ r some tricks how to do it in real time .
they just knew like , hey , they were going to build calcul@@ ators and traffic light controll@@ ers . but it &apos;s going to be big .
do they have transpor@@ tation to the phar@@ ma@@ cy ?
but let me just try a couple .
this is the reality that we deal with .
why don &apos;t they just keep on going ?
so i was almost ready to give up when one night i played around with these sent@@ ences and found out that there &apos;s actually a beautiful solution in here .
they say , &quot; let &apos;s question auth@@ ority . &quot;
let &apos;s just start by looking at some great photograph@@ s .
now , this is not only about numbers ; this is not only about the fact that we &apos;re seven billion people commit@@ ted to nine billion people , it &apos;s an equ@@ ity issue as well .
they hu@@ g@@ ged .
bad enough we had to see j@@ . ed@@ gar ho@@ over in a d@@ ress .
the skin had to be absolutely accurate .
a poor person , a low-@@ income person , somebody in &quot; cancer alle@@ y , &quot; somebody in watts , somebody in har@@ lem , somebody on an indian reser@@ vation , might say to themselves , and ri@@ ght@@ fully so , &quot; how can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life , and yet , when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison , he doesn &apos;t get a second chance ? &quot;
there was even a little sop@@ ran@@ o sol@@ o in the piece , and so i had audi@@ tions .
how do we try to understand what china is ?
and i had a chance to do that , when national geo@@ graphic asked me if i wanted to write anything about china .
and i kind of went over@@ board on the week after the project was over .
be a dis@@ cer@@ ning consumer .
in mol@@ do@@ va , despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis , the numbers of children in institutions has redu@@ ced by more than 50 percent in the last five years , and the resources are being re@@ distribu@@ ted to family support services and inclu@@ sive schools .
we can design better games .
as you can see , it has world class art , and it &apos;s all my taste because i raised all the money .
if we watch the next clip , you &apos;re going to see the first version of &quot; power@@ s of ten , &quot; upper left .
the roots and sho@@ ots groups all choose three projects .
and what we &apos;re saying is that , shouldn &apos;t our cities do at least as well , in terms of ecosystem services , as the native systems that they replace ?
and then i was sort of making ima@@ gery .
this is a big joke .
and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we &apos;ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
the ban@@ ks -- these ban@@ ks are now con@@ soli@@ dated , and that str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening of the ban@@ king system has attra@@ cted a lot of investment from outside .
in sand@@ paper , bone gl@@ ue is actually the gl@@ ue between the sand and the paper .
they always have . they always will .
there &apos;s a possibility of this being imple@@ ment@@ ed and saving a good por@@ tion of those .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
and then they said to half the physi@@ cians , they said , &quot; yesterday you re@@ vie@@ wed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you for@@ got to try one medi@@ cation .
and he said , &quot; well , okay . &quot;
my first experience with king co@@ br@@ as was in &apos; 72 at a ma@@ gi@@ cal place called a@@ gu@@ m@@ be , in kar@@ nat@@ aka , this state .
no . but is it fun ?
to@@ i@@ let fac@@ ili@@ ties : very bad .
cities are places of cele@@ bra@@ tion , personal expression .
no one has to speak to me .
even the sli@@ gh@@ test hin@@ t of color on the under@@ bel@@ ly of a clou@@ d would in@@ form them and help them navi@@ gate with the ke@@ en@@ est accur@@ acy .
str@@ ings atta@@ ched to dan@@ c@@ ers .
and the truth is i don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
and j@@ ill and k@@ ev@@ in , the happy couple , they came back from their hon@@ ey@@ moon and found that their video had gone crazy vi@@ ral .
and we are ab@@ using this great power we have to be wise ste@@ wards , and we &apos;re destro@@ ying the world .
his name is chris far@@ ina .

we can choose to take time back .
let &apos;s go to the clos@@ est neigh@@ bor to the visible light spectrum -- go to remote contro@@ ls .
so if you be@@ at your wife , you &apos;re going to be there .
another great example is fi@@ del@@ ity .
i have to think like an exist@@ enti@@ al@@ ist .
they resi@@ sted environmental impro@@ vement .

man . i don &apos;t really need to com@@ ment on this .
she said that when she just ran it across the table , it felt like her finger was ro@@ cking .
i used to clim@@ b trees for fun all the time and now , as a grow@@ n@@ -up , i have made my prof@@ ession understanding trees and forests , through the medium of science .
dogs get so ab@@ used .
and in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals .
but then a big difference happened about 50 years ago , after sputnik was launched . we launched the first american satelli@@ te , and that &apos;s the one you see on the left in there .
look at it . it &apos;s constantly doing this .
we &apos;ve tried to build in re@@ tri@@ ev@@ al practice into the platform , as well as other forms of practice in many ways .
what happens if one of the eng@@ ines stops ?
the first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments .
and it &apos;s not a whole lot different , really , when they &apos;re working like this , or when somebody works like this .
and then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3-@@ page crisis docum@@ ent with 50 inter@@ lo@@ cking problems .
the worst er@@ as in human history , whether in cam@@ bo@@ dia or ger@@ many or r@@ wand@@ a , they start like this , with negative other@@ -@@ i@@ zing .
they had people involved who were no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates in economics , who repor@@ ted being bor@@ ed .
i asked everybody , more or less , to put their docum@@ ents -- i said , &quot; could you put your docum@@ ents on this web thing ? &quot;
cir@@ c@@ us , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , dr@@ ama .
and she said , &quot; well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . &quot;
and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplom@@ at .
you &apos;ve got the re@@ d-@@ hat tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes over there .
we gave them our email address , suggesting that , if they write us , we &apos;ll send them a free molecule .
one of them is mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king &apos;s &quot; i have a dream , &quot; and the other one is hit@@ ler .
really cool term : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y -- the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in adul@@ ts .
so tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means .
did you notice this section is fore@@ play ?
let me point out some that i really like .
so if we zo@@ om in to an even deeper level , all of those proteins are en@@ co@@ ded by our genom@@ es .
i didn &apos;t grow up in the slums or anything that di@@ re , but i know what it is to grow up without having money , or being able to support family .
now , doing this is easier said than done .
but slowly it began to da@@ wn on me that something rather special was happening .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
you all probably intended to wake up , i don &apos;t know , 6 : 30 , 7 a.@@ m .
gre@@ g stone : saving the ocean one island at a time
kids in the 12@@ th grade : not exactly all that enthusi@@ astic about the american government system .
i would like to kind of zo@@ om in on the moon .
i think that in order to address that question , we have to step back and think about how we &apos;ve understood and pon@@ dered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face .
and for those of you who are not parents , si@@ pp@@ y cu@@ ps are those little plastic things that your child gradu@@ ates to after using bott@@ les .

in that we &apos;re unique , and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine .
and it has to be free .
so just keep looking . don &apos;t mind me .
didn &apos;t you feel any p@@ ity for your victi@@ ms ?
anyway , so we rel@@ ease this report in ju@@ ly last year .
or an aes@@ thetic experience -- a sun@@ set or a great piece of art .
you see , they were having trouble in this flight regi@@ me , and it wasn &apos;t at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
but it was a little bit boring .
of course , how would you em@@ power citizens ?
many of the people living in countries not their own are refuge@@ es who never wanted to leave home and a@@ che to go back home .
it &apos;s not that easy !
and at a gather@@ ing of pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous american mathemati@@ cians , he walked to the board , took up a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , and started writing out the power@@ s of two : two , four , eight , 16 -- come on , join in with me , you know how it goes -- 3@@ 2 , 64 , 12@@ 8 , 2@@ 5@@ 6 , 5@@ 12 , 1,@@ 0@@ 24 , 2,@@ 0@@ 48 .
and we also found bacteria that norm@@ ally in@@ hab@@ it the gut .
you can see there the wings fol@@ ded up just along the side of the plane .
and one of the major things we can do we &apos;ve talked a bit about here today is moving the cur@@ ve to the left .
open your hand . thank you very much .
when i was in college my sen@@ ior year , i took a course called european intellectual history .
i photograph@@ ed this thing last week in dor@@ set .
it is in giving our lives away that we find meaning , we find significance .
and i knew how mr. web@@ ster defin@@ ed it : as the ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of material pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons or the at@@ tainment of a position of power or pre@@ stige , or something of that sort -- wor@@ thy ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indi@@ ca@@ tive of success .
he hasn &apos;t been able to s@@ have -- a sort of bil@@ ly con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly figure .
it &apos;s white , black , h@@ is@@ p@@ anic , asi@@ an .

my left leg got caught up in the whe@@ el well -- sp@@ un it around .
it may be the next rain@@ forest , in terms of phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als .
most people live as if they &apos;re never going to die .
i first saw this in a can@@ adi@@ an film board film when i was 10 , and it left a la@@ sting im@@ pres@@ sion , to see babies playing with kni@@ ves .
and we will be trying to bring the par@@ ties to new york to sit down in a quie@@ t room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u@@ . n. security coun@@ cil , and for the members of the u.n. security coun@@ cil to explain to them what they want .
my kni@@ fe became a little shar@@ per .
sometimes quite fres@@ h@@ ly fl@@ oral , and then again sometimes extremely p@@ ung@@ ent . &quot;
we dropped a probe in the atmosphere of titan .
this is a new cha@@ ir which should come on the market in september .
of course , none of them liked it .
dar@@ ling . beautiful stuff .
but no one ever consi@@ dered that they might be more clos@@ ely related .
so you can imagine , if you are in the middle of a ten@@ se cab@@ in@@ et meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to rela@@ x .
it was the continu@@ ing de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing war in the con@@ go and the in@@ difference of the world .
as the frequ@@ en@@ cies increase , so do the comple@@ xi@@ ties of the patterns that appear on the pla@@ te .
and those t@@ win revolu@@ tions in electricity will bring to that sector more nu@@ mer@@ ous and profound and di@@ verse dis@@ rup@@ tions than any other sector , because we &apos;ve got 21@@ st century technology and speed colli@@ ding head-@@ on with 20@@ th and 19@@ th century institutions , rules and cultures .
are they going to find their skills , their enthusi@@ as@@ m , and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the re@@ form , or will they just stay complaining about the end@@ less list of the things they ha@@ te ?
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
until then , cancer was the zo@@ dia@@ c sign of my friend , stage was what i per@@ formed on , and gra@@ des were what i got in school .
we visit ki@@ b@@ bu@@ tz@@ im that were establi@@ shed by h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st survi@@ vor@@ s .
20 years ago , a new generation of anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects .
and had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a victi@@ m of their dis@@ crimin@@ ation ?
h@@ ill@@ ary &apos;s completely gone .
and this is it .
read mon@@ ta@@ gue : what we &apos;re learning from 5,000 brains
many people think , &quot; well , it &apos;s computers , and it &apos;s done by machines and stuff like that . &quot;
and per@@ chance , if you can always keep this picture in your mind , that when we conven@@ e maybe in the dist@@ ant future , in 2020 , that picture will look very different .
you &apos;re having a heart attack . what are you going to do ?
so just 12 cities . she was born in man@@ chester , england , the n@@ in@@ th largest city in the world .
in some of the other amazing ca@@ ves that we work in -- this is in le@@ ch@@ ugu@@ ill@@ a ca@@ ve in new mexico near car@@ l@@ s@@ bad , and this is one of the most famous ca@@ ves in the world .
and yet we &apos;re spending billions of s@@ wis@@ s fran@@ cs on this problem .
so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hir@@ ing , training and pa@@ ying blog@@ gers in order to leave ide@@ ological comm@@ ents and create a lot of ide@@ ological blog po@@ sts to com@@ ment on sensitive political issues . right ?
and so i went back and i studied my first two acts , trying to see who i was then , who i really was -- not who my parents or other people told me i was , or treated me like i was .
i had to focus all my energi@@ es towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral re@@ ef@@ s .
it looked at the inter@@ section of race and gender in con@@ temporary american art .
here is one example . this is a train which goes from london to paris .
i hope you enjo@@ yed mathema@@ gi@@ cs . thank you .
can we use , in a way , a body as an empty cat@@ aly@@ st for a kind of em@@ pathy with the experience of spac@@ e-@@ time as it is lived , as i am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this spac@@ e-@@ time that we are sharing , can we use , at it were , the memory of a body , of a human space in space to cat@@ aly@@ ze an experience , again , fir@@ sth@@ and experience , of element@@ al time .
let &apos;s look at some of the m@@ aps being created by users right now .
raise an ar@@ my when you need it , and main@@ tain a na@@ vy for da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day connec@@ tivity .
again , the thing that &apos;s incredible about this is this is how advan@@ ced these devices have become .
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chron@@ ic@@ les a journey .
are you going to hu@@ g a tree , or are you going to hu@@ g a child ? pick . &quot;
in new or@@ le@@ ans , the el@@ der@@ ly and fe@@ mal@@ e-@@ headed house@@ holds were among the most vulnerable .
we &apos;ve evolved to get all excited about these drama@@ tic attac@@ ks . is that because in the past , in the an@@ cient past , we just didn &apos;t understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth , and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things ?
although five is a good number , of course .
to@@ y@@ ot@@ a , instead of treating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a mark@@ et@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
and in fact , the reme@@ dy for wo@@ unded and mu@@ til@@ ated urban@@ ism is good urban@@ ism , good buildings .
and what you see is that the film on the bottom rel@@ eas@@ es what is inside it .
ok , so why is the problem acceler@@ ating ? part of the problem is , iron@@ ically , because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use .
they say , &quot; i have to give one up ? &quot;
so what happens during the second world war ?
but there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you -- give us all a tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , a way of thinking about it .
i would set boun@@ dar@@ ies for the voices , and try to interact with them in a way that was ass@@ er@@ tive yet respe@@ c@@ t@@ ful , establi@@ sh@@ ing a slow process of communication and collabor@@ ation in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
what we do , my students in my lab and i , is we buy bar@@ bi@@ es from goo@@ d@@ will and value village , we d@@ ress her in clothes that have been made by se@@ am@@ st@@ res@@ ses and we send her out with a can@@ op@@ y hand@@ book .
in my dre@@ ams i fan@@ t@@ asi@@ ze of w@@ rea@@ king ven@@ ge@@ ance on you guys .
in other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-@@ adol@@ escence , whereas in contr@@ ast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there &apos;s still a significant impro@@ vement in the director condition between mid-@@ adol@@ escence and adul@@ tho@@ od , and what this means is that the ability to take into accoun@@ t someone else &apos;s perspective in order to gui@@ de on@@ going behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-@@ to-@@ late adol@@ escence .
and this is a challenge .
sure you were , because you &apos;ve prepar@@ ed your entire life for this histor@@ ic quad@@ ren@@ ni@@ al event that just sort of s@@ ne@@ a@@ ks up on you .
and a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people changed that bay .
i &apos;m going to give you po@@ em called &quot; forced to sin , &quot; which is from my al@@ bu@@ m &quot; war child . &quot;
and it works , not just for my wife , but certainly for other patients .
this is powered by low-@@ cost v@@ sat technology , aggressi@@ vely trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .
one of the reasons , i think , is a sort of bo@@ iled fro@@ g phenomenon .
and you &apos;re pretty rich by the standards of the world at large .
here are two very different walls , very different ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric pictures .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good op@@ pon@@ ent , they may distribu@@ te it in that green area , which is the pri@@ or distribution , making it hard for you to return .
where you can pe@@ e on a little chip connected to your iphone and check yourself for an st@@ d .
and it turns the mouse into mi@@ gh@@ ty mouse -- it makes it fe@@ ar@@ less , so it r@@ uns out in the open , where it &apos;ll be e@@ aten by a cat .
we love things like p@@ lot twi@@ sts and red herr@@ ings and surprise end@@ ings .
and it &apos;s an idea that i think is very pre@@ valent at these ted talks , the idea that we can inv@@ ent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis , that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow ne@@ at@@ ly si@@ de@@ step those energy constra@@ in@@ ts , the idea that we &apos;ll discover some fab@@ ul@@ ous new source of energy that will mean we can swe@@ ep all concer@@ ns about energy security to one side , the idea that we can step off ne@@ at@@ ly onto a completely ren@@ e@@ w@@ able world .
bas@@ h@@ o was a brilliant man .
and again , i kept on going , looking for more re@@ ference , every bit of re@@ ference i could find -- drawings , beautiful photos .
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s already , through the green revolution and the hab@@ er-@@ bos@@ ch process of fi@@ x@@ ing ni@@ trogen from the atmosphere -- you know , human &apos;s today take out more ni@@ trogen from the atmosphere than the whole bios@@ phere does naturally as a whole .
a play@@ station ii is in the works , maybe for the next ted i &apos;ll bring it .
and how are we going to get those kids those nutri@@ tious fo@@ ods ?
so a rational choice economist would say , well , you should take all non-@@ zero offers .
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spac@@ es@@ hip@@ one is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright fl@@ yer .
india is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic divi@@ den@@ d for the next 30 years .
just so you don &apos;t embar@@ r@@ ass y@@ ourselves , i &apos;ll give you the right answer : it &apos;s increase .
mon@@ terey is one of the few places in the world where mol@@ as come in large numbers .
so , in true web fashion they put together a pol@@ l where they had a bunch of very er@@ u@@ di@@ te , very thou@@ ght@@ ful , cul@@ tured names .
so , this small machine that you &apos;ve seen , we &apos;re hop@@ ing to make small toys like one-@@ meter remote control prote@@ i that you can up@@ grade -- so replace the remote control parts by andro@@ ids , so the mobile phone , and ar@@ du@@ in@@ o micro@@ -@@ controll@@ er , so you could be controll@@ ing this from your mobile phone , your tab@@ let .
all of us in our 6@@ 0s and 7@@ 0s have compar@@ able depres@@ sing stories .
on ju@@ ly 7@@ th , 200@@ 9 , benjam@@ í@@ n le bar@@ ó@@ n was mur@@ dered .
so there &apos;s another thing that comes up with bas@@ ics .
the auth@@ orities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could ta@@ x people and make more money for to run their business .
there &apos;s the hea@@ v@@ y-@@ hit@@ ting sound of rock .
and so light sh@@ one upon the dark ages of europe .
and just for fun , we put a bunch of technologies on it , to show whether they were kind of ris@@ ing for the first high pe@@ ak , or whether they were about to crash into the tr@@ ough of dis@@ illu@@ si@@ on@@ ment , or rise back in the slo@@ pe of en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , etc .
&quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ huh ... &quot; she said .
and we found that over 500 genes were favor@@ ably changed -- in effect , turning on the good genes , the diseas@@ e-@@ pre@@ vent@@ ing genes , turning off the diseas@@ e-@@ pro@@ mot@@ ing genes .
and in place of that , what happens is that islam@@ ism gro@@ ws as an ide@@ ology which is auth@@ or@@ it@@ arian , which is quite stri@@ dent , which is quite anti-@@ western , and which wants to shape society based on a ut@@ op@@ ian vision .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never re@@ turns to its original shape .
and , it would arri@@ ve at an agre@@ ement that everybody was happy with , without having to manipu@@ late them so much -- which is basically what i do , i manipu@@ late them .
maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
they have hero@@ in addi@@ ction and also prostit@@ ution in iran .
from medical research , space explor@@ ation , where i work , at c@@ ern in gen@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engineering , even arts and human@@ i@@ ties , fund@@ ed from the science budget , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny yellow blo@@ b around the or@@ ange blo@@ b at the top left of the screen .
mar@@ c@@ us : with an ak@@ -@@ 47 ?
i &apos;m going to talk about why we are so f@@ at@@ ali@@ stic about doing anything about aging .
i &apos;ll give you one last illu@@ stra@@ tion of vari@@ ability , and that is -- oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it means , &quot; return and get it . &quot; learn from the past .
let &apos;s fa@@ st-@@ forward to the san francisco bay area many decades later , where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d laser scanning system .
why don &apos;t you say , &quot; listen , let me tell you a story &quot; ?
and so for those who are un@@ da@@ un@@ ted , but hum@@ bl@@ ed by the complexity of the brain , the future a@@ wa@@ its .
and it does this bur@@ st of energy .
we s@@ ang , we s@@ ang , we s@@ ang , and ama@@ zingly new trust grew , and indeed friend@@ ship bl@@ os@@ som@@ ed .
it &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pre@@ ten@@ ds it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
rel@@ eas@@ ed it on the streets of manhattan .
gen@@ es@@ is : chap@@ ter one , verse &#91; 29 &#93; , where god talks about le@@ gu@@ mes and see@@ ds , and on one more stan@@ za about green plants , o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly missing is meat .
a black hole does not make a kind neigh@@ bor to a st@@ el@@ lar nur@@ ser@@ y .
so essentially , the three things that are required to make this con@@ version from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today , some parts from a computer mouse , basically , something that you can sc@@ a@@ ven@@ ge for very low cost , and a few parts that have to be pre-@@ program@@ med .
tables and cha@@ irs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ anic skin response is fl@@ at .
people after the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in new ze@@ al@@ and vis@@ ited us in order to in@@ corporate some of this public spi@@ ri@@ te@@ dness around local growing into the heart of christ@@ church .
and i don &apos;t know whether they actually saw cra@@ b in it , or imag@@ ined that one might be , but whatever the case , they would lea@@ p off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head , and then the web between the arms would completely eng@@ ulf the coral head , and they would fish out , swim for cr@@ ab@@ s .
for the next dem@@ o , i &apos;d like you to introduce to my colleagues michael , on the computer , and th@@ om@@ as who &apos;s helping me on@@ stage .
like it . find other books exactly like his .
this is for a book by &quot; me@@ tro@@ poli@@ s . &quot;
because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly . i mean , if you look at the 18@@ 49 gold r@@ ush -- the entire american river region , within two years -- every stone had been turned . and after that , only big companies who used more sop@@ hi@@ sticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there .
and one of the ways we deal with it is we num@@ b vulner@@ ability .
it &apos;s an insu@@ lt to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
and what &apos;s been taking up the sl@@ ack in the last few decades ?
the solution to all of this is pretty easy .
the days of pil@@ ot projects are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works . &quot;
do you know these books , these such and such &quot; for dum@@ mi@@ es ? &quot;
this woman told me it was in the ni@@ ck of time .
if i look at my own life , i &apos;m born in 196@@ 2 in au@@ stri@@ a .
and that directly increased student well@@ being .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copyright mathemati@@ cians who are media lo@@ b@@ by exper@@ ts are mer@@ ely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get com@@ po@@ unded for in@@ f@@ lation every year .
they just have to raise their hands .
all right . mi@@ ke , thanks so much .
they &apos;re actually looking at them down in that world .
we are not alone in these abilities .
the project came back to us about a decade later , and this time with a director named david fin@@ cher .
you can look at medical care . i mean , hy@@ gi@@ ene , vacc@@ ines , anti@@ bio@@ tics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
we &apos;re all cho@@ king , and there &apos;s smo@@ ke p@@ our@@ ing through the v@@ ents , under the do@@ ors . there &apos;s people scre@@ aming .
so what we &apos;re really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain , but we can also measure the difference in magne@@ tic proper@@ ties of blood that &apos;s oxy@@ gen@@ ated and blood that &apos;s de@@ ple@@ ted of oxygen .
i &apos;m suffering from g@@ aller@@ y fa@@ ti@@ gue .
but here &apos;s the problem : sometimes patients become resi@@ st@@ ant to the drug , and then years after they &apos;ve been decl@@ ared to be cancer free , they come back .
and this attra@@ cts met@@ als from their local environment .
folks like ann c@@ ot@@ ton , who started a group called cam@@ fed in africa , because she felt girls &apos; education was la@@ g@@ ging .
thank you .
i actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today .
so it &apos;s a joke against myself .
this is a song that came out of that .
ade@@ w@@ ale ta@@ i@@ wo , aka fe@@ dd@@ y@@ b@@ b -- master bank accoun@@ t cra@@ cker from ab@@ u@@ ja in nigeria .
so i was like , &quot; okay . this guy &apos;s at least resour@@ ce@@ ful . &quot;
see , we &apos;re a secret clu@@ b with a secret hand@@ sha@@ ke .
from this to here , that , it &apos;s genius .
are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
i even asked my class@@ mates to spend less money on coffee and ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes , but to sp@@ ons@@ or my school project .
there might be some way of treating that as true .
he made 1@@ 5,000 dollars c@@ ash and bought the house that i grew up in .
and that c@@ res@@ cent there is the moon en@@ cel@@ adu@@ s , which is about as big as the bri@@ tish is@@ les .
so , we have now made an amazing discovery , a post-@@ do@@ c in the lab who is a physicist asked me , what do the cells do when you put them in ?
it &apos;s kind of like genom@@ ics .
this shows the power of in@@ centi@@ ves .
because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science .
i &apos;m thinking of lor@@ enz contra@@ ctions and ein@@ stein@@ ian rela@@ tivity .
so i found out the name of every official on both the kore@@ an and american side , and i photograph@@ ed them , and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done .
in fact , that is three months soli@@ d x-@@ ra@@ ying .
it seems counter@@ -@@ intui@@ tive to ad@@ ult learning , but remember , eigh@@ t-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds live in a society where most of the time they are told , don &apos;t do this , you know , don &apos;t touch the whis@@ key bottle .
people who don &apos;t have neighbor@@ s of a different race are about twice as likely to opp@@ ose inter@@ ra@@ cial marri@@ age as people who do .
and yet , on the front por@@ ch of that man &apos;s cab@@ in , i saw four fish . he had to feed his family to survive .
i wor@@ e a san@@ it@@ ary pad . i filled animal blood in a football bottle , i ti@@ ed it up here , there is a tube going into my pan@@ ties , while i &apos;m walking , while i &apos;m cy@@ cl@@ ing , i made a press , d@@ os@@ es of blood will go there .
what &apos;s extraordinary about this is not just the she@@ er number of species we &apos;re finding -- although as you can see that &apos;s pretty amazing , this is only half of what we &apos;ve found -- what &apos;s extraordinary is how quickly we find them .
and the question was , will ug@@ ly jer@@ ry and ug@@ ly tom help their respe@@ ctive , more attra@@ ctive bro@@ thers ?
and people came up and pi@@ cked up the cul@@ tur@@ ally reson@@ ant image of the fal@@ af@@ el , ate it and , you know , talked and left .
so this sc@@ en@@ ario makes predi@@ ctions .
they &apos;re hard to just get automa@@ tically .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a behavior called path integration .
this involves blue@@ prin@@ ts , industrial manufac@@ turing and construction using teams of workers .
but that co@@ sts millions of dollars .
and the words of a gang me@@ mber capture it quite nic@@ ely .
so this strategy has ser@@ ved it pretty well -- it &apos;s 2,@@ 400 years old .
many years ago i heard a mathemati@@ cian from vi@@ en@@ na , whose name was mar@@ ch@@ et@@ ti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civili@@ an society are two sin@@ us@@ o@@ ids that are kind of op@@ posed .

some time ago when i was working for the new york times , it was in the &apos; 80s , i did an article on what was then a new problem in new york -- it was hom@@ eless people on the streets .
in the computer , you have all the data going through the central process@@ ing un@@ it , and any piece of data basically has to go through that bott@@ len@@ eck , whereas in the brain , what you have is these neurons , and the data just really flo@@ ws through a network of conne@@ ctions among the neurons . there &apos;s no bott@@ len@@ eck here .

it &apos;s too much energy on a planet .

the best way to test this is to actually create a model .
there are levels . there are c. there are b. there is a .

rule number two : embra@@ ce the mess .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that &apos;s it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
and i &apos;ll expand this up .
spi@@ ders are truly global citizens .
at this moment i knew , cli@@ cking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this , that i needed to do some market research .

and the aqu@@ ari@@ um had a lot of big fish tan@@ ks but not a lot of in@@ ver@@ te@@ bra@@ te dis@@ plays , and being the spin@@ eless guy , i thought , well i &apos;ll just go out in the field and colle@@ ct these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and i built these el@@ abor@@ ate se@@ ts and put them on display .

the mat@@ ri@@ arch that they were radio tra@@ cking , after weeks of moving back and forth , in and out of the park , came to a halt outside the park .

like phili@@ p ro@@ th , who said , &quot; and yet , what are we to do about this terri@@ bly significant business of other people ?

i want to stress , you know , social organization can transc@@ end political bo@@ unds .
but then , just doing the models , i was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all brow@@ sing .
that has been achie@@ ved after two years of work .
in theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
this is from la@@ ha@@ ina , and when we &apos;re walking along a beach , we &apos;re actually walking along millions of years of biological and ge@@ ological history .

jo@@ el is a new yor@@ ker , and his studio for many years was in chel@@ sea , with a straight view down@@ town to the world trade center , and he photograph@@ ed those buildings in every sort of light .
the same thing is happening , and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being car@@ ried out without any com@@ promise , but there were com@@ promis@@ es when print hit .
for the last 50 years , we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer , not in controll@@ ing cancer .

let &apos;s go down to that dun@@ geon .
i feel that there are some things that are getting in the way .
and if you look at the list of things on the bottom , we are familiar with the arab@@ ic numbers one to 10 and so on .
even when they &apos;re thinking they &apos;re just working on prote@@ cting the environment .
what does this mean and what are we going to do ? &quot;
oh , when i was bu@@ ying the clu@@ bs , somehow the young ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er was hi@@ ding from the others .

american parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; what if ? what if ? &quot;
they said , yes , walking the course is stren@@ u@@ ous physical exer@@ cise .
there are some m@@ apping people who do use their names .
and you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
its ban@@ king sector was 10 times the g@@ dp of the rest of the economy .
this time , maybe conf@@ used or dis@@ coura@@ ged by the military disaster in somalia , the international community rema@@ ined sil@@ ent , and somewhere around 8@@ 00@@ ,000 people were s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered by their own coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men -- sometimes their own neighbor@@ s -- using farm imple@@ ments as weap@@ ons .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
i don &apos;t need to be there anymore to know and to admini@@ strate the city .
for one thing , the universe will expand for@@ ever .
i think it &apos;s important .

you can see that it got started right here .
so if we are to live in a world made of smart materials , we should know and understand them .
you can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
here &apos;s another one . this is from a game called &quot; food force , &quot; which is a game that tea@@ ches children how to run a refuge@@ e cam@@ p .
i said , &quot; oh , come on . i mean , even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 , as@@ suming they didn &apos;t die from ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ on , it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god . &quot; and they said , &quot; no . &quot;
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
so i think half of my book adv@@ ance went into s@@ uns@@ cre@@ en .
so this brain region is called the right t@@ p@@ j .
note that word &quot; cooper@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant sha@@ de of pin@@ k . &quot;

i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
which means that somehow -- consci@@ ously or not , directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly , in the short or the long term , whatever we do , whatever we hope , whatever we dream -- somehow , is related to a deep , profound des@@ ire for well-@@ being or happiness .
here &apos;s a way of transpor@@ ting water .
it &apos;s really hard to imagine a so@@ f@@ a , how it &apos;s going to look in your house .
what else do we know about the heart ?
we don &apos;t replace teachers , by the way .
this hospital is connected to a very weak power grid , one that goes down frequ@@ ently .
i &apos;ve got to keep opening box@@ es .
when al gore was vice president , his team had an idea for der@@ eg@@ ulating a significant por@@ tion of the tele@@ communic@@ ations industry .
and the first chro@@ mos@@ ome we built in 2008 -- the 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000-@@ base pa@@ ir one -- we simply assig@@ ned the names of the auth@@ ors of the chro@@ mos@@ ome into the genetic code , but it was using just amin@@ o ac@@ id single letter trans@@ lations , which leaves out certain le@@ tters of the al@@ phab@@ et .
it was central planning by ma@@ o t@@ se tung .
and these are all kids with no arti@@ stic ability , no tal@@ ent , no imagination . and we bring in the world &apos;s greatest artists -- gor@@ don parks has been there , chester hig@@ g@@ ins has been there -- and what we &apos;ve learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them .
with the sm@@ all@@ est investment in the right places , you can radi@@ cally trans@@ form the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
now , 198@@ 6 .
you can &apos;t roll a stop sign in cambridge without hit@@ ting a gradu@@ ate student .
studying the human brain changed the way i think about food .
okay .
&quot; the writing on the wall &quot; is part of our everyday language .
have a little tur@@ re@@ t there .
i &apos;ve been ama@@ zed in the last year at the incredible quality and exc@@ it@@ ement of the innova@@ tions that have come across my des@@ k .
so that , this belief in each other , kno@@ wing that without a doubt and practic@@ ing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what i believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
ta@@ y@@ l@@ or wil@@ son was 14 when he built a nuclear fu@@ sion reactor in his parents &apos; garage . now 19 , he re@@ turns to the stage to present a new take on an old top@@ ic : fission . wil@@ son , who has won bac@@ king to create a company to realize his vision , explains why he &apos;s so excited about his innovative design for small mo@@ du@@ lar fission reac@@ tors -- and why it could be the next big step in solving the global energy crisis .
and within this project , he &apos;s doing a smaller project called &quot; artists in res@@ iden@@ ce . &quot;
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sp@@ ed up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and res@@ cue somebody at that upper floor ? ok ?
and the program that i wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here , was fund@@ ed , and it involves autonom@@ ous vehi@@ cles like the one running across the base of this image .
and the bus is taken with a car@@ go@@ -@@ scanning x-@@ ray , which is the sort of machine you have on bor@@ ders , which che@@ cks for contr@@ ab@@ and and drugs and bom@@ bs and things .
and howard immediately went on the road , and he would go to con@@ fer@@ ences around the country , and he would stand up and he would say , &quot; you had been looking for the perfect pe@@ p@@ s@@ i . you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m from e@@ din@@ burgh . worse news , that &apos;s even e@@ din@@ burgh .
when i finished , i went to the it@@ ur@@ i forest for my inter@@ n@@ ship .
what happened ?
and the idea he had was to establi@@ sh a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart &apos;s content .
bre@@ w@@ ster was saying the library of con@@ gress is about tw@@ enty ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
so we walked around .
so it would seem the har@@ dest , soli@@ dest , den@@ s@@ est rock is really almost entirely empty space , broken only by tiny particles so wid@@ ely spac@@ ed they shouldn &apos;t count .
you remember that i told you , when i received the farm from my parents that was my par@@ ad@@ ise , that was the farm .
remember that good things come in thre@@ es and so do bad things .
i &apos;m going to ask you to imagine what a red@@ wood really is as a living organis@@ m .
now this image con@@ stit@@ utes a huge amount of work .
it cannot be stor@@ ed .
that is col@@ tan extra@@ ction , gold mining .
but the gray areas are where you find the complexity , it &apos;s where you find the humanity and it &apos;s where you find the truth .
we share written things , we share images , we share audio , we share video .
and i thought about it , and i said , &quot; ce@@ os often pay themselves milli@@ on-@@ dollar bon@@ uses , even when companies are los@@ ing a lot of money .
now i disc@@ ussed this with professor sim@@ on bar@@ on-@@ co@@ hen who &apos;s the professor of develop@@ mental psych@@ op@@ ath@@ ology at cambridge .
here , we &apos;re trying to visu@@ alize the air@@ flow around the wings of the mos@@ qui@@ to with little particles we &apos;re ill@@ umin@@ ating with a laser .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the ou@@ ter world is limited , temporary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
they were fres@@ h , func@@ tional , and women everywhere ad@@ ored them . a new american classi@@ c was born . &quot;
and he was a cle@@ ver man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math s@@ ats . &quot;
because i believe we have an opportunity right now .
&quot; and that &apos;s not all -- co@@ ach is coming out with a new line , 2@@ 19@@ 1 , &quot; she said . &quot; one ba@@ g will sell for 6@@ ,000 . &quot;
and the answer is , every single swe@@ dis@@ h business leader does that every single day .
20 percent of the oxygen coming from your lung@@ s , 20 percent of the blood pump@@ ed from your heart , is servi@@ cing this one organ .
here &apos;s the ad@@ vice of dy@@ l@@ an &apos;s i@@ do@@ l , woo@@ dy gu@@ thr@@ ie .
so that engineers use this time to come up with a cool pat@@ ch for code , come up with an elegant h@@ ack .
so -- oh , jack of spa@@ des .
it &apos;s my one way of getting rid of my mind , getting rid of this mind that says , &quot; hey , you know what you &apos;re doing . you know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called con@@ gen@@ ital li@@ m@@ b de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ency .
where it o@@ verl@@ aps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collabor@@ ation as a sort of way to get things done .
&quot; hab@@ i@@ bi , it &apos;s so hot . just come here for a second . say hell@@ o .
we have a lot of data , so we have a lot of power .
it isn &apos;t just about nice .
white co@@ w@@ boy hat@@ s , that was absolutely fine .
it was about 1960 .
basically this was also a major outbreak , a culture of dis@@ sent , a culture of basically non-@@ con@@ for@@ mis@@ m , which was not known before .
this brings me back to the l@@ ol@@ cats and to us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
it &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
so i started in the center with the ac@@ or@@ n for the o@@ hl@@ one indian civilization .
and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spo@@ ken@@ -@@ word artist named re@@ g e@@ . ga@@ ines , who wrote the famous po@@ em , &quot; please don &apos;t take my air j@@ or@@ dan@@ s . &quot;
a collea@@ gue of mine described it as to sh@@ ine a light in the dar@@ k@@ est cor@@ ners of the world .
that hor@@ n@@ -@@ shaped region is what we call the swe@@ et spot .
and the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
go tell facebook to figure that out !
and it &apos;s not just passi@@ ve structures , it &apos;s entire machines .
now gran@@ ted , many of those are white lies .
the answer , i think , is that they used every tool in the to@@ ol@@ box .
i &apos;ve been trying inside i know that i &apos;m in trouble by myself but every time it gets me &#91; unclear &#93; and i &apos;ve been trying to be the one that you believe in and you &apos;re the one that i want to be so sau@@ cy and you &apos;re the one i want to &#91; unclear &#93; , baby and you can do anything as long as you don &apos;t get hur@@ t along the way back if i survive , i &apos;m g@@ on@@ na tell you what is wrong because if you were &#91; unclear &#93; and i think that you &apos;re looking like a &#91; unclear &#93; i give you what i want to be and it &apos;s like , you could use as many of those things that you want .
margaret wer@@ thei@@ m : the beautiful math of coral
once upon a time in 19@@ th century ger@@ many , there was the book .

the thi@@ ck walls are great for insu@@ lation . it keeps the inter@@ ior very cool during the sum@@ mer@@ time , and warm during the w@@ inter@@ time , and the small windows were also very good because between the inter@@ ior and exter@@ ior .
so , but i didn &apos;t say . i said , . pretty close .
i had about 600 milli@@ grams of c@@ aff@@ eine , zero of alco@@ hol .
it &apos;s slow . it &apos;s anti@@ qu@@ ated . it &apos;s not using the best technology , and it &apos;s not using the best people .
i produced in du@@ bai a show for ahmed ahmed to sho@@ w@@ case his new axis special to a pac@@ ked room .
more years were added to average life expec@@ tancy in the 20@@ th century than all years added across all pri@@ or mil@@ len@@ nia of human evolution combined .
and there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater speci@@ alization , sen@@ ti@@ ence , ubi@@ qu@@ ity and most important , evol@@ v@@ ability : those very same things are also present in technology .
the mic@@ rob@@ es in your mouth can fres@@ hen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ec@@ osystems interact with ec@@ osystems on everything we touch .
moving on , there &apos;s more than just natural history ben@@ e@@ ath the sea -- human history . our discover@@ ies of the titanic .
there was an eg@@ g , a tom@@ a@@ to , a head of le@@ t@@ tu@@ ce and a pump@@ k@@ in , and they all lived in this re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator city , and in one of their ad@@ vent@@ ures they went to a ha@@ un@@ ted house that was filled with so many danger@@ s like an evil bl@@ ender who tried to cho@@ p them up , an evil to@@ aster who tried to ki@@ dna@@ p the bre@@ ad couple , and an evil micro@@ wa@@ ve who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of bu@@ tter .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , &quot; fix a pla@@ te &quot; for that person , put it in the o@@ ven , then we could say gra@@ ce , and we could eat .
the world is full of wonder .
but look at how predi@@ c@@ table this is .
i think that comes down to this issue of meaning , of significance , of purpose .
for most small whe@@ eled robots , they use a me@@ thod called differ@@ ential ste@@ ering where the left and right whe@@ el turns the op@@ posi@@ te direction .
what was interesting about the article was people started comm@@ enting on the article , rea@@ ders of the thing .
and those two ro@@ les came together for me in a book that i wrote called &quot; origins . &quot;
math is a much bro@@ ader subject than calcul@@ ating .
jas@@ mine has been his mate for some time .
how do you have sa@@ fer sex , how do you use a con@@ dom reg@@ ularly if there hasn &apos;t been dis@@ clos@@ ure ?
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve p@@ ush@@ ed happiness over the cognitive hori@@ zon as a society .
but at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
what i &apos;m going to show you is i &apos;m g@@ on@@ na stick my arm into it and i will show you how quickly they will bi@@ te .
thank you so much .
seven years ago .
we didn &apos;t want to sh@@ out ; we needed to listen as well .
and much of what i do is either we@@ ar@@ able or somehow related to the human form .
and when the cap@@ su@@ le of my bal@@ lo@@ on was introduced offi@@ cially in the air and space museum in washington , together with the air@@ plane of charles lin@@ d@@ ber@@ gh , with apollo 11 , with the wright bro@@ thers &apos; fl@@ yer , with ch@@ u@@ ck ye@@ ag@@ er &apos;s 6@@ 1 , i had really a thought then .
this is the result that has been rep@@ licated over and over again .
the price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today &apos;s money has a@@ ver@@ a@@ ged about 4@@ 0,000 dollars .
it &apos;s a si@@ x-@@ arm ma@@ ze . and there &apos;s a bit of water in the ma@@ ze to motiv@@ ate the mouse to move , or he &apos;ll just sit there .
and you &apos;ve got to get better , and better , and better , and better .
and this isn &apos;t only happening in am@@ use@@ ment parks .
and when they brought her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your tor@@ ture conf@@ ession and you will be rel@@ eas@@ ed . &quot;
and we developed a pattern together that sc@@ ales to arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily large size , but that allows any fl@@ at ring or dis@@ c to fold down into a very ne@@ at , comp@@ act cy@@ linder .
and we &apos;re building te@@ e@@ pe@@ es in neighbor@@ ho@@ ods that were bur@@ ning down .
transplan@@ ts of the fe@@ ces , of the mic@@ rob@@ es from the fe@@ ces , from a healthy don@@ or has actually been shown to cure syste@@ mic c. di@@ f infe@@ ctions in some people .
and we know that the issue is not just production of food .
they even ga@@ ther together in such groups as the counter@@ -@@ v@@ and@@ al@@ ism un@@ it -- &quot; civili@@ ty , mat@@ uri@@ ty , responsibility &quot; -- to just clean up the pages .
we thought of them as hol@@ y war@@ ri@@ ors who were taking the good fight to the un@@ go@@ dly comm@@ uni@@ sts .
not anymore .
so , to explain this curious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual path@@ ways in the brain .
but then some of us gener@@ alized it further . and then it did !
this is something i did for son@@ y in 1996 .
and they pa@@ sted &#91; over &#93; every single portra@@ it of the dic@@ tat@@ or &#91; with &#93; their own photos .
well , bern@@ ou@@ ll@@ i tells us it is .
because everybody wants to have a big one .
and you like technology , right ?
one and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
according to a theory that dat@@ es back to the 19@@ th century , such memor@@ ies are stor@@ ed as cha@@ ins of syn@@ ap@@ tic conne@@ ctions inside your brain .
another insi@@ ght , which , again , i want to leave with you , in conditions where the problem is very large , which cu@@ ts across all economic strat@@ a , where we have a good solution , i think the process i described , you know , productivity , quality , pati@@ ent@@ -@@ cent@@ ered care , can give an answer , and there are many which fit this para@@ dig@@ m .
and after a while , i developed what i think many of us do , is this predi@@ c@@ table response , where i started to feel bad every time i heard about them .
that &apos;s the red path that &apos;s high@@ ligh@@ ted .
my father worked at this fac@@ tory , &quot; he said .
anybody see an object there ?
in a nuclear power plant , you have a big po@@ t of water that &apos;s under high pressure , and you have some fuel ro@@ ds , and these fuel ro@@ ds are en@@ cas@@ ed in zir@@ con@@ ium , and they &apos;re little pel@@ lets of ur@@ ani@@ um di@@ oxi@@ de fuel , and a fission reaction is controlled and main@@ ta@@ ined at a pro@@ per level , and that reaction he@@ ats up water , the water turns to steam , steam turns the tur@@ bine , and you produce electricity from it .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim cit@@ r@@ in &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and notice , by the way , that most people pick numbers right around there .
we didn &apos;t have a strong government . we didn &apos;t have lots of doctors .
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
so i think my last slide is : all we are saying , we can actually sing it : give nature a chance .
and i &apos;ve got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together , watching the crow@@ ds that gather@@ ed at sa@@ int paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site .
when you see the micro@@ phone , say ... ... yes to decide .
and now , those profit mar@@ g@@ ins are critical , because if you want to scale , if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a kne@@ e , it needs to be econom@@ ically sustainable .
what we did was exp@@ ose american babies during this period to mandar@@ in .
india didn &apos;t want to play the t@@ 20 world c@@ up .
and as you think of biom@@ ateri@@ als , this guy -- who did part of the sequen@@ cing of the human genome , who just dou@@ bl@@ ed the dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es of genes and proteins known on earth by sa@@ iling around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this . and there &apos;s a series of smart people thinking about this . and they &apos;ve been putting together companies like syn@@ thetic genom@@ ics , like , a cam@@ bri@@ a , like co@@ don , and what those companies are trying to do is to think of , how do you apply biological principles to avo@@ id br@@ ute force ?
feeling and model in our head , reality is the outside world .
your father is mur@@ dered .
well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
you see , what is business but the result of how the market beha@@ ves and how the organization beha@@ ves ?
this is the map of the yu@@ an dy@@ na@@ st@@ y , led by ku@@ bla@@ i k@@ han , the grand@@ son of gen@@ gh@@ is k@@ han .
in this example , each electrical impul@@ se , each de@@ fle@@ ction on the tra@@ ce , is caused by a brief pul@@ se of light .
but even if it doesn &apos;t , at least the door is open and there &apos;s a chance . &quot;
but it &apos;s very , very uncomfortable for us to actually ac@@ knowledge that we &apos;re living in such a world .
i &apos;m back in my truck , and we dro@@ ve over the brooklyn bridge .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
we just need to understand the numbers .
but they are incredibly good fli@@ ers . this particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers .
no i &apos;m ki@@ dding -- we don &apos;t -- i thought it best to talk in pictures .
together , the in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants created public spac@@ es and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an un@@ finished tower .
and if it isn &apos;t then it produ@@ ces a shape which is very ph@@ on@@ aes@@ the@@ tically ti@@ ghtly cou@@ pl@@ ed to the sounds you made .
how does nature ga@@ ther the sun &apos;s energy ?
they don &apos;t look at pictures of the pos@@ es . we don &apos;t want to prime them with a concept of power . we want them to be feeling power , right ? so two minutes they do this .
it &apos;s a sense of economy and a sense , also , of humor .
one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home , and i would su@@ ck the thum@@ b of my left hand and hold my mom &apos;s cold to@@ es with my right hand .
david br@@ in was going to debate me on this , and as i walked in , the crow@@ d of a hundred started boo@@ ing lu@@ sti@@ ly .
o@@ op . mental note right there . again , we &apos;ll get back to that .
one young woman i met , te@@ en mother of four , never thought about fin@@ ishing high school , gradu@@ ated success@@ fully ; never thought about going to college , en@@ roll@@ ed in college .
it &apos;s just a design of pit@@ ches and silence and time .
we &apos;re using a planet &apos;s worth of land already .
and our colleagues in washington , d@@ .@@ c .
but i couldn &apos;t do anything else .
how many say the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?
it was great for their genetic fit@@ ness .
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop .
so , wood . we know with fore@@ stry , it &apos;s a choice .
and i &apos;m not talking about the mo@@ ther@@ hood sense here .
we see that play itself out with em@@ pathy and respect .
and i want to share with you how i came to that place and what i &apos;ve learned since i left it .
we know for example that we now have speci@@ alized eye tra@@ ck@@ ers and in@@ fr@@ ared brain scans , mri &apos;s that can de@@ code the signals that our bodies send out when we &apos;re trying to be dec@@ ep@@ tive .
and then everyone was up on the ro@@ of , so i ran up there .
and that doesn &apos;t just work for me in terms of ab@@ stra@@ ct numbers -- this over@@ load of health information that we &apos;re in@@ und@@ ated with .
and he told me that , &quot; this can be won milit@@ arily , minister .
i &apos;m curious , show of hands , who agre@@ es with it ?
this was being sold to high school admini@@ strat@@ ors for 9@@ 00 dollars a piece .
so now i want to introduce you to my new her@@ o in the global climate change war , and that is the eastern o@@ y@@ ster .
and because he &apos;s per@@ forming a behavior you &apos;ve tra@@ ined him to do ?
we need to think about this in today &apos;s world .
that &apos;s the kind of rules that the cell@@ phone company that nel@@ son pur@@ chas@@ es his tele@@ ph@@ ony from oper@@ ates under .
these are hop@@ ping micro@@ bo@@ t s@@ war@@ ms .
you go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term .
things slow down as you learn , as you learn , as you learn .
and there &apos;s one solution that &apos;s probably only a few years off .
he &apos;s pun@@ ching our contro@@ ls guy . the guy behind him is our engine@@ er / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around .
mar@@ co temp@@ est : a cyber@@ -@@ magic card tri@@ ck like no other
one is seeing what &apos;s right in front of you , and talking about it , and stat@@ ing it . i think what i learned from talking about the vagina , and speaking about the vagina , is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about .
practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral sk@@ ill to figure out what the right thing is .

and i think we shouldn &apos;t sh@@ y away in architecture , you know , brain surgery , atom@@ ic theory , genetics , economics are complex complex fields .
it &apos;s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before .
and they didn &apos;t achieve powered man flight , and the wright bro@@ thers be@@ at them to it .
colle@@ ctive security is not enough .
so in 196@@ 5 , i went to what was called the worst bi@@ ha@@ r fam@@ ine in india , and i saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time .
but more interestingly , the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics of this say , you &apos;re never going to get more than 20 percent effici@@ ency .
this is a very bus@@ y table , but what this really is con@@ ve@@ ying is that , when it comes to quality , we have put in very good qu@@ al@@ it@@ y-@@ ass@@ ur@@ ance systems .
we have to make this available for people . &quot;
you don &apos;t necessarily have to win . there is jer@@ ry brown .
it could be that there is other things which makes trans@@ mission occu@@ r in a higher frequ@@ ency .
we also have part@@ ner@@ ed with ted in this project , with architecture for humanity , and along with the ted prize w@@ inner camer@@ on sin@@ cla@@ ir , we &apos;re having a con@@ test that we have issu@@ ed to the architec@@ tural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emer@@ ging region .
nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ?
repe@@ ti@@ tion creates pattern .
you know we use p@@ v@@ c , and we she@@ ath wir@@ es with p@@ v@@ c for insu@@ lation .
and yet , when the situation changes , you suddenly hear politi@@ cians talking as if , you know , for example , the life of one american soldi@@ er is worth coun@@ tless numbers of ira@@ q@@ i civili@@ ans .
that &apos;s most certainly not the case in the middle east where countries are still very uncomfortable in the bor@@ ders left behind by european coloni@@ alists .
so the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of depen@@ den@@ cy .
first they have clean@@ ed the society , then it will be hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , and soon india .
so how did his nose become his nose , his el@@ bow his el@@ bow , and why doesn &apos;t he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot ?
this is probably a better picture .
and they estim@@ ated that in 2008 , kenya had per child mortality of 12@@ 8 .
mt : tes@@ la &apos;s career as an inv@@ ent@@ or never re@@ covered .
aids .
and so we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work .
we can allow smart and lu@@ cra@@ tive growth models that help people already be near where they want to be , so they don &apos;t need to go somewhere else .
with human@@ i@@ zed technology we can monit@@ or the quality of your sleep cy@@ cles .
i can be@@ am them to whi@@ ch@@ ever school i want to .
and actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than us@@ eless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
in case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like .
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , tal@@ ent and technology .
keeping a baby warm for a week , that &apos;s not ro@@ cket science .
you can &apos;t keep a good idea down these days .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
so what i &apos;m going to ask is , basically , is history repe@@ ating itself ?
that &apos;s how dist@@ ant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours .
so steve and i , through mathematical analysis , pro@@ pose that there &apos;s actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this , which lies in our brains .
but ask y@@ ourselves : what will be the biggest se@@ ctors of the economy in 10 , 20 , 30 years time ? it won &apos;t be the ones lin@@ ing up for hand@@ ou@@ ts , like cars and a@@ er@@ os@@ pace and so on .
this group , others have called the &quot; pro ams , &quot; am@@ at@@ eu@@ r artists doing work at a professional level .
a pros@@ thetic li@@ m@@ b doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
i never really knew whether it worked .
now , you need a laptop .
imagine that was lake super@@ ior .
he was the architect of the great society program@@ s under ly@@ n@@ don john@@ son in the 196@@ 0s .
sometimes you see them , they look , &quot; oh . &quot;
because our hamburger recip@@ e , our ultimate hamburger recip@@ e , if you make the b@@ uns and you mar@@ in@@ ate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours .
and nobody cele@@ br@@ ates imit@@ ation the way &quot; dirty jobs &quot; guys know it has to be done .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and so she said , &quot; so , if i came out of the wo@@ ods &quot; — this is her brother and sister — &quot; if i came out of the wo@@ ods , a@@ val@@ on and don@@ o@@ van might be gone . &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
but the more we address it as a practical conc@@ ern , the so@@ on@@ er we can resol@@ ve it , and the more time we have to resol@@ ve it , para@@ do@@ x@@ ically .
in fact , des@@ pa@@ ir is in the air .
this is the himala@@ y@@ as . up in the north , very cold .
i ass@@ ure you , that &apos;s not the case .
but apart from that , everything else goes through contra@@ ctions of mus@@ cles .
he &apos;s always on the road .
but the main charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of roman@@ tic love are cra@@ ving : an inten@@ se cra@@ ving to be with a particular person , not just sex@@ ually , but emotion@@ ally .
this is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ esses , tradition@@ ally .
and we all know in our heart of hear@@ ts that this is not the way the universe works .
and notice , most of that went to the mo@@ ther@@ land , to the im@@ peri@@ al me@@ tro@@ pol@@ es , not to their coloni@@ al pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons .
then they told me how le@@ hi and his des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts re@@ produced and re@@ produced , and over the course of 600 years there were two great ra@@ ces of them , the ne@@ ph@@ ites and the lam@@ an@@ ites , and the ne@@ ph@@ ites were totally , totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the lam@@ an@@ ites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone .
by being at ted , we see so many things at one time .
he does deser@@ ve a lot of ap@@ pl@@ ause because i don &apos;t think he &apos;s sle@@ pt much in the last three months , actually .
se@@ ba@@ stian &apos;s teaching another class now .
so here , in wo@@ ol , through a dom@@ esti@@ c femin@@ ine art , is the pro@@ of that the most famous po@@ stu@@ late in mathematics is wrong .
but big selling book@@ case . how do we rep@@ licate this for children ?
i was lost .
now , z@@ ach , we &apos;re going to demon@@ strate a water gu@@ n fight from the future .
it was like nar@@ nia .
and the second reason is because , whereas in europe and north america , the state &apos;s power is continu@@ ously challen@@ ged -- i mean in the european tradition , histor@@ ically against the church , against other se@@ ctors of the ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ cy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on -- for 1,000 years , the power of the chinese state has not been challen@@ ged .
m@@ m : because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
then you &apos;ve wa@@ sted 200 billion dollars in un@@ necessary tests .
by building together open , free , se@@ cure systems , we can go around such sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
because what we actually count truly coun@@ ts .
i put half the lab up in my house .
here they even got the help of the fire@@ men .
j@@ ac@@ qu@@ el@@ ine no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz : a third way to think about aid
and my friend was prepar@@ ing this big bowl , and i said , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
girl : 5@@ 81 . this house is 5@@ 81 ...
and then the next plan@@ ting seas@@ on , when they s@@ ang the dir@@ ge , they would re@@ move as many names of the dead that equ@@ aled as many people that were born .
they p@@ ine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
some of the poor@@ er countries that have had the most experience with h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 have built up sto@@ ck@@ pil@@ es ; they &apos;re already ex@@ pi@@ red . they are already out of date .
ar@@ th@@ ur c. cl@@ ar@@ ke : and they can defin@@ it@@ ely help people , because children quickly learn to navi@@ gate the web and find things which interest them .
and this is so important in breaking through the sti@@ g@@ ma .
i mean , i &apos;m going to see so much work , it &apos;s so inten@@ se -- i know probably las v@@ eg@@ as meant a lot about it , and i &apos;m not really sure where the grand canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together , and i &apos;m going to see some really great product .
my personal a@@ im is to de@@ fe@@ at the tas@@ mani@@ an devi@@ l cancer .
there &apos;s no more relationship there .
well , it &apos;s probably micros@@ cop@@ ic , and it &apos;s never easy to study micros@@ cop@@ ic things , although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater dep@@ th , at much smaller sc@@ ales than ever before .
but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adul@@ tho@@ od .
and so they created these spac@@ es to refle@@ ct what they love to do , and who they were .
and what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true : that for children two years old and up , there really is no real benefit -- pro@@ ven benefit -- of car se@@ ats , in spi@@ te of the incredible energy that has been de@@ voted toward exp@@ and@@ ing the laws and making it so@@ cially un@@ accep@@ table to put your children into se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts . and then talk about why -- what is it that makes that true ?
but then where it says &quot; low social class , &quot; that &apos;s uns@@ killed man@@ ual occu@@ pa@@ tions .
the wall was covered with ...
pat@@ rice and pat@@ ee set out most days to go out hun@@ ting in the forest around their homes .
and we thought that these people should come into the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
these red are the countries that doesn &apos;t do it , and the policy has to be impro@@ ved .
it &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
but i must say they are no longer natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
it &apos;s not just in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate , it becomes really un@@ safe .
then we &apos;re going to challenge the ted atten@@ de@@ es to come up with a way to improve health care in the usa , where we have problems that africa doesn &apos;t have .
our bat@@ t@@ les@@ hi@@ ps , our soldiers , are on a fron@@ tier now , almost ready to go to war with iraq .
and i will v@@ ou@@ ch that it hand@@ led the st@@ op@@ -@@ and-@@ go traffic on u.s. 1@@ 0@@ 1 very smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly .
how boring to run around chasing you .
first off , r@@ y@@ an and i decided to create a non@@ profit called re@@ vi@@ ve and re@@ store that would push de-@@ ex@@ tin@@ ction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way , and we would push ahead with the passen@@ ger pi@@ geon .
there &apos;s an amazing river traveling through it , and you can see there how we manage to get across the river .
this is a little p@@ lot , and every time you show a p@@ lot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
these are children like u@@ mar .
and basically saying that &quot; i believe that all people across the planet have equal consi@@ der@@ ation , and if in power we will act in that way .
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really inten@@ se .
i can tell you , there isn &apos;t a person in this room that would sit i@@ dly by .
move your eyes around , blin@@ k , maybe close one eye .
please stop ! &quot;
in red are the eye movement tra@@ ces .
there should be some kind of brain trust .
i love that word .
as i was temp@@ ted to eat the ro@@ tten fl@@ es@@ h of my com@@ ra@@ de , he gave me com@@ fort .
so you could tun@@ e into po@@ e@@ try as you were flying .
and i saw phy@@ lli@@ s , and i wat@@ ched her .
and one of the appli@@ cations that we &apos;ve been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of tra@@ ction worldwide -- is the appli@@ cation of virtual au@@ top@@ si@@ es .
so this was one particular problem they talked about , that it might be used in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately .
now if those books are not lost to history , then they are somewhere in a library , and many of those books have been getting re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed from the libr@@ ari@@ es and digiti@@ zed by google , which has scan@@ ned 15 million books to date .
and so we use a virus that &apos;s a non-@@ tox@@ ic virus called m@@ 13 bacter@@ iop@@ ha@@ ge that &apos;s job is to infe@@ ct bacteria .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be up@@ dated to 2.@@ 0 and we will have cli@@ ck@@ -@@ through pur@@ chas@@ es of off@@ se@@ ts .
the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful , beautiful child , and i remember , as she was appro@@ aching me , the voices of friends saying , &quot; the moment they put the baby in your hands , you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is &#91; on &#93; an order of magni@@ tu@@ de more powerful than anything you &apos;ve ever experi@@ enced in your entire life . &quot;
and from out of stage left comes this wild , male pol@@ ar be@@ ar , with a predat@@ ory ga@@ ze .
it was here that i had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what i call the &quot; repres@@ ent@@ ative foreig@@ ner . &quot;
and we believe that it &apos;s in this way that the different to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanze@@ e popu@@ lations studied in africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next , through obser@@ vation , imit@@ ation and practice , so that we can describe these to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behaviors as primi@@ tive culture .
a computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- i would hope , at least .
ak : and once we put ka@@ ther@@ ine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a horse , which could be ri@@ dden .
so ...
as many as 16@@ 5 million people would die .
and he &apos;ll say , &quot; you &apos;re off@@ ering me things that are infin@@ it@@ ely vari@@ able . &quot;
that &apos;s all there is to it .
it was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection .
and because we were doing that , some local acade@@ mic@@ s said , &quot; you know , we could help design a commercial hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ ture course for you .
i can give sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ships to all the girls , you know , if they work hard and stay in school .
it will address transc@@ end@@ ent qualities in the human consciousness , and sense of human need .
yes , the ine@@ quality goes in this direction , or i would pos@@ it it .
so each of you has really just a couple sent@@ ences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
tr@@ ash the system or crash the planet -- it &apos;s a t@@ ough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
you go to wikipedia and the first map you find is this .
many cases were re@@ vie@@ wed .
r@@ he@@ x &apos;s foot started off to be quite simple , then it got tun@@ ed over time , and ultimately resul@@ ted in this half circle .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the man@@ ual for the camera is so much bigger than the car man@@ ual .
but he &apos;s still an adul@@ ter@@ er , and still quite angry .
it doesn &apos;t really work in this context .
and you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-@@ head appe@@ ars and you average them . ok ?
in ad@@ dition to which there &apos;s an enorm@@ ous amount of back and forth , ment@@ oring of one student by another , of all the students by the doctors , and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors who do have time for the people they treat .
the metaphor that i like to use is the metaphor of the circu@@ lar mil@@ l .
this terri@@ fied people .
by the time i get to australia , if i get to australia , i will have ro@@ wed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all .
i remember so many patients , their names still vi@@ vid on my ton@@ gue , their faces still so clear .
and i think i &apos;ve found , in some ways , what is the secret to peace .
so here are some examples : these are some natural sh@@ ells .
here &apos;s another crow@@ d in me@@ c@@ ca .
but look at what happened to the babies ex@@ posed to mandar@@ in for 12 s@@ essi@@ ons .
we &apos;ve got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right out@@ come , the prof@@ it@@ able out@@ come , and therefore the likely out@@ come .
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensory appar@@ at@@ us , and so on .
diagn@@ osed with cancer , bru@@ ce fei@@ ler worried first about his young family . so -- as he shar@@ es in this funny , r@@ am@@ bling and ultimately thou@@ ght@@ ful talk -- he asked his clos@@ est friends to become a &quot; coun@@ cil of da@@ ds , &quot; bringing their own life@@ times of wisdom to adv@@ ise his t@@ win daugh@@ ters as they grow .
and telling people they &apos;re going to die is too scary to think about , or , they &apos;re going to get em@@ phy@@ se@@ ma or heart attack is too scary , and so they don &apos;t want to think about it , so they don &apos;t .
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systema@@ tic corruption , was under@@ mining everything we were trying to do .
and justice stev@@ ens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few stro@@ kes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but inci@@ dent@@ al .
and it was deep . it was deep in my sou@@ l .
just type over it .
and i called it the mutter@@ ing hat , because it em@@ it@@ ted these mutter@@ ing no@@ ises that were kind of te@@ ther@@ ed to you , but you could deta@@ ch them and share them with somebody else .
well , of course , i went to the theater to see the play .
well , i defin@@ it@@ ely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through , and here &apos;s just a few reasons why .
for example , in poli@@ te requ@@ est@@ s , if someone says , &quot; if you could pass the gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole , that would be awesome , &quot; we know exactly what he means , even though that &apos;s a rather bi@@ zar@@ re concept being expres@@ sed .
people immediately jum@@ p to concer@@ ns about biological war@@ f@@ are , and i had re@@ cent te@@ stim@@ ony before a sen@@ ate commit@@ tee , and a special commit@@ tee the u.s. government has set up to re@@ view this area .
it &apos;s easy to b@@ end .
so , this story of the evolution of dance seems str@@ angel@@ y familiar .
and i follo@@ wed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
america was j@@ ol@@ ted by the anti-@@ viet@@ na@@ m movement , the civil rights movement .
i &apos;d collected -- i was a colle@@ ctor , major , big@@ -@@ time .
my american room@@ mate was shocked by me .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
but people do because it &apos;s so cheap , and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shif@@ ted .
my a@@ unt , an incredibly artic@@ u@@ late and brilliant woman , was wi@@ do@@ wed early .
why does everyone get rid of me ?
you know , when i looked at the profile of the audience here , with their con@@ not@@ ations and design , in all its forms , and with so much and so many people working on collabor@@ ative and networks , and so on , that i wanted to tell you , i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context .
in the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wr@@ apped up in its spe@@ cu@@ la@@ tive value .
or you can be transc@@ end@@ ent@@ al future : nam@@ ely , life beg@@ ins after death .
down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-@@ space of this larger space that is accessi@@ ble to human beings -- beings with our biological capac@@ i@@ ties .
when it &apos;s boun@@ ced on the moon , we see it .
so , em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you &apos;ll get conf@@ used and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot;
and could this be a goal for edu@@ ca@@ tional technology in the future ?
the two wi@@ zar@@ ds that i have that are behind the cur@@ tain will help me bring the results on the screen .
so here &apos;s a tale of passion .
facebook : every time you add a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to digiti@@ ze a book .
so the second rule is i get important information back .
they need to learn to respect their scho@@ ol@@ mates .
this is pretty typical among fol@@ k sing@@ ers .
unfortunately , though , the site was separated from the river by mclean b@@ oule@@ vard so i suggest@@ ed , &quot; let &apos;s r@@ er@@ ou@@ te mclean , &quot; and that gave birth inst@@ antly to friends of mclean b@@ oule@@ vard .
in an audience as sop@@ hi@@ sticated as this one , that would be pre@@ aching to the cho@@ ir .
i would say that there are many , many g@@ aps in se@@ cu@@ lar life and these can be pl@@ ug@@ ged .
this is a popular explanation , and there &apos;s lots of truth to it , because taking big ris@@ ks , as we all know , pa@@ ys a lot of money .
it ain &apos;t pretty .
almost every one of those has come true just a few years later .
hans rosling : the good news of the decade ?
we were able to mobili@@ ze gh@@ ana@@ i@@ ans in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a to in@@ sti@@ gate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana .
how do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brin@@ k of war ?
that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history .
the bottom picture is hit@@ ler you@@ th .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate gener@@ alization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
and being the yo@@ un@@ gest of seven , i have never been at the front of the line for anything . ok ?
so , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft doesn &apos;t look like any plane you would take on v@@ ac@@ ation .
some of my hypo@@ thes@@ es are that when you first think about skelet@@ al mus@@ cle , there &apos;s a lot of blood vessels going to skelet@@ al mus@@ cle .
now , you talk straight to me , what &apos;s wrong with my fil@@ ms ?
the u.s. has invest@@ ed four billion dollars conver@@ ting to digital mammo@@ graphy equipment , and what have we ga@@ ined from that investment ?
but every once in a while , as dwi@@ ght ei@@ sen@@ ho@@ wer said , the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger .
no , we &apos;re having a little fun .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
in fact , what if it &apos;s a symp@@ tom of a much deeper problem , the ti@@ p of a pro@@ ver@@ bial ic@@ e@@ berg ?
and what &apos;s happened is they &apos;ve used this learning process to develop a new sign that identi@@ fi@@ es this new social group .
there is re@@ covery .
but the bri@@ d@@ ges that we saw that open@@ ed and clos@@ ed -- i &apos;m slightly squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish -- but i once saw a photograph of a foot@@ b@@ aller who was di@@ ving for a ball .
he &apos;s like , &quot; huh ! &quot;
ar@@ ab countries not so much , but iran is quite high .
so we have companies and non-@@ prof@@ its and ch@@ ari@@ ties and all these groups that have employees or volunte@@ ers of some sort .
and more importantly , what are we going to do about it ?
it pre@@ ps you . it a@@ im@@ s you .
and i think this just shows how we were appro@@ aching the problem of incredibly lar@@ ge-@@ scale construction .
that &apos;s the first thing .
so our concept is really this back@@ -@@ to-@@ the@@ -@@ future concept , har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing the intelligence of that land se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment pattern .
a little bit of differ@@ ential , but not much .
it doesn &apos;t really feel like playing min@@ d@@ less action video games .
so don &apos;t hang on ti@@ ll the bit@@ ter end .
and that , after a couple of days , made the ken@@ y@@ an press feel safe to talk about it .
but 99 percent of chinese micro@@ blog@@ gers stand fir@@ m@@ ly on the em@@ b@@ ass@@ y &apos;s side .
the language diff@@ ers , but the obje@@ ctive is the same .
does anyone know ? ch@@ i ?
and that was , of course , the very common story .
but of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ri@@ p@@ ples hit the -- poor fish , they can &apos;t find any peace and quie@@ t .
thank you .
many , many people have died on mt . everest , and this was the year they decided to go and re@@ cover all the bodies of the moun@@ ta@@ ine@@ ers and then bring them down the mountain .
this is a culture that has yiel@@ ded ell@@ s@@ worth wh@@ are@@ ham .
so we have to try these devices out because the fda won &apos;t just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be p@@ ig@@ s .
it is compassion , says the buddha , which brings you to nir@@ van@@ a .
if you have a water@@ fall in there , right out there at the hori@@ zon ; you look at the water@@ fall and you go , &quot; oh , the water is falling really slowly . &quot;
for community though , we start at the very beginning .
underneath this cer@@ em@@ oni@@ al role , he was really mo@@ dest and really intro@@ ver@@ ted -- so much so that when he delivered these ser@@ mon@@ s , he had trouble making eye cont@@ act with the very same con@@ gre@@ gation that he had been speaking to for 6@@ 2 years .
my talk is &quot; fl@@ apping birds and space teles@@ cop@@ es . &quot;
that &apos;s basically all we &apos;re going to be talking about here .
s@@ b : no , malaria , there is a can@@ di@@ date that actually showed eff@@ ic@@ acy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now .
and now today we have the modern multi@@ -@@ chan@@ ne@@ l co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant , which is an out@@ patient proce@@ dur@@ e .
i wo@@ ke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family , without work , could not fill it .
it &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
the re@@ ven@@ ues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ g@@ in while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
a then un@@ known philosop@@ her named adam s@@ mit@@ h wrote a book in 17@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; the theory of moral sen@@ ti@@ ments . &quot;
they would say , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
now , with r@@ fi@@ ds and other things -- whatever technology it is , it doesn &apos;t really matter . the point is that everything will have embedded in it some sen@@ s@@ or conne@@ cting it to the machine , and so we have , basically , an internet of things .
and also , you can engage in shape manipu@@ lation of that product , but within boun@@ dar@@ ies that are safe .
an@@ it@@ a ro@@ d@@ dick is another one of these ce@@ os we intervie@@ wed .
and i walked out , and this really mira@@ cul@@ ous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter , which was that the streets were completely alive with people .
here in south ken@@ sing@@ ton , we will build the analy@@ tical engine .
and let these dots represent the land that &apos;s already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in .
they would be really useful . &quot;
he had ser@@ van@@ ts to answer any wh@@ im , and he had a family who loved him deeply .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have r@@ amp@@ ant , promis@@ cu@@ ous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
and even skin infe@@ ction , which we origin@@ ally thought wasn &apos;t that big a problem , mil@@ d skin infe@@ ctions n@@ au@@ ght to five give you a great@@ ly increased chance of ren@@ al failure , nee@@ ding di@@ aly@@ sis at age 40 .
and i &apos;ll kind of let it speak for itself .
now , for decades there has been a can@@ on@@ ical solution to this problem , which is to use something called and a version control system does what is says on the tin .
however , engineers tend to look at things a little bit more new@@ ton@@ ian , instead of this qu@@ ant@@ um approach .
unlike the grand canyon or the washington mon@@ um@@ ent , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
let us cele@@ bra@@ te diversity .
in a similar way , we have created the do@@ ha film institute .
you know , the study of human origins is kind of in our dna , and we want to take it to the next level .
just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , suddenly man@@ ages to find a corner in the to@@ i@@ let to check that her children are sa@@ f@@ ely home .
so some of you may know about the chemical bis@@ phen@@ ol a , b@@ pa .
this is true . and yet here we are , my church in oxford , se@@ mi@@ -@@ deta@@ ched from events that happened a long way away , but with our faith bru@@ is@@ ed .
people will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the oc@@ c@@ asi@@ ons when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t .
that is the last four years of law@@ su@@ its in the real@@ m of smart@@ phones .
and this flu has wi@@ ped through the population of be@@ es .
what &apos;s the key to using alternative energy , like solar and wind ? stor@@ age -- so we can have power on ta@@ p even when the sun &apos;s not out and the wind &apos;s not blo@@ wing . in this accessi@@ ble , in@@ spir@@ ing talk , donald sa@@ do@@ way takes to the black@@ board to show us the future of lar@@ ge-@@ scale batter@@ ies that store ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy . as he says : &quot; we need to think about the problem differently . we need to think big . we need to think cheap . &quot;
children at this u@@ kra@@ ini@@ an or@@ phan@@ age are between the ages of six and 16 .
so there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
so i know i went super fast . if you mis@@ sed anything , i &apos;ll be happy to send you the list of these ti@@ ps .
this instrument came up in those pictures . it &apos;s called the mouth bow .
and we sat here and we looked at these two problems , and finally we came to a reali@@ zation . these aren &apos;t problems .
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
essentially , for three reasons : calcu@@ lation , appli@@ cation , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration .
sylvia li@@ kes to say that blue is the new green .
and i wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big bre@@ ak@@ through@@ s , because they haven &apos;t happened yet , but to show you the level of inten@@ tion and focus that these dolphins have , and interest in the system .
now , appar@@ ently in jer@@ usalem in 600 b@@ c , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , in@@ f@@ ant , fe@@ tus .
i was reading head@@ lines about the rec@@ ession just like anyone else , and i started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the rec@@ ession was affec@@ ting men much more deeply than it was affec@@ ting women .
so , i mean , these are the things you can do , and you can always use the humor .
i have a little cu@@ ban mother -- she &apos;s about that big .
and the next story is called , &quot; on the human la@@ p . &quot;
you lose the institu@@ tional im@@ per@@ ative .
and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of reme@@ dies , in the imple@@ ment@@ ation of re@@ forms , and then later , in the monit@@ oring of re@@ forms .
who thinks that a is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take longer to see head-tail-@@ head than head-tail-@@ tail ?
talk very brie@@ fly about innovation cy@@ cles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they &apos;re re@@ placed by something else .
we have one body , not two , not three .
we don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
but we &apos;ll talk more about the water@@ mar@@ ks in a minute .
right , and do you have a web address that we might look for yet ?
and that &apos;s what art is .
you can see the win@@ spe@@ ar oper@@ a house on the right and the de@@ e and charles w@@ y@@ ly theater on the left .
because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you &apos;ll always know , i could have been a her@@ o and i let it pass me by .
there are still some kri@@ ll in antar@@ c@@ tica .
it &apos;s exponenti@@ ally impro@@ ving . now , expon@@ ential is an over@@ worked word . you hear it on the media all the time .
and they need to have access to all of the trial data .
and in all these univer@@ ses , it &apos;s like imagination is the vehicle to be transpor@@ ted with , but the dest@@ ination is our minds and how we can re@@ connect with the essential and with the magic .
and it has to be sol@@ vable in a magazine .
and i sent out this call to sing@@ ers .
rand@@ om@@ ly assig@@ ned them to be prison@@ er and gu@@ ard .
technology is amazing . people are innovative .
he &apos;s been a che@@ er@@ leader for quite a long time .
we &apos;re probably going to have to give them support , encoura@@ gement .
six@@ ty-@@ four , that no one at any age , any gender , could ever do , has done it , and there &apos;s no doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today .
thank you .
re@@ pu@@ tation is the measu@@ rement of how much a community tru@@ sts you .
and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here .
i was quite shocked by that , and thought to myself , &quot; well , ok then .
and in order to get these kinds of compu@@ tations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of se@@ ed .
he su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf c@@ art , because the law says that the dis@@ ab@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ated , provided the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
and this time , i don &apos;t like it , i didn &apos;t want to give into it , but there &apos;s a difference between a non-@@ stop swim and a sta@@ ged swim .
and a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate , and because of their kind of re@@ production , they can com@@ bine and produce a new virus .
now we do day@@ dre@@ aming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
that is what econom@@ i@@ sts do .
&quot; what is this ?
in other words , i had dr@@ un@@ k our great cultural ko@@ ol@@ -@@ aid about regre@@ t , which is that lam@@ enting things that occurred in the past is an absol@@ ute waste of time , that we should always look forward and not back@@ ward , and that one of the no@@ bl@@ est and best things we can do is stri@@ ve to live a life free of regre@@ ts .
the net is doing the work in the brain .
and we found america &apos;s lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived population among the se@@ ven@@ th-@@ day adv@@ enti@@ sts concent@@ rated in and around l@@ oma lin@@ da , california .
and this squ@@ ad@@ r@@ on of ge@@ ese come over .
so we need to think about , as was spo@@ ken earlier , the traditional african metho@@ ds for doing self-@@ organization .
the ac@@ id will ru@@ in the gold pl@@ ating .
because my favorite thing about her , other than , like , everything , is that she is very -- has always been un@@ ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically present on stage , and un@@ ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic about her fla@@ ws and about re@@ conc@@ iling all of her con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them , and yeah , so please be stev@@ ie ni@@ cks .
this is all at the same time .
and i &apos;ve just been so thri@@ ll@@ ed , finally , to come to people talking about comp@@ ost lat@@ r@@ ines .
and the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information .
so one is that , of course , as we all might expect , many small businesses in the u.s. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month .
for example , that a two-@@ cy@@ linder gas engine was used in a car with a single balan@@ cer sha@@ ft .
my guess is that we &apos;re re@@ aching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- i say 400 years because it &apos;s the end of the ot@@ tom@@ an em@@ pi@@ re -- of the he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y of western power , western institutions and western values .
bring them to areas where they &apos;re thri@@ ving and try to make them health@@ ier before they get sick .
and the united states is responsible for almost one half of the world &apos;s military spending -- and you feel it ; you see it every day .
you can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hypo@@ thes@@ es .
but here , brian cap@@ tured a unique view by posi@@ tioning himself underneath the bo@@ at when they thre@@ w the waste over@@ board .
i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature , but i became a pre@@ a@@ cher .
so , should v@@ ander play football ?
a lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .
tag it . at@@ tribu@@ te it . me@@ ta@@ data . get the community to add local dep@@ th , global perspective , local knowledge .
and that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk , which we &apos;ll see if that happens for everyone , you will be a pre-@@ vi@@ vor .
and i photograph@@ ed all of the wr@@ ong@@ fully con@@ vi@@ cted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wr@@ ong@@ ful con@@ vi@@ ction .
eight enti@@ ties came to the table .
because you have to base it on a yes or no .
and that &apos;s a simple question .
what are the main cu@@ stom@@ ers of the future ?
that &apos;s what i thought until i came here . &quot;
what we &apos;re looking at here is the insi@@ di@@ ous cost of ring@@ t@@ one pi@@ ra@@ cy .
the up@@ shot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all .
now some of you here look a bit aston@@ ished by that number , but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental ill@@ n@@ esses , from autis@@ m and intellectual dis@@ ability in childhood , through to depression and an@@ xiety , substance mis@@ use and psych@@ osis in adul@@ tho@@ od , all the way through to demen@@ tia in old age , and i &apos;m pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person , at least one person , who &apos;s affected by mental illness in our most in@@ ti@@ mate social networks .
and you can make a map of the americ@@ as and sp@@ ell dna with dna .
darwin didn &apos;t , of course ; he didn &apos;t know about genes .
so the first bat@@ ch of computers are being inst@@ alled later this summer , and we &apos;re helping dr. zu@@ ll@@ inger develop some strate@@ gi@@ es around how we might connect the class@@ room and the home to ex@@ tend learning beyond the school day .
as you can see , they cut across the entire glo@@ be all the way from mic@@ ron@@ es@@ ia across indones@@ ia , mala@@ y@@ si@@ a , india , ma@@ da@@ gas@@ car and to the west of the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an .
they would bring them back and mo@@ unt them .
now help me not to be a beg@@ gar anymore . &quot;
turn them on their sides , com@@ bine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the bran@@ ches going up .
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
it &apos;s not always a good day , so when you have a bad one , i think it &apos;s important to remember it , just as much as it is important to remember the &#91; good &#93; days .
and therefore democracy has become embedded .
and so ab@@ c and son@@ y have de@@ vis@@ ed this new thing where when you step in the line in the super@@ market -- initi@@ ally it &apos;ll be safe@@ ways . it is safe@@ ways ; they &apos;re trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you &apos;ll be watching tv .
so , huge things in construction , real est@@ ate , mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge markets . financial services : we had 89 ban@@ ks . too many not doing their real business .
well for health , i &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome ingredients that are good for my body .
they &apos;re very large .
because we &apos;re starting to see these enter@@ pris@@ es reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i disc@@ ussed have re@@ ach@@ ed at least a quar@@ ter million people .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last s@@ ession we had about africa and his hypo@@ the@@ tical 50 billion dollars dest@@ ined for africa .
and when i tell people about this , they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 .
the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .
in fact , for years , the tro@@ pi@@ c of cancer and the tro@@ pi@@ c of cap@@ ri@@ cor@@ n have been ste@@ adi@@ ly dri@@ f@@ ting towards the equ@@ ator at the rate of about 15 meters per year , and nobody told me that .
i can &apos;t feel my li@@ ps ; my face is fro@@ zen ; i can &apos;t feel my hands ; i can &apos;t feel my feet .
that is something that i did not get over .
and i got a lot of them during what &apos;s been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that &apos;s been going on .
but no har@@ m . you just move away .
now many people begin trying to thum@@ b@@ t@@ ack the c@@ and@@ le to the wall .
you &apos;re never , there &apos;s just , ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ i@@ tions are possible that just aren &apos;t , you don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to happen .
right now there are 48 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to youtube every single minute .
when you &apos;re ti@@ red of opening and clos@@ ing those blin@@ ds day after day , when you &apos;re on v@@ ac@@ ation and there &apos;s no one there on the wee@@ ken@@ ds to be turning off and on the contro@@ ls , or when there &apos;s a power ou@@ tage , and you have no electricity to rely on , these thermo@@ -@@ bi@@ met@@ als will still be working ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly , effici@@ ently and end@@ less@@ ly . thank you .
so i thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the re@@ construction of temporary hous@@ ing .
at the same time , our de@@ bt level &apos;s gone up to 120 and we &apos;re all feeling slightly mis@@ er@@ able as a result .
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
nobody has questi@@ oned it .
how does this work ? well , on the left side here you see a u@@ re@@ thr@@ a which was in@@ ju@@ red .
but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not rela@@ tively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already commit@@ ted 100,000 soldiers previ@@ ously .
so , this is mine .
and my idea was to make the space tangi@@ ble .
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hur@@ d@@ le rate gets set very low . people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels , or for wind , or for something else , and then guess what ?
and it makes no difference to their life expec@@ tancy at all .
but this is different .
and i went to that address and kno@@ cked on the door , and a man ans@@ wer@@ ed the door .
and he would have tremendous fun doing that .
thank you .
the first two le@@ tters of the word &quot; log@@ in , &quot; that &apos;s all that made it through -- an l and an o -- and then a bu@@ ff@@ er over@@ flow crash@@ ed the system .
and what they taught us was that designing a check@@ list to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficul@@ ty than i had understood .
and every business i &apos;ve been working on over the past five years , i &apos;m trying to lower each one of these elements .
and who are wa@@ ving their first books in the air , which , i just think that &apos;s a pretty cool picture . you know ?
i have since left iraq and fo@@ unded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survi@@ vor@@ s of wars .
this is 20 mic@@ r@@ ons thin , so this is about a baby hair &apos;s wid@@ th .
al-@@ je@@ b@@ r finally came into english as al@@ ge@@ bra .
i think of new cities like du@@ bai or an@@ cient cities like ro@@ me with za@@ ha ha@@ did &apos;s incredible max@@ x@@ i museum , or like right here in new york with the high line , a city which has been so much influ@@ enced by the development of this .
and four : maybe consciousness exists , but it can &apos;t make any difference to the world .
i &apos;m holding on to the coun@@ ter because i can &apos;t stand .
the first is that problems are ine@@ vi@@ table .
she was in a great evening go@@ wn .
ba@@ stian sch@@ a@@ ef@@ er : a 3@@ d-@@ prin@@ ted jum@@ bo je@@ t ?
we &apos;re going to move even further down , and go to one single electr@@ on spin .
they spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing fo@@ ods that kids shouldn &apos;t eat for every one dollar marketing healthy , nutri@@ tious food .
and when one does that , one really changes the economics of deli@@ ver@@ ing compu@@ tational things , whether it &apos;s on the web or elsewhere .
one minute ?
not only that , i compared &#91; it to &#93; the entire spectrum .
and then we can form , in effect , a mes@@ h network .
the fo@@ under of 4@@ ch@@ an , a contro@@ versi@@ al , un@@ cen@@ sor@@ ed online ima@@ ge@@ board , describes its sub@@ culture , some of the internet &quot; memes &quot; it has launched , and the inci@@ dent in which its users managed a very public , pre@@ c@@ ision h@@ ack of a ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am media website . the talk rais@@ es questions about the power -- and price -- of an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity .
there &apos;s an old cell@@ phone in there -- a good use for old cell@@ phones -- which di@@ als the clin@@ ic , we go and pick up the mouse .
so they actually swit@@ ched to leaving some of the micro@@ bial community in the ile@@ um . they leave the mic@@ rob@@ es with the don@@ or , and theore@@ tically that might help the people who are recei@@ ving this ile@@ al transp@@ l@@ ant .
em : i did build rock@@ ets when i was a kid , but i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be involved in this .
when you t@@ oss a co@@ in , you get a sequence of heads and ta@@ ils .
we want to fold up the legs and sho@@ ot it up for long-@@ range motion .
soon it started to bring results .
this is where i come from , to@@ d@@ mor@@ den .
there &apos;s a basic equ@@ ation that we can &apos;t get away from .
&quot; research described a woman with cap@@ gras syndro@@ me who compla@@ ined about her poor@@ ly en@@ do@@ wed and sex@@ ually in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate lo@@ ver . &quot;
you know the pi@@ rate tri@@ be is a fascinating one .
i &apos;m trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period .
in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about ra@@ cial at@@ titu@@ des .
du@@ st@@ y and i , we like to say , on sun@@ day , this is where we go to church .
these people like better the one they own , but they don &apos;t know they own it .
and i was also really interested in wireless as well .
if you can see this or@@ ange tree , it &apos;s actually growing in a car ti@@ re , which has been turned inside out and se@@ wn up .
in our brain@@ storms , we came up with the idea you could use it for a soc@@ cer goal : so at the end of the game , you just roll up the goal and put it in your gy@@ m ba@@ g .
it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work , and it was used in a project where we could un@@ ra@@ vel that surface , and it was a fig@@ ur@@ ative idea that was going to be fol@@ ded and made into a very , kind of complex space .
we talk about world peace .
you know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the her@@ o is not afraid .
no , you must really understand that .
now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
this is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
maybe there &apos;s fewer accidents , so there &apos;s public health benefits .
so , hea@@ v@@ ens ! what was i to do ? i no longer required the sticks ; i wasn &apos;t allowed to have these sticks .
there &apos;s lots of electronics and secret sau@@ ce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it .
so , we can use these smart biom@@ ateri@@ als but only for about one centi@@ meter to bridge those g@@ aps .
so if we add in a chimpanze@@ e here , we will see more differences .
and there , we sat down , and we did a de@@ brief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
but i can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
and when you look at what we &apos;re using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transpor@@ tation fuel .
please raise your hand -- oh , that &apos;s a lot .
the first is this : that china is not really a nation@@ -@@ state .
all across the glo@@ be , you have this tendency of men wan@@ ting a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
i mean , they compla@@ in about it all the time .
the alternative is that civili@@ zations don &apos;t last very long , but destro@@ y themselves .
but she &apos;d become ade@@ pt at dod@@ ging the boys in blue , and when she did meet them , oh , she had wonderful , well , r@@ app@@ ort .
that &apos;s been a strong interest of mine , and a theme that i &apos;ve developed for some 30 years .
the storm was so fi@@ er@@ ce that we had to la@@ y , fully dres@@ sed , fully equi@@ pped , la@@ id out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blo@@ wing off the mountain .
actually , i come from punk rock .
and mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot;
it was a photograph , not of spac@@ e-@@ time , but of an ec@@ li@@ p@@ se , with a do@@ t there rather than there .
&quot; she was running away . what else was i suppose to do ? &quot;
so it &apos;s a little bit like &quot; star wars , &quot; you know , but it &apos;s real .
this ju@@ dge is someone you &apos;d never want to play po@@ ker with .
this is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- it is the fin@@ ning of sharks .
we fly about a mile above the surface .
it paraly@@ zes you . it starts by killing the motor neurons in your spin@@ al cor@@ d .
this is an area today that has very few regu@@ lations and even fewer rules .
soli@@ di@@ fying into surface , mol@@ ded by fire .
n@@ ell is interested in agri@@ cultural process@@ es , and her work is based in these practic@@ es .
he &apos;d r@@ ans@@ ac@@ ked , des@@ ec@@ rated the temp@@ le .
boy : on the day of judg@@ ment , god will ask me , &quot; why did you do that ? &quot;
i &apos;ve always been fascinated by the indu@@ s scri@@ pt ever since i read about it in a middle school text@@ book .
we carry in our face the pro@@ of that cooking , food transformation , made us what we are .
p@@ m : so how large is the collection ?
it &apos;s a ro@@ unding er@@ ror on the fe@@ der@@ al side .
sort of e@@ a@@ ves@@ drop on the activity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
i told him one of the reasons that his un@@ cle was remem@@ ber@@ ed is because he said we &apos;re going to send a man to the moon , and we &apos;ll do it by the end of the decade .
the gang leader always got paid , ok ?
that &apos;s it -- that should get you right there .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tail@@ bone ?
you get 2@@ 2@@ 3@@ ,000 hits -- no results you can use .
what if all the re@@ plac@@ ements our bodies need already exist in nature , or within our own stem cells ?
so , you see different var@@ ie@@ ties of chinese food .
and i thought to myself , wouldn &apos;t it be great if i had my own do@@ do skelet@@ on ?
think of how the world can be a much better place if , for a change , we have a better equ@@ ality , we have equ@@ ality , we have a repres@@ entation and we understand war , both from the fron@@ t-@@ line and the back@@ -@@ line discussion .
they turned a cha@@ ir from something the pur@@ chasing department bought , to something that was a status symbo@@ l about where you sat at work .
now in terms of the un@@ know@@ ns , there are many .
your blood tries to bo@@ il . it &apos;s called v@@ ap@@ ori@@ zation .
by their attra@@ ction to wind far@@ ms . again , right now bat@@ s are looking at a little bit of a problem .
and at that period it was -- in a way , a number of things were happening .
and my pain is being rel@@ ie@@ ved . &quot; ok ?
now , there &apos;s a history of this in science and before i tell you what it is , i &apos;m going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science .
japan here was regar@@ ded as an exc@@ eption .
that &apos;s an ad@@ ult or@@ in@@ oc@@ o cro@@ co@@ di@@ le in its ja@@ ws .
and i think that this is all part of sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to the design journey .
have you met anyone interesting ?
we actually write it only to set our at@@ titu@@ des right .
for someone who &apos;s done a lot of counter@@ terror@@ ism work , i can &apos;t ex@@ to@@ l to you how great having something bu@@ ried below the ground is for pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation and security concer@@ ns .
but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells .
about 20 years ago , i was in south africa working with the par@@ ties in that conflict , and i had an extra month , so i spent some time living with several groups of san bus@@ hmen .
right ? this is simple physics .
i could not believe .
a child who doesn &apos;t know his or her colors or doesn &apos;t know how to tell time , doesn &apos;t know how to tie sho@@ es , doesn &apos;t know how to do those things , and doesn &apos;t know how to do something that goes by a word that was dri@@ ll@@ ed into me as a kid : mind .
they &apos;re highly imag@@ in@@ ative .
if you said to a modern liberal individu@@ al@@ ist , &quot; hey , how about a ser@@ m@@ on ? &quot;
it &apos;s a pretty quick read .
you know , there are a hundred types of br@@ us@@ hes .
you know , as an anthrop@@ ologist , walking is what made us human .
they &apos;re often quite brief . they &apos;re often very seas@@ on@@ ally constra@@ ined .
so , yes , you can lose weight , but your heart isn &apos;t happy .
for example , if , in that bu@@ ck@@ y-@@ inspired p@@ hr@@ ase , we draw back and we look at planet earth , and we take a kind of typical , industri@@ alized society , then the energy consum@@ ed would be spli@@ t between the buildings , 44 percent , transport , 34 percent , and industry .
that guy &apos;s been on the road probably for the last half hour .
and what happens is that , at first , people start off reason@@ ably cooperative -- and this is all played an@@ on@@ ym@@ ously .
traditional no@@ tions of management are great if you want compli@@ ance .
so to close , my teacher , mr. v@@ ut@@ ter , told me that physics is cool , and hopefully , i &apos;ve convinced you that physics can teach all of us , even in the world of marketing , something special .
she pass@@ es that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time -- as the red@@ wood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
now , just in case you &apos;re not getting it , here &apos;s a sch@@ ema@@ tic of what happened , ok ?
i was so happy .
and not only that , but it helps us bro@@ aden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there -- life that could be very different from life that we find here on earth .
look at this , 2@@ ,000 people almost , on cop@@ ax@@ one .
people ha@@ te it .
there &apos;s simply no economic model that that would be possible .
dan@@ i@@ elle de ni@@ ese : a fli@@ r@@ ta@@ tious aria
and somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming .
i was be@@ aten by my hus@@ band for five years .
three years ago , she ent@@ ered the no@@ vo@@ cure lung cancer trial .
and we think , at least in this pr@@ el@@ im@@ in@@ ary -- it &apos;s one study ; it &apos;s probably wrong , but it &apos;s one study -- we think that at least a reason@@ able hypo@@ thesis is that , to be creative , you have to have this weird dis@@ soci@@ ation in your fron@@ tal lo@@ be .
this object was made by a hom@@ in@@ id an@@ c@@ est@@ or , homo erec@@ tus or homo er@@ ga@@ ster , between 5@@ 0,000 and 100,000 years before language .
and you can see two la@@ yers of fi@@ bers , one in blue and one in yellow , ar@@ ran@@ ged in le@@ ft-@@ hand@@ ed and ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand@@ ed an@@ gl@@ es .
we don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
but there is also a passionate commit@@ ment to the truth .
the leaves of the te@@ a , plu@@ cked from the bus@@ hes ; you know what the action is ? the action is : the la@@ dy pi@@ cks up a few leaves , puts them in the bas@@ ke@@ t on the back@@ side .
and i said , &quot; thank you for being here . &quot;
we take our money and we give it away .
the moment i stopped , half a dozen other people immediately rin@@ ged the same guy .
but having been born in es@@ sex , at the age of 16 , i joined an organization .

so with that , i &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geo@@ graphy always matters .
what this is doing is , we find a -- a dire@@ ct colli@@ sion -- we find a dire@@ ct colli@@ sion between avail@@ ability -- and what &apos;s possible through avail@@ ability -- and a fundamental human need -- which we &apos;ve been hearing about a lot , actually -- the need to create shared narra@@ tives .
a doctor might be serious , but lau@@ gh@@ ter &apos;s still a great medicine .

they were evolved by nature in order to get a j@@ ell@@ yfish to g@@ low green for whatever reason , or in order to detect the code prot@@ ein of an inv@@ ading virus , for example .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gather@@ ing in cities .
at the top are mathematics and languages , then the human@@ i@@ ties , and the bottom are the arts .
so , the department of health in new york came to us , and they needed a way to distribu@@ te 3@@ 6 million con@@ dom@@ s for free to the citizens of new york .
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a clos@@ ing thought .
but what it means is that we fail to identi@@ fy a gre@@ as@@ y po@@ cket in these proteins , into which we , like molecu@@ lar lo@@ ck@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug substance .
but as you look at it , i hope you &apos;ll begin to feel just slightly un@@ easy .
even more interesting to me is that 600 vol@@ ts doesn &apos;t fr@@ y it .

ok ? and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone .
think about the possibility , why is it that i@@ phones and i@@ pa@@ ds adv@@ ance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family ?
so when the audio home recording act of 199@@ 2 was passed , the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distin@@ ctions for cop@@ ying because it was clear that if con@@ gress was ac@@ ting in their framework , they might actually increase the rights of citizens to partici@@ pate in our own media environment .
there &apos;s the not@@ -@@ glam@@ or@@ ous version of what it looks like today , after a few cent@@ uries .

this isn &apos;t easy stuff .

so we are pur@@ su@@ ing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
basically , i want to end with my vision for africa , you know ?
we bl@@ ast the air condi@@ tioning the entire way , and we never experience over@@ he@@ ating .
people often cre@@ dit their ideas to individual &quot; eu@@ re@@ ka ! &quot; moments . but steven john@@ son shows how history tells a different story . his fascinating tour takes us from the &quot; li@@ qu@@ id networks &quot; of london &apos;s coffee houses to charles darwin &apos;s long , slow hun@@ ch to today &apos;s high-@@ vel@@ o@@ city web .
but the second part of it -- and the older i get , the more convinced i am that that &apos;s true .
they &apos;ve lived in ital@@ y for a number of years .
so i said , okay .
not@@ with@@ standing the fact that the building , as a green building , is very much a pion@@ e@@ ering building .
and these were all no@@ vi@@ ces , and they built something that was really quite ug@@ ly -- nothing like a fro@@ g or a c@@ ran@@ e .
but it makes an incredible band@@ -@@ aid .
and second , that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world .
what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
some people don &apos;t . and if we like them , we &apos;ve got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
the great des@@ car@@ tes said something quite similar .
so ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly it &apos;s a cur@@ ren@@ cy at the moment that &apos;s pur@@ ely for the kind@@ le .
little kids couldn &apos;t eat off the sal@@ ad bar , big kids would sp@@ it in it -- nei@@ ther happened .
like , you can feel inten@@ se pleas@@ ure and some others around you can be suffering a lot .
and the result is kind of a tree of life of these vir@@ uses , a phy@@ lo@@ gen@@ y that looks very much like the type of life that we &apos;re used to , at least on the vi@@ ral level .
in fact , often , as we &apos;ve seen happen in a lot of the ar@@ ab spring revol@@ ts , often those di@@ visi@@ ons are along religious lines .

and hey , surprise , very high rates of hiv among people who are in@@ je@@ cting drugs .
it &apos;s time to start designing for our e@@ ars .
and what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the high@@ est form of stuff ?
we can get effici@@ ency up .
and we can see what the relationship is between those two things .
it &apos;s because it shows off our econom@@ ies , shows off our cur@@ ren@@ cies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build , including businesses .
and all of these robo@@ tic mis@@ sions are part of a bigger human journey : a vo@@ y@@ age to understand something , to get a sense of our cos@@ mic place , to understand something of our origins , and how earth , our planet , and we , living on it , came to be .
so typ@@ ically , small ma@@ mm@@ als live fast , die young .
when we look at this new uni@@ fied pattern , we can see a couple of g@@ aps where particles seem to be missing .
i want you to make it .
it &apos;s right here .
i want to introduce you to a good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa &apos;s biggest sh@@ ant@@ y@@ town .
he says , &quot; we need more bo@@ ots on the ground in afghanistan . &quot;
and they have to be in all possi@@ bilities , including those i never consi@@ dered before .
he was a midd@@ le-@@ class guy .
you just have to stru@@ t . &quot;
or they men@@ tion cu@@ be roots or ask me to reci@@ te a long number or long text .
again , not a single one of them -- i think there are about seven or eight of them -- thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
they would have to film us from a really long distance by hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and then have a really long l@@ ens , and we would see ourselves , on tv , pa@@ sting .
it looks like there are ri@@ vers on it , there are oceans or la@@ kes , we know there are clouds . we think it &apos;s ra@@ ining also on it .
i re@@ sted for a day at home .
september 11@@ th created a security model in a lot of people &apos;s heads .
a study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies c@@ ry in the ac@@ cent of their mother &apos;s native language .
so , we believe that in those regi@@ ons of the world where the population is large , and there &apos;s an infrastructure that can provide it , that a local , inte@@ gr@@ ated , en@@ d-@@ to-@@ end system is really critical for its success .
so i went to google earth and learned about africa .
and in the mri and m@@ r spec@@ tr@@ os@@ copy here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it di@@ min@@ ishing after a year .
you find these , for example , in fish oil .
but just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
and what i &apos;d like to argu@@ e is that that &apos;s not necessarily the case , as progress is simply a word for change , and with change you ga@@ in something , but you also lose something .
every technology advan@@ ces .
then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a d@@ warf .
so , doing these arti@@ ficial life experiments helps us defin@@ e a potential path between non-@@ living and living systems .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
hi , my name is mar@@ cin -- far@@ mer , technolog@@ ist .
now the chinese example shows us several points .
you will have come in cont@@ act with some of them .
they &apos;ve passed the wrong piece of leg@@ is@@ lation . whatever it is .
this has inspired the design of the first self-@@ clean@@ ing dry ad@@ h@@ esi@@ ve -- the pat@@ ent issu@@ ed , we &apos;re happy to say .
so he is one of five kids .
and unfortunately , i can be a little too honest .
m@@ r : i wasn &apos;t suggesting that i was going to go and do it , but ...
thank you very much .
because if your city is designed around cars , it &apos;s really good at sm@@ ash@@ ing them into each other .
and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is de@@ aling with people fairly and well , and i like to think that &apos;s how we run virg@@ in .
kb : good decision .
you actually have to con@@ vey about 10 different charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs while you &apos;re standing up there .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call our war@@ e@@ houses for hope .
so then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking tam@@ i@@ flu ?
but in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repe@@ ated in the lower 48 .
and just these little things .
so what do we call this ?
no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who &apos;s got his hands around that mess , ok .
what does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?
so we did an experiment .
so we &apos;ve done that all over the eastern pac@@ i@@ fic .
it &apos;s not that complicated .
and the government , they heard her story and the other people , and they said , &quot; yeah , you &apos;re right , we should make a law .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical cap@@ abilities improve .
the dog is actually eu@@ th@@ ani@@ zed now , but this was a dog i worked with for a while .
it &apos;s 2@@ 8 percent in organ don@@ ation .
because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consu@@ me this .
this is a ru@@ ben@@ s &apos; tube . it &apos;s one of many i &apos;ve made over the years , and i have one here tonight .
they recently sequ@@ enced pin@@ ot no@@ ir , and it also has about 30,000 genes , so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolu@@ tionary order of any particular species .
there &apos;s a whole range of innova@@ tions that we have .
i mean look , you can see the ne@@ ck@@ tie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small at@@ om .
what would that mean ?
one day where we had cal@@ m seas and sun , which was the reason i could get off the ship .
but if you haven &apos;t played with a battery and a bul@@ b , if you &apos;ve only seen a circu@@ it diag@@ ram , you might not be able to do that , and that &apos;s one of the problems .
and ever since , i &apos;ve been walking the my@@ stic path , trying to pe@@ er beyond what al@@ bert einstein called &quot; the op@@ tical del@@ usion of everyday consciousness . &quot;
and this gap was finally filled by an en@@ han@@ ced version of the big bang theory .
and we te@@ sted this by ex@@ pos@@ ing american babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to mandar@@ in for the first time during the critical period .
and i wouldn &apos;t want to go to ban@@ gal@@ ore . let me stay here .
dh : all right , let &apos;s show them something special .
we say it becomes more str@@ ong@@ ly stra@@ ti@@ fied .
and what do you know ? six months later , my school and my kids were a@@ war@@ ded the first ever high school a@@ ward of excell@@ ence for creating a healthy school environment .
and if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ tch their ne@@ cks out .
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
but i think we &apos;re looking for something more .
using google earth you can wit@@ ness tra@@ w@@ lers -- in china , the north sea , the gulf of mexico -- sha@@ king the foundation of our life support system , leaving plum@@ es of death in their path .
it &apos;s a form@@ at that died because it wasn &apos;t useful enough .
they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time .
the space age began 50 years ago in oc@@ to@@ ber , and that &apos;s exactly what sputnik looked like .
and everybody &apos;s dogs at home have an auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal self to a certain degree .
cisco actually estim@@ ates that , within four years , more than 90 percent of the web &apos;s data will be video .
the dalai lama was once in por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere .
and when they finally hand you hear@@ ta@@ che , when they sli@@ p war and hat@@ red under your door and offer you hand@@ ou@@ ts on stre@@ et@@ -@@ cor@@ ners of cy@@ nic@@ ism and de@@ fe@@ at , you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother .
i speak as an auth@@ ority on that subject , because i &apos;m an extreme case .
i happened to be living in spr@@ ing@@ field at the time , and the best part of it was -- is that -- you would close the women &apos;s door in the ba@@ th@@ room , and i remember seeing &quot; go so@@ x , &quot; and i thought , really ?
and one of the thoughts that i had de@@ aling with these two separate emergen@@ ces of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought , when i was still kind of in the apart@@ ment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building , was that i &apos;d made a terrible mis@@ calcu@@ lation in the book that i &apos;d just written .
that code is there underneath the en@@ cr@@ y@@ ption as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
now fast forward to just three years ago .
i have a play@@ list of about 85 songs , and especially in the middle of the night , and that night , because we use no lights -- lights attra@@ ct j@@ ell@@ yfish , lights attra@@ ct sharks , lights attra@@ ct ba@@ it@@ fish that attra@@ ct sharks , so we go in the pit@@ ch black of the night .
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held abo@@ ard the lin@@ d@@ bla@@ d explor@@ er in the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos as part of the ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment of sylvia ear@@ le &apos;s ted wish .
i don &apos;t have to tell you this .
can you do it ?
now here we go in to the -- la la la , off to work .
my life became about getting rid of it and ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ing about getting rid of it .
you &apos;re going to get it eventually . i have faith in you .
think of the cell as a hardware . think of the genes as a software . and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is inter@@ chan@@ ge@@ able , that can become energy , that can become food , that can become fi@@ ber , that can become human beings , that can become a whole series of things , then you &apos;ve got to shi@@ ft your approach as to how you &apos;re going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way .
so security is two different things : it &apos;s a feeling , and it &apos;s a reality .
the visi@@ bility &apos;s 600 ft . ; we &apos;re on our safety lines ; the ice is moving all over the place .
&quot; for two minutes , &quot; you say , &quot; i want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot;
the reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity .
and that business is agriculture .
and they &apos;ve ended up on a bunch of talk shows , and they &apos;ve used it as an opportunity to make a difference .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndro@@ me more clearly and earlier in pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate those pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cies , or to ter@@ min@@ ate them .
and what i was curious about -- because histor@@ ically , the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wa@@ sted -- and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .
i do , but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that i &apos;ve just been as@@ suming are s@@ ac@@ ros@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not .
i know that li@@ p@@ stick means more than show , and boys are super inse@@ cure , and so@@ -@@ called terrori@@ sts are made , not born .
just like fear offers us prote@@ ctive benefits , dis@@ g@@ ust seems to do the same thing , except for what dis@@ g@@ ust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us , or hei@@ ghts , but rather things that might po@@ is@@ on us , or give us disease and make us sick .
but what really , i think , makes the high line special is the people .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully conver@@ ting fear into hope .
we actually went off to make a book@@ mobile .
the remarkable thing to us is that , when you give mon@@ keys this choice , they do the same ir@@ rational thing that people do .
i went around toronto and found a ba@@ th@@ tu@@ b like my grandmother &apos;s , and i put the fish in .
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
a very small amount of money would get us some .
i thought i knew what fear was .
it &apos;s not just in economics , but it &apos;s also in terms of living standards .
we have to send the fa@@ thers to de-@@ addi@@ ction lab@@ s and when they come back , most times so@@ ber , we have to find a job for them so that they don &apos;t re@@ gress .
and you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these boo@@ by tr@@ aps .
i put my friends in j@@ ars , i put this character , this sort of endangered species character in a bl@@ ender .
and this was the 196@@ 0s when actually all the streets in this neighbor@@ hood were named after con@@ fe@@ der@@ ate war gener@@ als .
i &apos;ll give you one of them .
did you know that data exi@@ sted ?
or take the in@@ famous verse about killing the unbelie@@ vers .
they just move back to the mid-@@ east and those come back .
it is vital that the ideas that are nur@@ tured in ted , that the ideas that we think about look forward , and make sure that this will be the most gl@@ ori@@ ous century , and not one of e@@ co-@@ disaster and e@@ co-@@ collap@@ se .
i wanted to figure out how to maxi@@ mi@@ ze my own profile online .
but the point is that what happens once you start kind of quie@@ tly le@@ an@@ ing back ?
there &apos;s now ample evidence that har@@ dy ro@@ den@@ stock is a c@@ on man , and that the je@@ ff@@ er@@ son bott@@ les were fa@@ kes .
margaret g@@ ould stewart : how youtube thinks about copyright
you can &apos;t focus on what you &apos;re supposed to do .
and that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
i came up with the idea of painting shado@@ ws .
when this result was first published , it was highly contro@@ versi@@ al .
i &apos;m not at all against education .
there &apos;s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn &apos;t sound good to you .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were rein@@ vent@@ ing char@@ ity in those times , what rock@@ ef@@ eller called &quot; the business of ben@@ evol@@ ence . &quot;
i &apos;m better able to focus on my goals and dre@@ ams .
so , what it says to me then is that it &apos;s not really -- the problem isn &apos;t really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told , the problem really is the terms of humanity that we &apos;re willing to bring to comp@@ licate every story , and that &apos;s really what it &apos;s all about .
dr. y@@ un@@ us shared his story , expla@@ ining what that was , and what he had done with his gram@@ e@@ en bank .
but to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
so , we &apos;ve invented ourselves . of all the animals that we have dom@@ esti@@ cated , the most important animal that we &apos;ve dom@@ esti@@ cated has been us . okay ?
that paper was repor@@ ted on the front page of the new york times and led to me te@@ sti@@ fying to con@@ gress in the 19@@ 80 &apos;s , te@@ stim@@ ony in which i em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed that global warming increas@@ es both extre@@ mes of the earth &apos;s water cycle .
you know , i was born in brazil and grew up in the &apos; 7@@ 0s under a climate of political dist@@ ress , and i was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a se@@ mi@@ o@@ tic black market .
&quot; that is to say , your thoughts and words fli@@ t and dar@@ t , dis@@ concer@@ ted@@ ly el@@ u@@ sive at times , but when caught and exam@@ ined -- a@@ h@@ h , such a wonder , such a del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful re@@ ward .
now , i talked to paul afterwards .
it &apos;s not a happy thought , but your kids could get mix@@ ed up in gangs or bad sc@@ en@@ es .
i started out by trying to figure out what roman@@ tic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psych@@ ological research -- and as it turns out , there &apos;s a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love .
because they may turn out to be a majority .
you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wi@@ sh@@ es .

this is working with mar@@ shall m@@ clu@@ han .
and one in particular that you probably wouldn &apos;t know about , stro@@ ke , which has been , along with heart disease , one of the biggest kill@@ ers in this country , is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergen@@ cy room within three hours of the on@@ set , some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any dis@@ ability what@@ so@@ ever .
and there i am . this is a quite high-@@ powered x-@@ ray machine .
i &apos;ll play this until your e@@ ye@@ b@@ alls completely dis@@ solve .
i &apos;m here to talk to you about solutions .
if we can have mars ro@@ vers , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
there you go . 70 cab@@ in@@ et mini@@ sters , 11@@ 4 pres@@ identi@@ al ad@@ vis@@ ers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .

well , if that &apos;s the case , good . why hard instead of easy ?
with four , you make a square , you make a p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , you make a h@@ ex@@ ag@@ on , you make all these kind of pol@@ yg@@ ons .
and i said , i &apos;ll go in from the biological side .
that &apos;s not really what i mean .

this was the myth@@ ology of the g@@ ym@@ n@@ osop@@ h@@ ist .
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; i was here , &quot; on the top of a building .

by the way , tony ha@@ y@@ ward , the former ce@@ o of b@@ p , had a pla@@ que on his des@@ k in@@ scri@@ bed with this inspi@@ rational slo@@ gan : &quot; what would you attemp@@ t to do if you knew you could not fail ? &quot;
the universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe .
you &apos;re also running a civil society .
so you take them out , you put them in a dis@@ h , they don &apos;t make mil@@ k . they completely forget .
you &apos;ll say , &quot; how can we trust them ? &quot;
for my second project , i have a sen@@ sa@@ tional idea of a jum@@ p that never has been done before .
it &apos;s bad history .
and i &apos;m following all the light ki@@ cks on this thing and making sure that as i &apos;m holding the light in the same position , i &apos;m getting the same type of refle@@ ction on it -- that &apos;s the level of detail i &apos;m going into this thing .
so we could show the fir@@ ing rate of that neur@@ on as a function of the animal &apos;s location .
will i not make enough money ?
but a second way to cra@@ ck the code is to develop some technology , an interface to do two-@@ way communication , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been trying to do in the ba@@ ham@@ as and in real time .
the as@@ per@@ ger guy . and if you were to get rid of all the autis@@ m genetics there would be no more si@@ lic@@ on valley , and the energy crisis would not be solved .
the distribu@@ ted foot , actually , is working more like a p@@ add@@ le .

because our e@@ go@@ cent@@ ric perception -- from the buddha &apos;s point of view , mis@@ perception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin .
so what you see is nothing but shado@@ w of a shado@@ w of a shado@@ w .
you know ?
so , why not look ? of course , it &apos;s not very likely that there &apos;s life on the surface of europa .
this is another case where a theore@@ tical para@@ dig@@ m in biology really worked -- was the ger@@ m theory of disease .
if we want to encoura@@ ge change of behavior , g@@ all@@ ons per mile would have far more effec@@ ti@@ veness .
the people who belie@@ ved in the wright bro@@ thers &apos; dream worked with them with blood and swe@@ at and te@@ ars .
now you might find copyright math strange , but that &apos;s because it &apos;s a field that &apos;s best left to exper@@ ts .
we use now some type of technologies , where for soli@@ d organ@@ s , for example , like the li@@ ver , what we do is we take disc@@ ard li@@ vers .
so , what &apos;s the future ?
and he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to introduce you to tony . &quot;
so clearly this animal knows where it &apos;s going and it knows where it wants to go , and that &apos;s a very , very important thing , because if you think about it , you &apos;re at the dung pi@@ le , you &apos;ve got this great big p@@ ie that you want to get away from everybody else , and the quick@@ est way to do it is in a straight line .
he said , &quot; no , no , no , you know this phan@@ tom i &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
here we go . wh@@ o@@ a ! it &apos;s magne@@ tic . it doesn &apos;t pull the laptop onto the floor .
and then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into africa , and we would still have the same problems .
the whole thing has the struc@@ tural value of cor@@ n .

if it has a subject , the subject is adol@@ escence .
each trip was an ex@@ cur@@ sion , was an ad@@ venture .
and there &apos;s a day &apos;s worth of our cu@@ ps .
what we &apos;ve discovered is you have to give them flowers and sun@@ light and food and expec@@ tations and herb@@ ie &apos;s music , and you can cure a spiritu@@ al cancer every time .
as you can see , a project evol@@ ves through a series of generations of design me@@ etings .
that &apos;s really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land .

i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we &apos;ve lost -- actually , we &apos;ve taken , we &apos;ve e@@ aten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral re@@ ef@@ s have dis@@ appeared ; why a my@@ steri@@ ous de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in large areas of the pac@@ i@@ fic should conc@@ ern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should conc@@ ern you .

i cover my life@@ time here , you know ?
the reason he called me leon@@ ardo is because we were in europe and he was practic@@ ing his french .
because , if the board of direc@@ tors convin@@ ce everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely depen@@ dent on the decisions made by the board of direc@@ tors , it makes the dis@@ par@@ ity in sal@@ ari@@ es slightly more justi@@ fi@@ able than if you actually ac@@ knowledge that quite a lot of the cre@@ dit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tac@@ tical activity .

so , i took 15 different li@@ sts from key thin@@ kers , like the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia britanni@@ ca , the museum of natural history , car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s cos@@ mic cal@@ en@@ dar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point ; these were just li@@ sts in re@@ ference works , and i think that &apos;s what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution .
but i don &apos;t know that that &apos;s the common debate .
and there are those individuals who have incredible arti@@ stic abilities .
and a few years ago , we received these results .
thank you very much .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer dete@@ cted -- had her l@@ um@@ pe@@ c@@ tom@@ y in the town in which i lived .
now it is not surprising that with this massi@@ fication and lar@@ ge-@@ scale production , there is a counter@@ -@@ movement that emer@@ ged -- very much also here in california .
as an indian , and now as a politi@@ cian and a government minister , i &apos;ve become rather concerned about the hy@@ pe we &apos;re hearing about our own country , all this talk about india becoming a world leader , even the next super@@ power .
we just need to put it together .
it &apos;s about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
otherwise , it was nei@@ ther s@@ ini@@ ster n@@ or dist@@ ur@@ bing , although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emo@@ tions , particularly emo@@ tions which were remote and in@@ accessi@@ ble .
therefore india is at a critical point where either it can le@@ verage its demographic divi@@ den@@ d or it can lead to a demographic disaster .
i love the way that they &apos;ll spend hours pi@@ cking d@@ and@@ el@@ i@@ ons in the back@@ y@@ ard and putting them into a nice cent@@ er@@ piece for than@@ ks@@ giving dinner .
you put all those together , and you &apos;ve got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back .
and again , they only absor@@ b light at particular colors when electr@@ ons jum@@ p up and fall down , jum@@ p up and fall down .
this time you can have three words .
and i &apos;m here to say that i think that that is the wrong sum@@ mit of the pyram@@ id ...
that means there &apos;s literally thousands of new ideas .
so , this is the planet that the player evolved on .
we need to give to others to be successful .
they are just discover@@ ing .
because obviously it &apos;s making a com@@ ment about our culture right now : that we can &apos;t tell what &apos;s real .
there is a great story , again , told about richard ni@@ x@@ on .
sort of lea@@ der@@ ship by hu@@ mili@@ ation .
so do sea tur@@ t@@ les .
so we &apos;re talking about se@@ ctors like home hair care , the hi@@ re of toys , farm work , hi@@ re of clothes even , me@@ als delivered to your door , services for tou@@ ri@@ sts , home care .
every single thing that every single person who &apos;s ever played in a game has ever done can be measu@@ red .
so in one level it went from something like 13 dollars to 2@@ 66 , literally in the space of four months , and then crash@@ ed and lost half of its value in six hours .
the last sister stood up and said , &quot; i &apos;m also positive .
can you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
by 20@@ 15 , there will be more people in the united states over the age of 60 than under 15 .
they scri@@ be along a place there .
it has to support over 100 million users at any given moment . it &apos;s got to be robust to attack , including clos@@ ing the main inde@@ x , in@@ je@@ cting mali@@ cious fil@@ es , ar@@ med sei@@ z@@ ure of some major no@@ des . you &apos;d say that would take years .
then , they spra@@ yed stem cells onto that heart , from a mouse .
so i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ll leave it here for two months .
but then , to fin@@ ish with a plu@@ g for all the good and mira@@ cul@@ ous bacteria that live on the earth , we &apos;ve also made pro@@ -@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing molecules .
it was sold to pro@@ to-@@ femin@@ ist house@@ wi@@ ves as a way to cut down on house@@ work .
i said , &quot; well , he &apos;s passed away , but his name was k@@ hos@@ r@@ o . &quot;
my wife said , &quot; yeah , right , si@@ t-@@ ins in the mor@@ tu@@ ary .
it &apos;s the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning .
we were like a mini@@ ature united nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regar@@ ds to a nation or a religion , took place .
thank you .
i felt that if i could manage without medi@@ cation , i could prove that , after all , i wasn &apos;t really ment@@ ally ill , it was some terrible mista@@ ke .
he depen@@ ds , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
and then you need to add some more por@@ ts , and more .
so that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try -- this is how not to learn wire walking .
and at the same time , i &apos;m listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are .
so there you go . that &apos;s the truth .
the last image we don &apos;t have .
so that &apos;s the part of the brain that is activ@@ ated when you give a word to something .
after a year the ones from japan are head@@ ing straight across the pac@@ i@@ fic , while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the la@@ titu@@ de of cab@@ o san lu@@ c@@ as .
mars has the largest vol@@ can@@ o in the solar system , ol@@ ym@@ pu@@ s mon@@ s .
the neur@@ on uses its natural prot@@ ein@@ -@@ making machin@@ ery to fabri@@ c@@ ate these little ligh@@ t-@@ sensitive proteins and inst@@ all them all over the cell , like putting solar panels on a ro@@ of , and the next thing you know , you have a neur@@ on which can be activ@@ ated with light .
it was , remark@@ ably , a pretty good so@@ unding room .
with the significance being these fun@@ ds have come in as a q@@ t capital , not as gr@@ ant or as phil@@ anthrop@@ y .
i mean , reality is what you can see .
that &apos;s so true .
religion doesn &apos;t have a mon@@ op@@ ol@@ y on that , but there are pl@@ enty of religious ko@@ o@@ ks .
e : i love you .
and after some time , we developed a low-@@ cost press that allows you to produce char@@ coal , which actually now bur@@ ns longer , clean@@ er than wood char@@ coal .
i like to build stuff .
to con@@ clu@@ de , i mean , what we do , does it have a bro@@ ader relev@@ ance , or is it just india or developing countries ?
in@@ jury crash@@ es have dropped 7@@ 6 percent , f@@ at@@ al crash@@ es down 90 percent .
and you &apos;ve heard so many in@@ spir@@ ing stories here , and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine .
together , for our future . &quot;
being run over is never easy .
and then , &quot; be ob@@ sc@@ ure clearly ! be wild of ton@@ gue in a way we can understand . &quot;
its origins are fir@@ m@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed in the analo@@ g age .
i think the logic goes something like this : if we don &apos;t expect great@@ ness , if we don &apos;t expect to find love and be healthy and successful , well we &apos;re not going to be dis@@ ap@@ pointed when these things don &apos;t happen .
i think what we &apos;re going to see is we &apos;re going to see a different species of hom@@ in@@ id .
but , at the same time you don &apos;t want to get so focused on rule number two , or goal number two , that you ne@@ gle@@ ct goal number one .
e@@ ve ens@@ ler : embra@@ ce your inner girl
every 4@@ 3 seconds a child in africa dies ; 27 will die during my talk .
i &apos;m sorry if i put that idea in your head .
we then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them .
the other thing you need to know about sh@@ ame is it &apos;s absolutely organized by gender .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
em : exactly . what it amo@@ unts to is a giant distribu@@ ted u@@ tili@@ ty .
anyway , i know chris told us not to do pit@@ ches up here , but since i have all of your attention : we need inv@@ e@@ stors . end of pit@@ ch .
and we know this based on the machines that are being placed .
again , coming back to that thing about the li@@ fest@@ yle , and in a way , the ec@@ ological agenda is very much at one with the spirit .
but that day , it occurred to me : what if that gram@@ mar is nothing more than a self-@@ ser@@ ving conc@@ eit ?
the red em@@ b@@ lem of michael looked as if it could fly .
i spent the year working with children who were training to become su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bom@@ bers and with taliban rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ers , trying to understand how the taliban were conver@@ ting these children into live am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion and why these children were ac@@ tively sig@@ ning up to their cause .
so with deep hu@@ mili@@ ty , and for your appro@@ val , we present &quot; clou@@ d@@ bur@@ st . &quot;
i really thank you for your time .
of course , child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it &apos;s under@@ u@@ tili@@ zed .
the out@@ come , immedi@@ ate .
now those are all goals which could be achie@@ ved within a decade , but only with radi@@ cal and systema@@ tic experiment , not just with technologies , but also with li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and culture and poli@@ cies and institutions too .
they &apos;re going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the im@@ f .
these rin@@ ged se@@ als also live out their entire life cycle associ@@ ated and connected to sea ice .
you could just about go to war and that was about it .
but that day i fle@@ w low over the islands -- it was a family trip to the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an , and i fle@@ w in a small plane low over the islands .
so i want to show you one pres@@ cri@@ ption product in the clin@@ ic called the no park .
and there &apos;s this lou@@ d thum@@ ping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this , and people were sh@@ ou@@ ting in kore@@ an .
we &apos;re also working on noise can@@ cel@@ ing things like s@@ nor@@ ing , noise from autom@@ o@@ bil@@ es .
think about i@@ po@@ ds compared to ster@@ e@@ os .
but our lives will only ever always continue to be a balan@@ cing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty .
we hear a lot about the collap@@ se of co@@ d .
resear@@ ch@@ ers have found these type of an@@ om@@ ali@@ es .
like if you do an experiment on stage , and nobody can see it , they can just hear it , they would probably think you were fre@@ ak@@ y .
so , bot@@ tom@@ -up materials actually exist today .
so that &apos;s the first big problem .
&quot; yo nap@@ ot , pac@@ ak ! &quot; which , as somebody here must sur@@ ely know , means &quot; what &apos;s up , guys ? &quot; in mag@@ y@@ ar , that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar non-@@ indo-@@ european language spo@@ ken by hung@@ ari@@ ans for which , given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed as bio@@ diversity on this planet , few would have imag@@ ined much of a future even a century or two ago .
a group of us have been working on a pil@@ ot basis to address individual inst@@ an@@ ces of demand@@ s for bri@@ bes for common services or enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
we see the same lar@@ ge-@@ scale structure , but we see addi@@ tional sm@@ all-@@ scale structure .
most schools in america spend less than 7@@ ,@@ 500 dollars a year teaching a child .
i can &apos;t change the condition of the road , but i can make the cycle run faster .
and the example of p@@ is@@ a shows that data can be more powerful than administra@@ tive control of financial subsi@@ dy through which we usually run education systems .
that would not work .
m@@ j : so we &apos;ve analy@@ zed the h@@ our@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ hour power dem@@ and and supply , looking at solar , wind , using data for california .
&quot; while people are enga@@ ged in creating a totally different world , they always form vi@@ vid images of the pre@@ ce@@ ding world . &quot;
i &#91; went to &#93; university to become an economist .
you saw the woman there , the nurse .
but one of the great things about the search for massive pri@@ mes , it &apos;s not just finding the pri@@ mes .
what &apos;s the difference between a ser@@ m@@ on and our modern , se@@ cu@@ lar mo@@ de of deli@@ very , the lec@@ ture ?
and so i hope that maybe i &apos;ll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rock@@ e@@ try passion at the same time that i explore my nuclear passion .
five to seven percent only are in@@ spe@@ cted -- five to seven percent .
and so , you know , i talk to my friends and i go to plays where they &apos;re sing@@ ing russi@@ an songs .
i mean , what are the chan@@ ces that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
where &apos;s our exp@@ ort ?
so this is a time of great fl@@ ourishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physicist free@@ man dy@@ son , is not hyper@@ b@@ ole at all .
and they are inter@@ depen@@ dent over a long term .
ah ! i know where i can sho@@ ot that .
as humans , where do we find it ?
this is the room that b@@ ach wrote some of his music for . this is the organ .
and i want to talk a little bit about that , and some of the examples , so you can see what it is that we &apos;re doing .
so when i read rob@@ ert louis ste@@ ven@@ son , that wasn &apos;t fi@@ ction .
can we create the kind of patterns that we &apos;re seeing in places like iraq ?
we needed to reduce the population growth rate .
and yet , despite all of that dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an evolution and natural selec@@ tion , they &apos;ve been constra@@ ined to lie on a line .
and as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monit@@ or , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wher@@ ever they moved in the room .
i want to give what &apos;s very nearly the last word to ines .
but how efficient is , really , this multi@@ tasking ?
reti@@ ring members no@@ wa@@ days say that it &apos;s become like gang war@@ f@@ are .
and for what was then a very small organization of just a few people , trying to even begin to think how we might t@@ ack@@ le that was an enorm@@ ous challenge .
and we went into par@@ enting expe@@ cting our lives to look like this .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it when mi@@ ster pu@@ tin turns off the gas ta@@ p , because my budget goes up .
so from this experience of my re@@ covery , i want to share four particular aspe@@ cts -- i call them the four c &apos;s of consciousness -- that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day .
the story that i told myself was that ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ers looked like this .
they &apos;re not don@@ ated . they &apos;re not hea@@ vi@@ ly subsi@@ di@@ zed .
now here at ted , we &apos;re solving some of the great ri@@ dd@@ les of science and my@@ steri@@ es of the universe .
so if you don &apos;t have an end@@ game of something del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful , then you &apos;re just moving ch@@ ess pieces around , if you don &apos;t know you &apos;re taking the king .
bl@@ ess you . thank you very much .
and light and shado@@ w are a very important part of her work .
every time i look at this piece , i always wonder if my mom &apos;s whis@@ per@@ ing to my dad , &quot; he finally fol@@ ded his laun@@ dry . &quot;
you can take the very best teachers and kind of an@@ not@@ ate it , have it so everyone se@@ es who is the very best at teaching this stuff .
but with m@@ bi , we use just light , pain@@ -@@ free comp@@ res@@ sion .
not to con@@ qu@@ er the planet or space , not anymore , it has been done , but rather to improve the quality of life .
it &apos;s an old move .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
i got a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , went to university , studied international agriculture , studied anthrop@@ ology , and decided i was going to give back .
so for example , i &apos;m making images of you , but there &apos;s no physi@@ ological b@@ ond between the images i have of you as an audience and my brain .
ony@@ x ash@@ ant@@ i : this is beat@@ ja@@ z@@ z
just to show you , this really was fol@@ ded paper .
what we &apos;re here to do is to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloo@@ d@@ shed in che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
so we took all that information together .
the electr@@ on hits it suddenly .
we have some other data where they play across computers .
and i tried to build a partic@@ le acceler@@ ator .
well i don &apos;t know .
if you have this d@@ ele@@ teri@@ ous mutation in this gene , you &apos;re 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life .
then susan says &quot; lo@@ l , i know , &quot; again more gu@@ ff@@ a@@ wing than we &apos;re used to when you &apos;re talking about these in@@ conveni@@ ences .
the play@@ ers slowly explore the environment , and begin again to test things out .
the next thing is technology .
but i think we &apos;re a lot closer to err@@ ing on the side of not comprehen@@ ding the situation clearly enough , than in comprehen@@ ding it so clearly that we just can &apos;t , you know , get the ar@@ my out to kill terrori@@ sts .
and eventually you get to places where it is for@@ mi@@ d@@ able and dangerous and unfortunately sli@@ des just don &apos;t do justice .
and i think what herb@@ ie said -- please listen , listen .
i was really concerned about having to wear this g@@ ad@@ get on my face .
and one thing you need to know about drag@@ on@@ flies , one important thing , is that they la@@ y their eg@@ gs in fres@@ h water .
in a battery , i stri@@ ve to maxi@@ mi@@ ze electrical potential ; when ment@@ oring , i stri@@ ve to maxi@@ mi@@ ze human potential .
it &apos;s pretty anno@@ ying for the fis@@ her@@ men .
you &apos;d think they &apos;re coming from india . it &apos;s the clos@@ est place .
ok , you solved all the problems , you did all the stuff , you made nice , you loved your cli@@ ents , you loved the city , you &apos;re a good guy , you &apos;re a good person ...
so we concent@@ rated main@@ ly in north don@@ egal and west ker@@ ry as the two areas where i was main@@ ly active .
people bring their own coo@@ ker , he atta@@ ches a val@@ ve and a steam pi@@ pe , and now he gives you es@@ pres@@ so coffee .
and explo@@ iting that energy , human popu@@ lations multi@@ p@@ lied .
ba@@ king so@@ da and v@@ ine@@ gar .
it &apos;s not just about taking a p@@ ill , and your per@@ for@@ man@@ ce and your pain getting better .
and because of that , you start to dig around for your exter@@ nal memor@@ ies -- where did you leave them ?
but i kept telling myself fear and te@@ ars are options i did not have .
the de@@ va@@ station of those st@@ ings had taken the res@@ pir@@ atory system down so that i couldn &apos;t make the progress i wanted .
basically we have no cl@@ ue what this is .
noise becomes music .
and essentially , the story is this with right wh@@ ales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land m@@ asses moved around and oceans became is@@ ol@@ ated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct sto@@ cks .
i didn &apos;t make up pre-@@ vi@@ vor .
and we essentially pass light right through the tissue , and from understanding how much of it is trans@@ mit@@ ted , how much of it is sc@@ at@@ tered and how much of it is absor@@ bed , we can figure out and this is something which is based on a princi@@ ple called phot@@ op@@ le@@ thy@@ smo@@ graphy .
you can &apos;t look at this and say , &quot; okay now i see reality as it is . &quot;
you can see it by looking at my head .
my mother had to do a lot of expla@@ ining , telling people that her son did not com@@ mit a pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated ar@@ son .
and there &apos;s 55 trillion links between all the web pages of the world .
now , how does this work ? well , there is these smart band@@ -@@ aids or these sensors that one would put on , on a sho@@ e or on the wr@@ ist .
but we &apos;re also left with a concent@@ rated salt solution , or br@@ ine .
and the important point about this is that it &apos;s the ear@@ liest study in combin@@ at@@ or@@ ics in mathematics .
and slowly , i moved out of that mis@@ er@@ able state of mind .
it does not come for me from research .
so it was almost like coming out of the clos@@ et to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we belie@@ ved that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experi@@ enced until then .
40 billion of these things built .
and i was watching this crow@@ d of mon@@ ks and n@@ uns , many of which i had just intervie@@ wed , and heard their stories , and i wat@@ ched their faces , and they gave us a little f@@ m radio , and we could listen to the trans@@ lation of his teach@@ ings .
while living and working as a marine biolog@@ ist in mal@@ di@@ ves , charles anderson noticed sudden explosi@@ ons of drag@@ on@@ flies at certain times of year . he explains how he car@@ efully tra@@ cked the path of a pla@@ in , little drag@@ on@@ fly called the glo@@ be sk@@ immer , only to discover that it had the lon@@ gest migr@@ atory journey of any inse@@ ct in the world .

one of the sa@@ d@@ dest things about our invol@@ vement in afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our pri@@ orities out of syn@@ c .
i &apos;ve spent my life as a war@@ ri@@ or , working for women &apos;s issues , working on political campaig@@ ns , being an activ@@ ist for the environment .
now , the program says that the op@@ posi@@ te of play is not work , it &apos;s depression .
it &apos;s a great cricket cap .
i &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
so , how about the people who walk in off the street ?
it can be a bit like a bowl of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i : sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens .
asi@@ de from , you know , getting people excited and wonder@@ ing what the he@@ ck these blue dots were all over the place , it asked the school system to en@@ vision how it might become a cat@@ aly@@ st for a more connected community .
and for about five seconds , the to@@ aster to@@ ast@@ ed , but then , unfortunately , the element kind of mel@@ ted itself .
if you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 196@@ 0s , on may 25 , j@@ f@@ k said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the moon . &quot;
and he said , for the first time in his life he &apos;d thought about the ine@@ vi@@ table , and about god .
he said , &quot; na@@ if , islam and carto@@ on ?
and i &apos;m saying this as an economist who , over the past few years , has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why , but also -- and i &apos;m aware of the ir@@ ony here -- as an exper@@ t myself , as a professor , as somebody who ad@@ vis@@ es prime mini@@ sters , heads of big companies , international organizations , but an exper@@ t who belie@@ ves that the role of exper@@ ts needs to change , that we need to become more open-@@ min@@ ded , more democra@@ tic and be more open to people re@@ b@@ elling against our points of view .
it &apos;s going to be two years of studio work .
that &apos;s a dol@@ phin tail there , guys .
you know , try making some char@@ ts like this at home .
it just cele@@ br@@ ated its se@@ vent@@ h an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 5@@ 30 million dollars &apos; worth of sal@@ es to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
so if religion is not about belie@@ ving things , what is it about ?
in south africa , the edu@@ ca@@ tional system was constru@@ cted in the days of ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d for the white min@@ ority .
it &apos;s those people i &apos;d quite like to create in the world going forward .
intervie@@ wer : for a more convin@@ cing experiment , i wanted my own open@@ ing-@@ day crow@@ d , the sound check team .
even if we get everybody working on it , we &apos;ve got to be strate@@ gic .
hot@@ els and businesses can shu@@ t down un@@ used rooms from a central location , or even a cell phone .
at biom@@ i@@ mic@@ ry gu@@ il@@ d , which is my consu@@ l@@ ting company , we work with ho@@ k architects .
i was born and raised in z@@ ambi@@ a in 196@@ 9 .
today , you can buy a girl traff@@ i@@ cked for a few hundred dollars , which means she &apos;s actually more dis@@ pos@@ able .
when i told them that they weren &apos;t entirely enthusi@@ astic , but i told them , &quot; it really doesn &apos;t matter what their opinion is .
this is just a photo of one of my three-@@ dimensional paintings .
what happens when that ar@@ row goes aw@@ ry ?
we need to drive a national , if not international , fram@@ ing@@ ham@@ -@@ type heart study of independent living technologies , where we have 10,000 el@@ der@@ ly connected house@@ holds with broad@@ band , full medical charac@@ teri@@ zation , and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-@@ house@@ hold an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al studies that the universi@@ ties f@@ und , to large clin@@ ical trials that prove out the value of these technologies .
and that &apos;s the answer .
art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was lin@@ ked with two things : demo@@ li@@ tion of illegal con@@ struc@@ tions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to re@@ vi@@ ve the hope that had been lost in my city .
if you &apos;re under 50 we want you to work four more years .
i can just divide numbers , that &apos;s like at@@ om sm@@ ash@@ ing .
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 dig@@ its of this prime .
in fact , it was completely od@@ or@@ less and tast@@ eless and col@@ or@@ less , but as a po@@ is@@ on , it was the best money could buy , so women flo@@ cked to her in order to mur@@ der their hus@@ band@@ s .
and just to s@@ ample the kind of interven@@ tions that we find have an effect , when we teach people about the pleas@@ ant life , how to have more pleas@@ ure in your life , one of your assi@@ gn@@ ments is to take the min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness skills , the sa@@ vor@@ ing skills , and you &apos;re assig@@ ned to design a beautiful day .
you actually can go and read scan@@ ned books quite easily .
so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum , let &apos;s comp@@ are that with a number i &apos;ve just mentioned .
and he says , &quot; god , you really did want it . you wanted my bre@@ ad .
the rela@@ tions between the ir@@ ani@@ an and the jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive , starting in 5@@ 3@@ 9 b@@ .c. , when king cy@@ rus the great of per@@ si@@ a liber@@ ated the jewish people from their baby@@ lon@@ ian cap@@ tivity .
look for it . have you noticed it ?
and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day .
in chap@@ ter two , i photograph the des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of ar@@ th@@ ur ru@@ pp@@ in .
and also i@@ k@@ ko tan@@ aka was a very important ment@@ or in my life -- the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major i@@ con@@ s of japan , like is@@ sey mi@@ ya@@ ke &apos;s brand and also mu@@ j@@ i .
the s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter of millions in the tren@@ ches and in the death camp@@ s have caused people to ask , &quot; where is god in all this ?
d@@ s@@ r : boy , oh boy , oh boy ! and that &apos;s a straight line we got right over there . and i didn &apos;t even pro@@ mp@@ t him .
so in the world of product design , the beautiful baby &apos;s like the concept car .
the experim@@ enter would look at it , s@@ can it from top to bottom , say &quot; u@@ h huh &quot; and put it on the pi@@ le next to them .
and i am going to tell you the answer , but obviously after this short break .
for most people , if they think about hunger , they don &apos;t have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives , or their parents &apos; lives , or their grand@@ parents &apos; lives -- to remember an experience of hunger .
and just look at what happened with the tu@@ i@@ tions with the university of california and project that out for another three , four , five years -- it &apos;s un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each con@@ ta@@ ining row upon row of c@@ ots , in each of which la@@ y a child star@@ ing into space .
thank you .
she does this with car@@ d@@ board , but since i have an expensive computer here i &apos;ll just ro@@ tate this little guy around and ...
we don &apos;t have that . so that &apos;s one problem .
and i thought , well , hen@@ ry vi@@ ii , okay .
because it is a bit of a ni@@ che market , and there &apos;s not much work going on , especially where i &apos;m from .
so , you know , for years i would go to bars and , sort of , anyone i met whose name was eric i was hum@@ ping immediately , or something .
or terror , as the case may be ? right ?
so , i thought , could we have dar@@ i@@ us serve as our baby@@ c@@ am car@@ rier , and that way get the in@@ puts that we feed into dy@@ l@@ an ?
finally , at the end of use , we could bio@@ de@@ grade it naturally along with your vege@@ table pe@@ el@@ ings .
whenever we tried to h@@ unt , we were called po@@ ach@@ ers .
and all-@@ powerful folks don &apos;t need check@@ li@@ sts .
and z@@ ish@@ an takes it ! india wins !
well , you &apos;d die if you did that .
that &apos;s great ! i love red wine !
her@@ i@@ bert wat@@ z@@ ke : the brain in your gut
so the water is chur@@ ned through this ra@@ ft .
see , i grew up in be@@ th@@ le@@ hem , pen@@ n@@ sylvania , the home of be@@ th@@ le@@ hem steel .
so what &apos;s the connection ?
if you allow google to , it will tell you your search history .
they talk about these kinds of experiences .
this is a gent@@ o@@ o pengu@@ in . and she was still skep@@ tical .
and they came down on the side of open publi@@ cation , which is the right approach -- we &apos;ve brie@@ fed the white house , we &apos;ve brie@@ fed members of con@@ gress , we &apos;ve tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advan@@ ces .
i remember when i was 19 , i did , i wanted to do my first art ex@@ hibi@@ tion , and i wanted the whole world to know about it .
so chris could be out here inter@@ ac@@ ting with another part of la@@ va , while i kind of play around with it here . you can imagine a new kind of sculp@@ ting tool , where i &apos;m kind of warming something up , making it mal@@ le@@ able , and then le@@ tting it cool down and soli@@ di@@ fying in a certain state .
we &apos;re so good at over@@ coming our biological limit@@ ations -- you know , i fle@@ w over here in an air@@ plane .
the tit@@ ani@@ um &apos;s several thousand dollars , but the forms are very cheap .
they said , &quot; we have a product that p@@ aus@@ es live tv , sk@@ i@@ ps commer@@ ci@@ als , re@@ win@@ ds live tv and memor@@ i@@ zes your vie@@ wing hab@@ its without you even asking . &quot;
and now 4,000 chur@@ ches have joined the environmental movement .
in this proto@@ cell model , it &apos;s just an oil drop@@ let , but a chemical metaboli@@ sm inside that allows this proto@@ cell to use energy to do something , to actually become dynamic , as we &apos;ll see here .
r@@ s : that &apos;s exactly right .
another thing all these molecules are telling us that , appar@@ ently , bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolu@@ tionary history , which is a clear indi@@ cation of how spec@@ tac@@ ularly important this tra@@ it is for survival .
which is right ?
this is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is afri@@ g@@ ad@@ get .
fif@@ ty years ago , such an@@ om@@ ali@@ es covered only two@@ - to three-@@ ten@@ ths of one percent of the land area .
i get a breath of te@@ ar gas and i can &apos;t breathe .
and man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p are offi@@ cially the fa@@ st@@ est measu@@ red fee@@ ding stri@@ ke of any animal system . so our first surprise .
why are you po@@ sting these photos ? &quot;
and for the first time , we &apos;re able to watch the journey of a tun@@ a ben@@ e@@ ath the ocean using light and phot@@ ons to measure sun@@ rise and sun@@ set .
bf : yeah . and so we &apos;ve actually found a way to in@@ corporate richard in this .
i recor@@ ded an awesome sing@@ er , and i took the sound of his voice in my computer , and i war@@ ped it in coun@@ tless ways to come up with the so@@ und@@ track that you &apos;re about to hear .
i looked out the windows and i saw a full hal@@ f-@@ circle of explosion .
now , econom@@ i@@ sts tend to -- -- econom@@ i@@ sts tend to view the world through their own len@@ ses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
about 20 percent of all the nation &apos;s program@@ mers were wr@@ apped up in this thing , and it led to an aw@@ ful lot of what we have today . it also used v@@ acu@@ um tu@@ bes .
one pack@@ age , 17 cents a day -- their mal@@ nutri@@ tion is over@@ come .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , ga@@ ther around .
i use information , education .
so here &apos;s the i@@ pad .
but i &apos;d like to go back to br@@ un@@ el here , and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now , and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool .
so you see the style is different .
so , my job in convin@@ cing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ed to within its schwarz@@ schild radius .
but they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ gel@@ y created , and i can agree on that .
i was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so i decided to hi@@ de it from my parents .
it &apos;s a funny thing because the rest of us occu@@ p@@ y it quite frequ@@ ently and quite well .
the good people in scot@@ land are still impro@@ ving my voice , and i &apos;m optimi@@ stic about it .
crow@@ ds are gather@@ ed in tahri@@ r square .
now what steven was saying was , &quot; look , adam , you are at a critical jun@@ c@@ ture in your life here , my friend .
but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
those of you from northern india will be familiar with this .
i am of course quot@@ ing from a famous es@@ say by leon@@ ard read , the economist in the 195@@ 0s , called &quot; i , pen@@ cil &quot; in which he wrote about how a pen@@ cil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pen@@ cil , because the people who assem@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphi@@ te , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
they only take six weeks . instead of 11 months , they &apos;re six weeks .
it can change your work@@ flow -- actually , it can change everything in your company ; it can turn your company up@@ side down .
we have created such a situation , arti@@ fi@@ cially , by turning on the cri@@ tic with a fl@@ ash of light .
and everyone agre@@ es that trees are beautiful , and i &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; i don &apos;t like trees . &quot;
of that stuff , what do you carry ?
and the answer is : all of them .
and he has a s@@ wee@@ the@@ art , but she is american woman , not chinese .
now if these ine@@ qualities , climate and war can be avo@@ i@@ ded , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening .
having done a lot of maga@@ zin@@ es , i &apos;m very curious how big maga@@ zin@@ es handle big stories , and i was very curious to see how time and new@@ s@@ week would handle 9 / 11 .
and we found that everything is normal .
by 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s estim@@ ated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities .
she &apos;s very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone -- so happy that she even voted for her .
i still paint . i love art .
but rob van lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h and all that stuff .
they aggre@@ gate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interest@@ s and values are a far more powerful aggre@@ g@@ ator of human beings than demographic categories .
you can see me , i have the same ha@@ ir@@ cut , in the upper right corner .
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toile@@ ts to cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p .
now — — ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , be prepar@@ ed .
so , all the wat@@ ers of the world are ser@@ ved there , so we thought that , you know , after being at the water and moving through the water and brea@@ thing the water , you could also drin@@ k this building .
and there you can see that wo@@ od@@ cut is basically what i ended up doing .
in the rest of my talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about how i learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the indu@@ s scri@@ pt .
so we do everything that lea@@ ds up to success , but then we get there . we figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our com@@ fort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot@@ line .
again , trans@@ formed in stage 10 in the o@@ ven because what went into the o@@ ven as d@@ ough comes out in stage 11 as bre@@ ad .
there &apos;s nothing left -- just a bit of gr@@ ass there .
and that &apos;s a problem .
it &apos;s a mar@@ ker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
many people suspe@@ ct that just as we &apos;ve gone from belie@@ ving in one solar system to z@@ il@@ li@@ ons of solar systems , one galaxy to many galaxies , we have to go to many big ban@@ gs from one big bang , perhaps these many big ban@@ gs dis@@ playing an im@@ men@@ se variety of proper@@ ties .
that &apos;s much more important than running anti-@@ vir@@ uses or running fire@@ walls .
so we met dan about three years ago , three and a half years ago , when we started working at te@@ w@@ ks@@ b@@ ury . everybody we met there was fantastic , did fantastic music . dan had never made music before , and it turned out he was really fantastic at it . he &apos;s a born comp@@ os@@ er .
my family ate one me@@ al per day , at night .
that was an incredible talk .
and since i started talking about this subject and resear@@ ching this subject , i &apos;ve been really ha@@ un@@ ted by something a japanese mathemati@@ cian said on the subject .
so this red stri@@ p signifi@@ es the color of the w@@ all@@ paper in the bas@@ ement apart@@ ment where i was staying .
no bill ever dis@@ appeared .
a questi@@ on@@ na@@ ire .
it &apos;s mass individu@@ al@@ ism from a single product . it f@@ its the hand .
and a co@@ ordin@@ ation cost is essentially all of the financial or institu@@ tional difficul@@ ties in ar@@ ran@@ ging group out@@ put .
imagine if a team of physi@@ ci@@ sts could stand inside of an at@@ om and watch and hear electr@@ ons spin .
as that data mat@@ ures , they &apos;ll send it to george church , who will work his magic , get passen@@ ger pi@@ geon dna out of that .
boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school .
it &apos;s the only place you ever go for a walk in the wo@@ ods and all the trees are lin@@ ed up in ro@@ ws .
and hundreds of thousands of children , inci@@ dent@@ ally , are subje@@ cted to this every year .
now in the last 50 years , we americ@@ ans have gotten a lot of the things that we want . we &apos;re richer .
because if i can get that right , i can make them wonderful , and i can make them repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly wonderful .
well , the fore@@ man could see he was in over his head , i guess .
then it goes to a diagno@@ stic center , and within one minute of your heart attack , your signal appe@@ ars on the screen of a computer and the computer analy@@ zes what your problem is .
they could point at the visual object , or they could mi@@ mic the whist@@ le .
it was before the avi@@ an flu had re@@ ach@@ ed europe .
and it worked , or so i belie@@ ved .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
people never want to say , i really don &apos;t understand .
we can &apos;t be killing anybody or hur@@ ting anybody on set , or any pass@@ er@@ by . so , safety is everything .
the victi@@ m &apos;s brain rel@@ eas@@ es oxytocin , and you &apos;re opening up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money .
and pretty soon , they began shi@@ pping that coal , ton by ton , ra@@ il car by ra@@ il car , bo@@ at@@ load by bo@@ at@@ load , back to china and elsewhere around the world .
i justi@@ fied it , and i said , &quot; this is the cost of revolution .
we got@@ ta fix that . we got@@ ta out@@ law that right away .
jar@@ g@@ on is a big one .
after they wat@@ ched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
and on the photograph , he wrote with a fl@@ our@@ ish , &quot; to horse face , with love from ge@@ off@@ re@@ y di@@ ck@@ ens , m@@ .@@ p@@ . &quot;
so , it &apos;s been an honor . thank you mur@@ ray g@@ ell@@ -@@ mann .
the lou@@ dest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that .
would they ye@@ ar@@ n for my appro@@ val , my love , my voice ?
and to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affec@@ ts us and how it affec@@ ts the way we &apos;re par@@ enting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
and a huge er@@ up@@ tion of discussion around accessi@@ bility came , and we &apos;re really excited about that .
we &apos;ve deter@@ min@@ ed from the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke activity that you &apos;re seeing here that the top of that vol@@ can@@ o is er@@ up@@ ting , so we dep@@ lo@@ y the tro@@ ops .
he came to talk to her and said , &quot; what is this about ? &quot;
just to give an idea , the world has to stabili@@ ze at something like 20 gi@@ gat@@ ons per year .
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
you know , i think people go into a restaurant , and somebody orders a ste@@ ak , and we all know where ste@@ ak comes from , and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is , but when they &apos;re eating blu@@ ef@@ in sus@@ hi , do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they &apos;re consum@@ ing ?
because america is an incredibly rich country .
that &apos;s what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
and when you can do stuff like this -- these are my kids putting in this technology , and when you can build a ro@@ of that looks like that on a house that looks like that with se@@ d@@ um that looks like this , this is the new green gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i .
so that &apos;s the bottom line .
it took 10 years , and then within a couple of months , it was such a hit they just introduced it and roll@@ ed it across the entire system of mcdonald &apos;s in the country .
i &apos;ve tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but i &apos;ve been studying nature recently .
and we actually had to inst@@ all white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t bel@@ ong together .
i &apos;m itali@@ an . in ital@@ y , design is normal .
and incredible car .
and i said , &quot; yes , like the human@@ e society .
there are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework .
derek para@@ vi@@ cin@@ i and adam o@@ ck@@ el@@ ford : in the key of genius
and ama@@ zingly , that evolution susta@@ ins the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory that biological evolution had establi@@ shed toward greater complexity .
that &apos;s almost twice the country &apos;s an@@ nu@@ al health and education budget combined .
that &apos;s really my thinking .
wh@@ o@@ o@@ o !
though when the dod@@ gers ab@@ and@@ oned us to come to l@@ .@@ a. , i lost faith in bas@@ e@@ ball until i moved to boston and became an ir@@ rational red so@@ cks fan .
the water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way up@@ stre@@ am .
how many children will you get ?
i consider myself a very spiritu@@ al person , and without , you know , the organized religion part , and i will tell you : i don &apos;t believe there &apos;s anything un@@ natural .
the first , if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do , is the du@@ ty of vision .
the fact that it happens in &quot; another country &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
but one of my students , a fres@@ h@@ man named char@@ lot@@ te , was not convinced .
and i don &apos;t have to do anything .
there &apos;s something else about them that you see -- they don &apos;t see themselves .
i got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
but , like sar@@ din@@ ia , o@@ kin@@ a@@ wa has a few social constru@@ cts that we can associ@@ ate with lon@@ ge@@ vity .
now , the other two sides of the co@@ in are : being a real fa@@ ke -- is what it says it is , but is not true to itself , or being a fa@@ ke real : is true to itself , but not what it says it is .
can@@ ari@@ es used to be used as kind of bios@@ en@@ sor@@ s in min@@ es .
and she &apos;ll come to en@@ car@@ ta , one of the main online en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ as .
i had built a person@@ a all around what i could and couldn &apos;t do .
interestingly , it &apos;s happened almost entirely without media cover@@ age .
it &apos;s fascinating , because all tri@@ be leaders have char@@ is@@ ma , but you don &apos;t need char@@ is@@ ma to become a leader .
and these ages of man are still at work today .
three hours of bottom time , average distance travel@@ ed -- one mile .
it &apos;s hard work every single day .
you &apos;re actually a little bit un@@ usual . every time we demon@@ strate this , it &apos;s usually about a 50-@@ 50 spli@@ t , which f@@ its with the research , 5@@ 4 percent . maybe people here in win@@ ni@@ pe@@ g are more sus@@ pi@@ cious and better at fig@@ uring it out .
the little hole in the middle , we &apos;ll come to a bit later , but that &apos;s for the pollen tube to come out later on . a very tiny tube .
teenagers do not wear wri@@ st@@ wat@@ ches .
now just like the physical m@@ aps of our world that have been highly influ@@ enced by technology -- think google m@@ aps , think gps -- the same thing is happening for brain m@@ apping through transformation .
and it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reli@@ able machine that we &apos;ve ever made .
so , what i &apos;m going to do is just give you the lat@@ est ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of india &apos;s -- maybe the world &apos;s -- lon@@ gest running so@@ ap oper@@ a , which is cricket .
so top six regre@@ ts -- the things we regre@@ t most in life : number one by far , education .
you see a hand coun@@ ting money just in front of me .
when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , i met the com@@ man@@ der of is@@ af , the international tro@@ ops .
it also happens in , for example , cancer research .
it &apos;s almost like this thing here , which you can &apos;t even see . &quot;
zz@@ zz@@ z@@ zi@@ p for safety .
i mean , do you worry about the p@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box issue here ?
that guy is rock@@ in &apos; .
because i think it &apos;s an ur@@ gent question .
it ru@@ ined my life -- &quot; the in@@ convenient truth &quot; and mr. gore .
and emplo@@ yers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren &apos;t actually ready for real work , didn &apos;t have the right at@@ titu@@ des and experience .
and then , new change , we had hair band@@ s , clo@@ thing and the con@@ dom for your mobile phone during the rain@@ y seas@@ on .
it seems a little out of place in a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge environment like this one .
so he never tru@@ sted me , but i didn &apos;t give up .
and so doctors and nur@@ ses who need to try to change people &apos;s behaviors don &apos;t have the skills , don &apos;t have the time -- our ment@@ or mothers do .
so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years , we &apos;ll be able to look at a million star systems , a million star systems , looking for signals that would prove somebody &apos;s out there .
i had to remain perfectly still and just rela@@ x and think that i wasn &apos;t in my body , and just control that .
the lives of the el@@ der@@ ly are wid@@ ely recogni@@ zed as con@@ stit@@ u@@ ting a disaster area of modern american society .
all right , i &apos;ve got a minute . so , the ted wish : i wish that you -- you person@@ ally and every creative individual and organization you know -- will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples -- a thousand ! -- of trans@@ forma@@ tive part@@ ner@@ ships .
i love things that are alive .
in mala@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pay school fe@@ es .
el@@ iz@@ ab@@ eth : this is no time for mer@@ cy , wal@@ sing@@ ham .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monit@@ ored by the culture .
photo@@ graphy car@@ ri@@ es a power that holds up under the rel@@ ent@@ less s@@ wir@@ l of today &apos;s satur@@ ated , media world , because photograph@@ s e@@ mu@@ late the way that our mind free@@ zes a significant moment .
when he goes to work , he doesn &apos;t stop by to talk to anybody , he doesn &apos;t call .
i call it &quot; s@@ n@@ ack time . &quot;
because there &apos;s a fundamental dis@@ connect , as i said , that actually , the people with the power want to do big expensive things .
if you imit@@ ate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
this ship s@@ ank 1,@@ 500 years ago .
let me tell you , sur@@ ge@@ ons are not born .
in 196@@ 2 , charles van d@@ oren , who was later a sen@@ ior edi@@ tor of britanni@@ ca , said the ide@@ al en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia should be radi@@ cal -- it should stop being safe .
but anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the technolog@@ y-@@ creating species to bring on the next stage , which were the first ste@@ ps in technological evolution .
we want to clear away the tox@@ ic soil from this area and have an organic gar@@ den .
the ac@@ id rain was falling on the forests .
we have much clever@@ er irri@@ gation .
it &apos;s what the den@@ ti@@ st cle@@ ans off your te@@ eth every time that you go in for a visit .
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this an@@ gel in the world -- not only in our country , venezuela , but in our world .
a few years ago i rein@@ v@@ ented my process to keep up with people like gre@@ g ly@@ n@@ n , tom main , za@@ ha ha@@ did , rem ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as -- all these people that i think are per@@ sever@@ ing and pion@@ e@@ ering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form .
this tun@@ a symboli@@ zes what &apos;s the problem for all of us in the room .
and indeed , most people associ@@ ate space with silence .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
so here you can see behind this list .
we associ@@ ate repe@@ ti@@ tion with bor@@ e@@ dom .
an n@@ y@@ u resear@@ cher here took little car@@ d@@ board robots with s@@ mi@@ ley faces on them , and a motor that just dro@@ ve them forward and a fla@@ g sti@@ cking out the back with a des@@ i@@ red dest@@ ination .
so how do we expect -- does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they &apos;re inter@@ rup@@ ted all night ?
it &apos;s not like you just look over there and say , what am i seeing now ?
it &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle .
let me show you what you could do right now .
dna analysis , one of the hall@@ mar@@ ks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of bones actually bel@@ on@@ ged to the person who read all those a@@ stronom@@ ical books which were filled with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver hair that was c@@ oper@@ nic@@ us &apos; hair -- obviously not many other people bo@@ ther@@ ed to read these books later on .
you put the stick in the po@@ w@@ der to take the s@@ ac@@ red ash@@ es -- well , they &apos;re not ash@@ es , they &apos;re bur@@ nt li@@ me@@ stone -- to em@@ power the co@@ ca lea@@ f , to change the p@@ h of the mouth to fac@@ ili@@ tate the absor@@ ption of co@@ ca@@ ine hydro@@ ch@@ l@@ ori@@ de .
or any of the other fun@@ n@@ y-@@ looking little dogs .
i want to look at the heart .
but i do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transpar@@ ency at the center of poli@@ tics where the message is , &quot; it &apos;s transpar@@ ency , stupid . &quot;
now why would they return to such de@@ adly soil ?
but more than that , your brain gets meas@@ ur@@ ably bigger .
and for a swi@@ m@@ mer , you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to gra@@ b the water and pull it through with you .
you can go to or@@ cat@@ ech@@ .@@ or@@ g -- it has nothing to do with wh@@ ales , it &apos;s the or@@ eg@@ on center for aging and technology -- to see more about that .
now , mr. alli@@ g@@ ator never did come , but the idea of mr. alli@@ g@@ ator coming actually sa@@ ved my san@@ ity and made it ok for me to keep going because i belie@@ ved , in the distance , there would be someone coming to res@@ cue me .
they call it the o@@ val office .
and in 3@@ 3@@ 8 b@@ .c. he and de@@ mos@@ th@@ en@@ es together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of phili@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don .
so they &apos;re all using this molecule for inter@@ species communication .
now even that &apos;s more complicated than you think .
so if i &apos;m successful , then you &apos;ll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that &apos;s ever wanted to have access to it .
he was telling me , &quot; patients are coming . &quot;
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
so we look at a process of group dynam@@ ics : co@@ al@@ escence and fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
it &apos;s about making the world a better place . &quot;
bring infrastructure to the fa@@ velas , to the slums , wher@@ ever you are .
we have to do re@@ al-@@ time competi@@ tion . &quot;
and so i fle@@ w to st. louis and met ray , and he &apos;s a pre@@ a@@ cher -- among other things .
high-@@ per@@ forming systems are very care@@ ful in how they rec@@ ru@@ it and sel@@ ect their teachers and how they train them .
we &apos;ve already seen examples of this working well .
i too was fascinated by this new and dis@@ rup@@ tive cell technology , and this inspired a shi@@ ft in my min@@ d@@ set , from transplan@@ ting whole organ@@ s to transplan@@ ting cells .
it was the first dna p@@ ha@@ ge , dna virus , dna genome that was actually sequ@@ enced .
and i was thinking of the hypo@@ ther@@ mia and maybe some sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der pain and all the other things -- the v@@ om@@ iting that comes from being in the sal@@ t@@ water .
we were trying to sk@@ i from this group of islands up here , sever@@ na@@ ya z@@ em@@ l@@ ya , to the north pole .
de@@ bor@@ ah gor@@ don : the emer@@ gent genius of ant col@@ on@@ ies
so those are the three a &apos;s .
that &apos;s the first day at the hole in the wall .
and we are now in the process of rais@@ ing the full en@@ dow@@ ment .
now , that kid was wrong by four orders of magni@@ tu@@ de , but there was no doubt about it , these kids were smart .
i &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adap@@ t to whatever environment they &apos;re growing in .
it just so happened that the civil rights movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life .
they just can &apos;t afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons .
and you need it in a different position when you &apos;re up@@ right , then when you &apos;re re@@ cl@@ ined .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
so , the bottom line is that almost all research using sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles has taken place well below 500 feet .
that means mil@@ o &apos;s mind , as millions of people use it , will get smar@@ ter and clever@@ er .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
today , 16 african countries and growing have so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n country rat@@ ings . what does this mean ?
our at@@ titu@@ de is , &quot; well , look , if you can get the ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing don@@ ated , you know , at four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , i &apos;m okay with that .
and several things are important .
and then , not only will god s@@ mile and the e@@ ter@@ nal ma@@ ma will s@@ mile , but kar@@ en arm@@ strong will s@@ mile .
and earlier this year , he got a request from the green par@@ ty in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resul@@ ted in the austr@@ ali@@ an par@@ li@@ am@@ ent adop@@ ting the most ri@@ gor@@ ous carbon ta@@ x regi@@ me of any country in the world .
well , many of you have the image , don &apos;t you , of the sp@@ ot@@ ty teenager sitting in a bas@@ ement , hac@@ king away for not@@ or@@ iety .
visual integration has been associ@@ ated with autis@@ m by several resear@@ ch@@ ers .
so we &apos;ve all heard of mr@@ is . mr@@ is use magne@@ tic fields and radio waves and they take s@@ nap@@ sh@@ ots of your brain or your kne@@ e or your stom@@ ach , gra@@ y@@ scale images that are fro@@ zen in time .
what other evidence is there that the scri@@ pt could actually en@@ code language ?
and ter@@ ence died six days later .
i love that .
and i &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
so , i think all people , we need that , but especially , i look at people like me , you know like , i mean , lat@@ in@@ os -- we &apos;re about to be the majority , in like two weeks .
but when the fish came back and began predat@@ ing and controll@@ ing the ur@@ ch@@ in population , low and be@@ hold , kel@@ p forests emer@@ ged in s@@ hal@@ low water .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x , which is a bird , a primi@@ tive bird , still has that very primi@@ tive hand .
and so she kept those things in her des@@ k , and years later , after she reti@@ red , i wat@@ ched some of those same kids come through and say to her , &quot; you know , m@@ s. wal@@ ker , you made a difference in my life .
and that is the freedom of mo@@ bility that my great grand@@ father brought to people is now being thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , just as the environment is .
i thought , &quot; god , here we go . we &apos;re , we &apos;re -- this is all or nothing . &quot;
yeah , i mean , just to point out here , you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube .
these cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are a major con@@ stit@@ u@@ ent of the oceans , and they are a major part of the di@@ et of gra@@ zing bal@@ e@@ en wh@@ ales .
and then he said to me , &quot; what did you want to be when you were little ? &quot;
she &apos;s ob@@ ese before she even gets to primary school .
in some in@@ cho@@ ate , in@@ artic@@ u@@ late way i realized that there was something wrong with my work , with me .
i had a bit of an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any being lost in pen@@ n@@ sylvania , and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
you believe a pro@@ position , p , and i don &apos;t .
they turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of re@@ boot@@ ed the 21@@ st century .
i ha@@ sten to add that it &apos;s my experience , because everyone becomes psycho@@ tic in his or her own way .
in con@@ jun@@ ction with our can@@ adi@@ an colleagues , we &apos;ve set this up .
and to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
with my own healthcare problems , i &apos;ve taken drug therap@@ ies , i &apos;ve travel@@ ed to this hospital and others , many , many times .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expec@@ tancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
but i want you to for@@ give me when i use these examples because i &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about sli@@ me , and color changes . check this out .
and they did not turn out to be the islam@@ ist boo@@ gy@@ man that the dic@@ tat@@ ors were always using to justi@@ fy their regi@@ me .
for example , vol@@ a@@ tile organic com@@ pounds are chemical poll@@ ut@@ ants that are found in our schools , homes and work@@ places .
we &apos;re not asking meaningful me@@ tri@@ cs .
and i think that institutions should stand up and rel@@ ease all their data under un@@ re@@ stri@@ cted lic@@ en@@ ses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
the fla@@ g had to be made out of little str@@ ands of gold .
i &apos;m telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demon@@ strate where that food ends up .
you &apos;re going to have to fu@@ ck up really b@@ adly to make it bad . &quot;
so the core of this reactor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical re@@ activity , means that there &apos;s no in@@ cl@@ ination for the fission products to leave this reactor .
that &apos;s to prevent pir@@ ates from attac@@ king it .
these things are continu@@ ing to happen .
so what i have here is a wireless rou@@ ter .
and@@ re@@ w tea@@ ches one of the bigger stanford class@@ es .
so basically , we &apos;ve used those two factors .
because to imit@@ ate a complex act requ@@ ires my brain to adop@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
hat@@ ed the job .
a lot of people say , &quot; i &apos;m living . &quot; no , you &apos;re not living -- that &apos;s just exi@@ sting .
and again , it forms the same straight line . you have a little bit of thi@@ ck@@ ening in the line because people do have dis@@ agre@@ ements , what the key points are , there &apos;s differences of opinion when agriculture started , or how long the cam@@ brian explosion took .
now go@@ ering was , by all accoun@@ ts , a terrible man .
this is a still from a film i worked on recently , called &quot; blind door . &quot;
i can t@@ oss these things around . they &apos;re so much more tangi@@ ble and tou@@ ch@@ able -- and you know i can dou@@ b@@ le-@@ click on something to take a look at it .
10 years ago , dr. pal@@ ti fo@@ unded a company called no@@ vo@@ cure to develop his discovery into a practical therap@@ y for patients .
the rule is : nobody cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zes anybody &apos;s ideas .
when he realized his wife had to choose between bu@@ ying family me@@ als and bu@@ ying her mon@@ th@@ ly &quot; supp@@ lies , &quot; ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mur@@ u@@ gan@@ anth@@ am vo@@ wed to help her solve the problem of the san@@ it@@ ary pad . his research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model .
each of these univer@@ ses has extra dimensions .
they dres@@ sed differently ; they were different people .
i guess that &apos;s better living through bu@@ gs .
it &apos;s still d@@ ough . nobody e@@ ats bre@@ ad d@@ ough -- a few people do , i think , but not too many .
pol@@ ari@@ zation ris@@ es .
how can you be one without the other ?
these v@@ ec@@ tors and ar@@ ro@@ ws represent ever stron@@ ger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region .
it looks more global . if you take this whole thing , it is a very big machine , very reli@@ able machine , more reli@@ able than its parts .
and what van@@ ne@@ v@@ ar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
i know a thing or two about hos@@ pit@@ als .
you still are on a piece of ice , you can still have sun@@ light and you can still survive while you &apos;re traveling from one place to another .
this picture of se@@ ymour -- 25 years ago . se@@ ymour made a very simple obser@@ vation in 196@@ 8 , and then basically pres@@ ented it in 19@@ 70 -- ap@@ ri@@ l 11 to be precise -- called &quot; teaching children thinking . &quot;
he &apos;s got no arms .
it &apos;s just what i &apos;ve always wanted .
: &quot; hell@@ o , can i tell you what happened in the wo@@ ods back there ?
so we are back to the age of coloni@@ zation , and we , the foreign users of the internet , we should think about americ@@ ans as our ma@@ sters .
because the clo@@ ck is ti@@ cking for all of us .
and we are flying it , or trying to .
something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue , so that you can make a we@@ dding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally .
we have not had an idea .
but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together .
suddenly and for the very first time , colle@@ ctive de@@ fen@@ se , the thing that has domin@@ ated us as the concept of se@@ cur@@ ing our nations , is no longer enough .
pri@@ or to world war ii , they were making 1000 plan@@ es a year .
and those are the ones that change the world .
there are two ways : on the left is what we call the ly@@ tic way , where the vir@@ uses go right in and take over the cells .
and this noise is like a &quot; sh@@ hhhh@@ hhhh@@ hh@@ h@@ h , &quot; like that .
and then i thought , what if i added this feature , where i can say , this point , you can fly like a bird . you &apos;re free , kind of thing .
when i came home to g@@ and@@ o to bring the good news , my people were over the moon , but when they realized that i was planning to use clay , they were shocked .
i &apos;ve been a huge fan of enter@@ prise and entrepreneur@@ ship since 199@@ 3 .
now , today , less than one-@@ tent@@ h of one percent of the world &apos;s population are scientists and engineers .
the study showed that food companies ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated typ@@ ically seven times more than an independent study .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relev@@ ance to humans that we really need to , even from a sel@@ fish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
and we don &apos;t have to go over@@ seas to find people willing to do har@@ m , for whatever their reasons .
first is : where do we get inspiration ?
and that &apos;s all well and good .
she went up to the fore@@ man ; she said , &quot; i &apos;ve got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . &quot;
and at the same time , it re@@ moves us from the real subject matter , and this acts as a sort of ti@@ ti@@ ll@@ ating thing .
and then they &apos;re up again at eight in the morning .
that &apos;s what en@@ zy@@ mes are doing .
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
the problem was that an influ@@ ential group at oxford began argu@@ ing that because it worked so well in economics , this de@@ du@@ ctive me@@ thod ought to be applied to the natural sci@@ ences too .
and i want to ask the question -- and we &apos;ll give them that two percent hi@@ ke in income , in sal@@ ary each year as well , because we believe in growth .
and this is happening more and more .
well , good morning .
the my@@ ri@@ ad voices of humanity are not failed attemp@@ ts at being us .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for gra@@ ding at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
quite a difficult brief , make a pa@@ ir of men &apos;s pan@@ ts look beautiful .
3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 9@@ 3@@ 1 ; double that to get 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2 .
if you think that , pla@@ to &apos;s not your guy .
to put these numbers in perspective , this is eight times larger than the number of cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties in the iraq and afghanistan wars combined .
it is , i agree , a nice thing to do .
it &apos;s a coloni@@ al animal .
this is the large hadron collider .
the effect of this , of course , is it &apos;s not just am@@ ber waves of gra@@ in , it is mountains of stuff .
and the local se@@ ab@@ ir@@ d res@@ cue center , named san@@ c@@ co@@ b , immediately launched a massive res@@ cue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal res@@ cue ever under@@ taken .
aids had become a chron@@ ic disease .
&quot; ga@@ zelle , i killed you for your skin &apos;s ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te touch , for how easy it is to be na@@ iled to a board wea@@ ther@@ ed ra@@ w as white bu@@ t@@ cher paper .
of course , i understood that what made him stand t@@ all -- yeah they were the legs , thank you very much -- but as a first step , it was the dignity .
it is a mobile ph@@ one-@@ shaped box that has an ir@@ on weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
ro@@ ad@@ kill pi@@ ck@@ er-@@ up@@ pers whist@@ le while they work . i swe@@ ar to god -- i did it with them .
i feel a little uncomfortable .
no tar sand@@ s mine has actually ever been den@@ i@@ ed appro@@ val , so it is essentially a ru@@ b@@ ber stam@@ p .
i &apos;m an artist , so i &apos;d like to offer a mo@@ dest pro@@ pos@@ al at the inter@@ section of art , science and culture .
they were actually mod@@ eled on hot@@ ro@@ d motor@@ cy@@ cles of the 196@@ 0s , which i &apos;m sure my mom didn &apos;t know .
be a green consumer . you have cho@@ ices with everything you buy , between things that have a har@@ sh effect or a much less har@@ sh effect on the global climate crisis .
and so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars speci@@ fically on ba@@ it sta@@ tions to prevent ter@@ mit@@ es from eating your house .
this is a bul@@ let coming from a very large am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion company in the united states .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they &apos;re digiti@@ zed , but we didn &apos;t know how to quite get them digiti@@ zed .
thank you .
well today , i &apos;m very pleas@@ ed to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shif@@ ting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you the fin@@ dings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental ill@@ n@@ esses .
bring it back up .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
i haven &apos;t given a talk in nearly four months .
and i had a special instal@@ lation in tribu@@ te to my in-@@ laws .
dp : &quot; tiger ra@@ g . &quot;
one example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pages of inter@@ po@@ l and search for wanted person@@ s .
and i know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those air@@ bag@@ s .
second of all , we should really stri@@ ve to use far less energy in creating these materials .
there is port@@ able ones . there is large display ones .
people get mad at the ma@@ yo@@ r . so how &apos;s the traffic tonight ?
so i thought , okay , i have to have some cri@@ ter@@ ia of how to choose work .
l-@@ dop@@ a increas@@ es dop@@ am@@ ine .
now , the question is , where &apos;s the sound made ?
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
mo@@ ham@@ ed nan@@ ab@@ ha@@ y who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of al@@ ja@@ ze@@ er@@ a.@@ net , he told me that a 2,@@ 500 percent increase of ac@@ cess@@ ing our website from various parts of the world .
and i took the group and got people to focus on : if you didn &apos;t lose somebody today , your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else . there are people -- then one woman got up and she was so angry and scre@@ aming and y@@ elling .
these are some pieces of things i used in my sputnik feature film , which op@@ ens in new york in two weeks down@@ town .
in 196@@ 2 the uns@@ old stock was pur@@ chas@@ ed by mau@@ rice ha@@ ver@@ piece , a weal@@ thy pr@@ une ju@@ ice bott@@ ler , and con@@ soli@@ dated to form the core collection .
you know , let &apos;s just make an edu@@ cated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle .
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
one of the things that i wanted to sum@@ mari@@ ze for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
and that &apos;s really clear now .
essentially , it does it by provi@@ ding a smo@@ oth r@@ amp of gradu@@ al step@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step incre@@ ment .
they &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mor@@ es .
so , those are the two cli@@ ps i &apos;m going to show .
and so she wrote her first po@@ em , a love po@@ em unlike any i had ever heard before .
every time we lead one of these eff@@ or@@ ts we have to whi@@ p ourselves into this imm@@ in@@ ent threat thing .
the guy went up and started di@@ ck@@ ering , and 10 dollars later , we had four cam@@ els .
let &apos;s see . we stopped the world then . this is all u.n. statistics that have been available . here we go . can you see there ?
and i say , &quot; yes , they &apos;re all for you . &quot;
and so — i gave a qui@@ z , 20 questions .
and , sure enough , with all the other pres@@ sur@@ es on the river , like sand mining , for example , very , very heavy cul@@ tivation all the way down to the river &apos;s edge , not allo@@ wing the animals to bre@@ ed anymore , we &apos;re looking at even more problems building up for the gh@@ ari@@ al , despite the early good inten@@ tions .
it &apos;s nation@@ -@@ based , while the threat is international .
s@@ j : it &apos;s cold .
but the problem isn &apos;t pri@@ mar@@ ily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to con@@ gress .
and why was the ant doing it ?
this a google g@@ 1 .
so what you &apos;re now going to see is how we actually did it .
and i &apos;ve developed a very wonderful relationship with this cre@@ ature by this point , and i &apos;ve realized that this is a mean son of a bit@@ ch .
because you shouldn &apos;t defin@@ e people by their ma@@ d@@ dest ed@@ ges .
in 198@@ 9 , i ent@@ ered the bri@@ tish foreign service .
michael san@@ del . thank you so much .
we actually have california and ne@@ v@@ ada covered , and we &apos;ve got the eastern se@@ abo@@ ard from boston to d@@ .c. covered .
whether you &apos;re an artist , a technolog@@ ist , a law@@ yer or a fan , the hand@@ ling of copyright directly imp@@ acts your life .
so i &apos;m not saying , &quot; be like us , &quot; and &quot; we &apos;re perfect role models , &quot; because we &apos;re not , but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions .
so while other kids were watching si@@ t@@ com@@ s and carto@@ ons , i was watching very es@@ ot@@ eric docum@@ ent@@ ari@@ es made by and about women .
it was a 200@@ -@@ foot diam@@ e@@ ter geo@@ des@@ ic sphere to be suspen@@ ded over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
e@@ ve ens@@ ler : happiness in body and sou@@ l
so , for example , when you look at this image a good graphic invi@@ tes the eye to dar@@ t around , to selec@@ tively create a visual logic .
thank you .
in the world of go@@ d@@ z@@ ill@@ a spi@@ der mit@@ es , we can make millions of mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors , each one-@@ fif@@ th the diam@@ e@@ ter of a human hair , moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen dis@@ plays , so that we can watch movies like &quot; go@@ d@@ z@@ ill@@ a &quot; in high-@@ de@@ f .
when he was born , he was diagn@@ osed with di@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , a very dis@@ ab@@ ling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
well , i was born ... no .
and the truth be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
john ho@@ ck@@ en@@ berry : we are all designers
so that &apos;s what this figure shows you .
what you &apos;ve done is you &apos;ve out@@ lin@@ ed all the negative things that can happen , but not talked about the positive . &quot;
and yeah , you really can .
and li@@ ke@@ wise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , &quot; would you not vote for a quali@@ fied black president ? &quot;
the same appli@@ es to edu@@ cat@@ ors .
i felt so suff@@ oc@@ ated that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of starvation .
this woman is slowly dying because the ben@@ ig@@ n tumor@@ s in her fac@@ ial bones have completely ob@@ liter@@ ated her mouth and her nose so she can &apos;t breathe and eat .
in a huge amount of de@@ bt person@@ ally to this expedition , and lying on my m@@ um &apos;s so@@ f@@ a , day in day out , watching day@@ time tv .
we &apos;ll apply that throughout our global supply chain regar@@ d@@ less of ow@@ ner@@ ship or control .
and when they get really happy about this , we go ahead and st@@ ym@@ ie them .
and my brazi@@ lian friends tell me that if i just t@@ we@@ et the p@@ hr@@ ase &quot; cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , gal@@ va@@ o , &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
and the only b@@ old colors are the reds of the p@@ anic bu@@ tt@@ ons .
is there any other ray of light that could make into the obser@@ ver &apos;s eye from that galaxy ?
now i know you don &apos;t think that .
it &apos;s kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don &apos;t spend it very wi@@ sel@@ y , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
so i hope this will help us make better pri@@ orities , and think about how we better work for the world .
except , of course , what &apos;s interesting about this is that we can &apos;t be sure how that idea was con@@ ve@@ yed , because the homo erec@@ tus that made these objects did not have language .
le@@ yma@@ h , thank you . thank you so much for coming to ted .
it was all these things .
what &apos;s the idea behind it ?
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
and pretty soon , the average price was 19@@ 2 dollars .
we &apos;re looking a lot at this . this is spre@@ ading everywhere .
in reality , it is one of its greatest alli@@ es .
you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here .
what has that cost the world ? let &apos;s take a look at that .
they are supposed to be lo@@ cked up .
so simil@@ arly , the control is flo@@ wing in the ow@@ ner@@ ship networks and is acc@@ um@@ ulating at the no@@ des .
we wrote about her in the new york times .
that inclu@@ des ki@@ dn@@ apping , prostit@@ ution , local drug de@@ aling and human traff@@ i@@ cking , including of migr@@ ants that go from the south to the u.s .
we &apos;ve been fo@@ ol@@ ed by our tool .
derek si@@ vers invented c@@ d baby , which allowed independent musi@@ cians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man -- to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to , and connect with each other .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
but we estimate that about one in three bit@@ es of food we eat is directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly poll@@ in@@ ated by hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es .
what we did was we formul@@ ated recip@@ es -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .
you may be surprised to know that eight speak@@ ers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks .
what we &apos;re asking about though is human ance@@ stry .
and there are a lot of people doing this , a lot of syn@@ thetic bi@@ ologists doing this , like cra@@ ig vent@@ er .
and this is very critical stuff .
so within the team , their interest@@ s are actually pit@@ ted against each other .
let &apos;s go and try and talk to the head@@ mi@@ stress .
and the same with the &quot; @ &quot; sign that we ac@@ qui@@ red a few years ago .
i know that one k@@ is@@ s could take away all my decisi@@ on-@@ making ability .
i &apos;m a creative technolog@@ ist and the focus of my work is on public instal@@ lations .
and that to pur@@ su@@ e one real@@ m to the dis@@ reg@@ ard of the other , is to open on@@ es@@ el@@ f to ultimate sa@@ dness in older age .
we can easily go back to the hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de world .
i think this project gives us a glimp@@ se of the un@@ seen objects that a@@ wait us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object , but a process to generate objects .
if you &apos;re against , put up one .
unlike any po@@ p culture phenomenon before it , video games actually allow us to become part of the machine .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just as much about the identi@@ ty of the living as it is about remem@@ br@@ ance of the dead .
and so some people kn@@ it together the networks around them , creating a kind of den@@ se web of ties in which they &apos;re comfort@@ ably embedded .
and how we manage our built environment affec@@ ts the health and well-@@ being of people every single day .
lying just ben@@ e@@ ath the surface of those argu@@ ments , with passi@@ ons ra@@ ging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosoph@@ y , big questions of justice .
here &apos;s what he said .
the beat@@ les did not inv@@ ent teenagers .
this is my multi@@ tasking activity result .
it does hur@@ t . and we rein@@ force the stor@@ y@@ line , right ?
but also , through mechanisms that we don &apos;t fully understand , people who are lon@@ ely and depres@@ sed are many times -- three to five to ten times , in some studies -- more likely to get sick and die pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely .
thank you very much .
out of that conference , inci@@ dent@@ ally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they &apos;re having to work at home , for example , in a no@@ is@@ y kitchen .
and he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the world wide web .
zo@@ e : five of diam@@ on@@ ds , yeah .
this is the top car@@ ni@@ vor@@ e , the t-@@ re@@ x of its time .
two years ago , she gradu@@ ated from connec@@ tic@@ ut college .
another aspe@@ ct of con@@ temporary design that i think is min@@ d-@@ opening , promis@@ ing and will really be the future of design , is the idea of colle@@ ctive design .
you know , we had to be taught to ren@@ o@@ un@@ ce the powerful conser@@ vation eth@@ ic we developed during the great depression and world war ii .
pa@@ stor steve : an inspi@@ rational man , one of my early alli@@ es in hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton , west virginia .
but scienti@@ fically , they &apos;re amazing because they &apos;re sent@@ in@@ els .
every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard oli@@ via &apos;s talk about the sexual hab@@ its , you &apos;ll realize that there isn &apos;t anything we can say that &apos;s true for all life , because every single one of them is hac@@ king something about it .
since he was a great teacher , len@@ ny bern@@ stein always started from the meaning . look at this , please .
why is this market worth getting at over here ?
and then twi@@ tter came along , and made things even more magic , because i could ask inst@@ antly for anything anywhere .
this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now , but i hope they will in the future .
this is the year of the wo@@ unded kne@@ e m@@ ass@@ acre .
we introduced the mon@@ keys to two new mon@@ key sal@@ es@@ men .
in fact it was so bad that most of the hor@@ ses died before they could get where they were going .
so it &apos;s not necessary , thank god , that the fo@@ w@@ ler apple is the best apple in the world .
so here my friends gene and ga@@ il had not heard from me in about a year , and suddenly i was call@@ ing , saying &quot; i &apos;m in korea , and i &apos;ve met this extraordinary girl . &quot;
he has re@@ ga@@ ined his full dignity thanks to that job .
i mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that &apos;s not why they &apos;re in the city , and that &apos;s not what they care about .
how do we search for alien life if it &apos;s nothing like the life that we know ? christ@@ op@@ h ad@@ ami shows how he uses his research into arti@@ ficial life -- self-@@ rep@@ lic@@ ating computer program@@ s -- to find a sig@@ nature , a &apos; biom@@ ar@@ ker , &apos; that is free of our pre@@ conc@@ ep@@ tions of what life is . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and so if you hear an exper@@ t talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skep@@ tic@@ ism that you might treat the comm@@ ents of an economist about the economy or a wea@@ ther@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
i said , &quot; yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot;
so , it is the idea of sequen@@ cing all of the genes in the cancer , and giving us a new le@@ x@@ ic@@ on , a new dic@@ tionary to describe it .
so , the science is changing .
and no matter where i am or what i &apos;m doing , i &apos;ve got to do that .
and what i &apos;ve done is i organized them into various categories .
there has been much disc@@ ussed in the last few years about the ris@@ ing cost of health care .
i went off on my own to become an artist , and i pain@@ ted for 10 years , when i was off@@ ered a ful@@ bright to india .
so that &apos;s kind of a b@@ old statement .
so -- &quot; the hu@@ t was made of cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated metal , set on a con@@ cre@@ te pad .
you can ask , how do you st@@ ack up for positive emo@@ tion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
what i &apos;ve been talking to you about so far is mental dis@@ orders , diseases of the mind .
which also , i think , gets into a little bit of our current idea .
and what we changed was not people &apos;s moral judg@@ ments when they &apos;re deci@@ ding what to do , when they &apos;re making action cho@@ ices .
and he wrote to the acade@@ mi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
and the goo@@ d@@ will of the mark@@ et@@ place is aston@@ ishing .
and i &apos;m now going to make it visible to you in your minds .
we evolved as a species near the equ@@ ator , and so we &apos;re very well-@@ equi@@ pped to deal with 12 hours of day@@ light and 12 hours of dar@@ k@@ ness .
and i had two questions in my head .
and this is one of the the@@ mes that i &apos;m talking about is we can em@@ power ourselves to do the things that doctors can &apos;t do for us , which is to use knowledge and take action .
this is a clim@@ b in the nee@@ d@@ les , again in california .
and because of that , i always wonder@@ ed about this human thing .
now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
and it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogni@@ tively demand@@ ing professi@@ ons .
and that &apos;s very charac@@ teri@@ stic of humans and it &apos;s called childhood , which is this ex@@ tended depen@@ dence of human children on their family or parents .
this is a very good year .
except for flo@@ oring .
september 11 gener@@ ated some interest in moving it over to ground zero , and i &apos;m totally against that .
now we &apos;re in t@@ ough times econom@@ ically .
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be rel@@ ie@@ ved to hear .
there is no escape hat@@ ch .
you just twi@@ st leaves , and you see a whole new world of minute insects , or little spi@@ ders of one milli@@ meter , one and a half , two milli@@ meters long , and you can dist@@ ingu@@ ish between the good ones and the bad ones .
and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio .
so i just cop@@ i@@ ed and pa@@ sted from my r@@ é@@ sum@@ é .
these are two genes that we found as good examples .
but it was important to create a perfect place , so i tried to , in order to work and create .
but back to animals and jun@@ k food .
and these five ways , which we put onto these handy post@@ cards , i would say , don &apos;t have to cost the earth .
so he said , &quot; okay , i get the point . &quot;
so to address this , we studied uk versus ar@@ a@@ v@@ ind .
hans rosling : religi@@ ons and babies
i &apos;ve taught myself to se@@ w , co@@ ok , fix plum@@ bing , build fur@@ ni@@ ture , i can even p@@ at myself on the back when necessary , all so i don &apos;t have to ask anyone for anything .
this is again , something &#91; we were able to see &#93; by virtu@@ e of the fact that we had a radio trans@@ mit@@ ter in one of the s@@ na@@ kes .
because our gut is connected to our emotional li@@ m@@ bi@@ c system , they do speak with each other and make decisions .
but then , of course , the consumer says that doesn &apos;t really matter .
other products cost less . other products had more fe@@ atures .
and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can &apos;t go , we &apos;d need an aircraft small enough and man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able enough to do so .
they p@@ in a me@@ dal on his ch@@ est . he goes home to a ti@@ cker t@@ ape par@@ ade .
how can we begin to understand the way the brain works ? the same way we begin to understand a city : by making a map . in this vis@@ ually st@@ unning talk , all@@ an jones shows how his team is m@@ apping which genes are turned on in each tiny region , and how it all conne@@ cts up .
it &apos;ll be a happy by@@ product that we &apos;ll all benefit .
but i have also recogni@@ zed , in the course of seeing that violence , that being in the face of things and seeing actually what &apos;s in front of us is the anti@@ do@@ te to depression and to a feeling that one is wor@@ th@@ less and has no value .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
number two , all of the 99 , when they first get their stone , or their power , ab@@ use it ; they use it for self-@@ interest .
a re@@ cent study from &#91; university of mich@@ ig@@ an &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relation@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ management tools .
people like food produc@@ ers and farmers are still not aware of this problem .
that &apos;s why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .
so , i &apos;m an artist .
and you can tell an aw@@ ful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossi@@ ls , from the shape of the mus@@ cle atta@@ ch@@ ments , something about the way they lived from the various arti@@ facts found with them .
and what we &apos;re actually really concerned with is this first three hours .
so what are we going to do about that ?
let &apos;s get off our fan@@ ni@@ es , roll up our sle@@ ev@@ es and get to work , passi@@ on@@ ately , in creating an almost perfect world .
now , there is a man on top of his job .
now , how does the most powerful country in the world handle these dis@@ placed people ?
well , i &apos;m a biolog@@ ist . i &apos;m an or@@ ni@@ th@@ ologist .
and we don &apos;t want to have this argument .
they made , so far as we can tell , 9@@ 00 of them .
anyway , here &apos;s number one .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
we just obser@@ ved how self-@@ organized cour@@ ses were kind of sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously spa@@ w@@ ning out of our materials .
my seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the ma@@ il@@ box .
this is exactly analo@@ g@@ ous to the question , what &apos;s the sm@@ all@@ est program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word ?
and i was obser@@ ving what happened to people and their families over the course of their ter@@ min@@ al illness .
we imp@@ ort 90 percent of our food , and we only cul@@ tiv@@ ate less than one percent of our land .
and then an en@@ zy@@ me in its di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve tra@@ ct le@@ e@@ ches into the be@@ ans , and people with the un@@ en@@ vi@@ able job of colle@@ cting these cats &apos; lea@@ vings then go through the forest colle@@ cting the , you know , results and process@@ ing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the un@@ process@@ ed form .
he was held ho@@ stage over@@ night in the sta@@ ir@@ well .
2000 years ago , the ro@@ man poet ju@@ ven@@ al said something that today e@@ cho@@ es in the heart of every true mexi@@ can .
and guess what ? if the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory contin@@ ues , look where the amount of people living on $ 1.@@ 25 a day gets to by 20@@ 30 .
in the 199@@ 0s , we saw financial cent@@ ers around the world compe@@ ting for their business , and there was simply no effective mechan@@ ism to prevent money la@@ under@@ ing .
i asked her about that , and she said she meant that she doesn &apos;t want to be married , because , in her opinion , when you get married in b@@ hu@@ tan as a woman , your chan@@ ces to live an independent life kind of end , and so she had no interest in that .
and you can fer@@ re@@ t away at those little sub-@@ questions .
&quot; puppe@@ ts always have to try to be alive , &quot; says ad@@ ri@@ an kohl@@ er of the hand@@ spring puppe@@ t company , a gl@@ ori@@ ously ambi@@ tious trou@@ pe of human and woo@@ den ac@@ tors . beginning with the tale of a hy@@ en@@ a &apos;s sub@@ tle pa@@ w , puppe@@ te@@ ers kohl@@ er and bas@@ il jones build to the story of their lat@@ est aston@@ ish@@ ment : the wonder@@ fully life@@ -@@ like jo@@ ey , the war horse , who tro@@ ts convin@@ c@@ ingly onto the stage .
maybe reali@@ zing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the super@@ he@@ ated r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic that we see around the im@@ mi@@ gration issue .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; -- and she wonder@@ ed , like all parents who lose children wonder -- &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot;
these are the guys who wrote the first p@@ c virus .
let &apos;s increase the languages they cra@@ w@@ l from seven to 70 , or more .
these are very powerful technologies .
thank you .
they &apos;re cu@@ tting down on de@@ forest@@ ation , and they &apos;ve found a fuel supply that is in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble , infin@@ ite and free at the point of production .
that means keep the ser@@ ver in your hands .
so if you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed by an evil spirit caus@@ ing neuro@@ logic or psychiat@@ ric problems , then the way to treat this is , of course , to make a hole in your sk@@ ull and let the evil spirit escape .
we saw it in sho@@ dh y@@ at@@ ra . every six months we walk in different parts of the country .
and they still remain as i@@ con@@ s of civi@@ c response in the face of shared , un@@ certain , colle@@ ctive threat .
but that &apos;s not what i want to talk about today .
it is stupid that we use two tons of steel , glass and plastic to hau@@ l our sorry selves to the sh@@ opp@@ ing mall .
maybe i should cl@@ ari@@ fy it .
tour@@ ist : i &apos;ve taken my step@@ -@@ daughter here from indi@@ an@@ ap@@ oli@@ s .
okay , we &apos;re nai@@ ve , we &apos;re bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ e@@ yed and bus@@ hy@@ -@@ tail@@ ed .
these blo@@ cks represent le@@ ds .
however , the ine@@ qualities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of fund@@ ing pose a real risk for explo@@ it@@ ation , especially in the context of exter@@ n@@ all@@ y-@@ fund@@ ed research .
did you do anything else ?
i have behind this wall a dis@@ k drive , a c@@ p@@ u , a graphi@@ cs card , a memory system .
if he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
thank you .
i really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; i &apos;m great , &quot; because that kind of sounds nar@@ cis@@ si@@ stic , and then i won &apos;t have any friends .
this is an unbelie@@ vable light show .
and the c@@ and@@ le wa@@ x was dirty , and we couldn &apos;t image through the wa@@ x .
this is the head@@ band that goes with this al@@ arm clo@@ ck .
and so we &apos;re trying to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate information about the importance of the can@@ op@@ y , the beauty of the can@@ op@@ y , the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty of int@@ act can@@ op@@ ies , to people outside of acade@@ mia .
and talking about war , my gir@@ l@@ friend has this great t-@@ s@@ hir@@ t that says , &quot; bom@@ bing for peace is like fu@@ cking for virg@@ in@@ ity . &quot;
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regu@@ lation of dangerous technologies .
these things that we &apos;re used to with for@@ ums don &apos;t exist on 4@@ ch@@ an .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop poll@@ u@@ ting gro@@ und@@ water as a matter of course , or emplo@@ ying 1@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds as a matter of course , just because ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives wo@@ ke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
and in just four weeks , the brain lear@@ ns to process this new sen@@ sation and ac@@ qu@@ ires a new sensory path@@ way -- like a new sense .
im : yeah , exactly .
but as soon as the figh@@ ting intensi@@ fied , the physical rehabilitation was suspen@@ ded .
we got a lot of things right .
in liter@@ ary cri@@ tic@@ ism and analysis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , liter@@ ary cri@@ tics were a kind of cultural her@@ o ; now they &apos;re kind of a national joke .
they said , &quot; if we paid you six weeks &apos; sal@@ ary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dum@@ p in your community ? &quot;
and it is a mar@@ vel@@ ous rain forest .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
and i decided that i was going to go to school . so i did .
it seriously thre@@ at@@ ens the li@@ vel@@ i@@ ho@@ ods of millions of people , and especially in africa and china .
charles wh@@ it@@ man was his name .
i have to do a little bit more back@@ ground reading , but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given -- per body mass . so , really incredible forces .
it &apos;s made by speci@@ alized lu@@ thi@@ ers , also in europe .
so for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to lo@@ c@@ alize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centi@@ meters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
so , social invest@@ ments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in india and china .
like a wi@@ de-@@ e@@ yed kid , i &apos;d say , &quot; why is that ? &quot;
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deep@@ est secret that maybe millions of people are em@@ powered to help improve it .
they wanted to replace scri@@ p@@ ture with culture .
the more connected i became , the more responsible i felt , the less i was able to let go in your pres@@ ence .
i could imagine grand@@ mothers being able to do soci@@ al-@@ plays with their grand@@ daugh@@ ters , with their friends , and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house , like sharing a bed@@ time story .
the thing is , no one had ever seen it before in nature .
i know no women , whether they &apos;re at home or whether they &apos;re in the work@@ force , who don &apos;t feel that sometimes .
our employe@@ e tur@@ no@@ ver dropped to one-@@ third of the industry average , and during that five year d@@ ot@@ com b@@ ust , we tri@@ pl@@ ed in size .
and so what we do is , we start simple and we work our way up to living systems .
however , if i ask your minds to focus currently on pakistan , and i ask you to think of the sym@@ b@@ ols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think beyond perhaps the ass@@ ass@@ ination of ben@@ a@@ zi@@ r b@@ hu@@ t@@ to .
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for o@@ verl@@ aps , and you basically mat@@ ch them at the ed@@ ges . and i said , &quot; this is kind of like a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle , except the pieces over@@ la@@ p . &quot;
so i &apos;m happy to get a chance to tell you about it .
the name might not be much different , but the ima@@ gery sure is .
so this is one example that i want to show you here .
and if we don &apos;t teach our children to be alone , they &apos;re only going to know how to be lon@@ ely .
you &apos;ve got be an@@ xi@@ ous .
&apos;@@ it &apos;s a simple life , but nobody is re@@ stri@@ cting you .
it &apos;s like the essen@@ ce of ted .
well , one may have been gros@@ s sal@@ es , one may have been net sal@@ es , but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together .
and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do .
l@@ g : yes ? you see that in the screen ?
we had just had a military cou@@ p , and soldiers were per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve in our society .
the memor@@ able , i think , is really our world , what we think the world is .
here &apos;s another story .
it takes a lot of weight , and it follo@@ ws the classi@@ cal design rules .
if we were speaking mandar@@ in chinese with each other , though , i wouldn &apos;t have that lux@@ ury .
it &apos;s a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
it &apos;s closer than you think . it &apos;s kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no oper@@ a@@ tional powered li@@ ft aircraft .
his counter@@ part is not colle@@ ge-@@ edu@@ cated and works as a labor@@ er , works as a cl@@ er@@ k , does low-@@ level white col@@ lar or blue col@@ lar work in the economy .
i &apos;m here to talk about what we should do .
you also have to be very professional .
and like air@@ p@@ ort traffic control , as they start to go past us they &apos;re called back -- and they &apos;re called back and back and back .
and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth , right ?
it &apos;s not about the shap@@ es , it &apos;s how the shap@@ es refle@@ ct light .
and as a gol@@ fer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of se@@ ep@@ ed into my por@@ es , that i sort of lived my whole life , is process .
it &apos;s our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well .
it is amazing . so we are in the 21@@ st century , and we still cannot proper@@ ly understand the spectrum of the sun .
pretty elegant . nothing like a crash to end a joke . that comple@@ tes my o@@ eu@@ v@@ re .
you still see the be@@ es@@ wa@@ x dri@@ pping . when they dropped , they se@@ aled it .
with p@@ ity , you know . sa@@ dness .
j@@ m : now this was used over a million times on the first day , and this is really the best of all the qu@@ eri@@ es .
so it &apos;s the consci@@ ous e@@ mu@@ lation of life &apos;s genius .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider , we may be able to see whether nature uses this e@@ 8 pattern or a different one .
and a small part of my brain is thinking , &apos; that is so gros@@ s and really dangerous , &apos; but most of my brain is thinking , &apos; please let there be some s@@ ma@@ ck left by the time it gets to me .
okay , so that &apos;s the l@@ ens .
speaking of humans , there are currently 7 billion of us on earth .
in pla@@ in english , that means cen@@ sor@@ ship and sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce of their users .
and it was den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
but i con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also save another jos@@ ep@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other jos@@ e@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survive .
and then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosi@@ ons !
we &apos;re going to win because the te@@ ars that come from our eyes actually come from our hear@@ ts .
as kids are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning to code , but even more importantly , they &apos;re co@@ ding to learn .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
and they &apos;ve been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a ra@@ w deal .
and we also had to be as under the ra@@ dar screen as we could be in new york , because the key was not rais@@ ing a lot of obje@@ ction and sort of working as quie@@ tly as possible .
school , same thing .
now , is this some kind of fan@@ ci@@ ful analo@@ gy , or could we actually learn something from this ?
and we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in by a factor of 100,000 times to ob@@ tain the resol@@ ution , so that we can see the bran@@ ches of neurons all at the same time .
they &apos;re res@@ ili@@ ent ; their re@@ dun@@ dan@@ cy is built into this fab@@ ul@@ ous de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized design .
you could play games with it . you could program it in basic .
san@@ ja@@ y da@@ sto@@ or : a sk@@ at@@ e@@ board , with a bo@@ ost
i want somebody who knows , who can change the world out there .
because i think stories are vital here .
it &apos;s about space . it &apos;s not about fashion .
he &apos;s built schools to teach children to care for the forest .
i &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny .
and they don &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b you ?
maybe i can work tomorrow , but i don &apos;t know if and when yet . &quot;
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
which would seem to suggest that ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d was entirely the business of men .
and quite t@@ ell@@ ingly , some musli@@ ms do practice that .
it &apos;s a hal@@ f-@@ whis@@ per , &quot; god , i miss her . &quot;
but derek , your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bas@@ h@@ ed it , bas@@ h@@ ed it so hard they thought it was going to break .
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible .
and you can actually -- -- we won &apos;t get into that .
and the vol@@ v@@ o is doing quite fine .
why don &apos;t you have the arti@@ ficial legs ? &quot;
it might well be that there are environmental factors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we &apos;re not aware of .
cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia brea@@ ze@@ al : the rise of personal robots
it could be on your ro@@ of , or in your back@@ y@@ ard , or somewhere else .
you cannot take people &apos;s ali@@ ens away from them and expect to be anybody &apos;s friends .
well i think you probably already have the picture .
but i can live up to that . i don &apos;t have a problem with that .
if it wasn &apos;t able to stre@@ tch so much , then basically when an inse@@ ct hit the web , it would just trampol@@ ine right off of it .
and the thing is that he found two tex@@ ts in this man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt that were unique tex@@ ts .
but if you have children , you know it doesn &apos;t often work that way .
and you &apos;d think , &quot; can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? &quot;
this is going to affect everything .
that &apos;s where those arti@@ facts are coming from .
and that &apos;s basically what &apos;s going on in your brain right now as you &apos;re watching this .
i moved there pri@@ mar@@ ily to be part of a learning environment that v@@ ali@@ dated the way that i knew that kids learned , and that really wanted to investi@@ gate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the para@@ dig@@ ms of the past , of information scar@@ city when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school , and to a moment when we have information sur@@ plus .
r@@ w : do i get to hold them ?
perhaps there are many such places -- again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the moral landscape .
this guy &apos;s a good argu@@ er .
they don &apos;t all have dru@@ m@@ sticks .
everybody : i am my connec@@ t@@ ome .
so , let me close -- let me close with my two ap@@ hor@@ is@@ ms .
thank you .
to build our development , we come to a huge con@@ tradi@@ ction that we destro@@ y around us everything .
they spent the 199@@ 0s working the mess@@ y sc@@ ene between glob@@ alized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap .
rather than spending their lives eating gr@@ ass , for which their stom@@ ach@@ s were designed , they were forced to eat so@@ y and cor@@ n .
the limit@@ ation was that they didn &apos;t have any money .
let &apos;s change the narra@@ tive together and let &apos;s start ri@@ gh@@ ting writing wr@@ on@@ gs .
no , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos , right ?
for example , commun@@ ality appli@@ es most naturally within family or friends , but it can be used to try to transfer the ment@@ ality of sharing to groups that ordin@@ arily would not be dis@@ posed to exer@@ cise it .
the cli@@ ents have asked us to produce a great ch@@ am@@ ber music h@@ all .
and i kind of got a handle on it .
it &apos;s saying , &quot; let &apos;s mar@@ ch . &quot; thank you very much .
a means to determine if there &apos;s a complete blo@@ ck@@ age of a cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery .
now , at least with see@@ ds we have the potential for future life .
but it &apos;s not only about the front page .
this only started about 150 years ago .
you were a free market cap@@ ital@@ ist economist or you were a key@@ n@@ es@@ ian liberal economist , and these people didn &apos;t go to each other &apos;s we@@ dd@@ ings , they s@@ nu@@ b@@ bed each other at con@@ fer@@ ences .
and i &apos;d want one that could pass and would pass .
as essential as it is across our tradi@@ tions , as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives , the word &quot; compassion &quot; is hol@@ lo@@ wed out in our culture , and it is suspe@@ ct in my field of journal@@ ism .
and not only did those su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bom@@ bers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hat@@ red , more ra@@ ge , more fear and certainly des@@ pa@@ ir .
one of them is the requi@@ rement for econom@@ ical ear@@ th-@@ to-@@ space transport .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
argu@@ ably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is fail@@ ing us , and yet i stand fir@@ m@@ ly with the optimi@@ sts who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive .
it was a little bit too funk@@ y , and we wanted a more femin@@ ine point of view and emplo@@ yed a du@@ ck who did it in a much more fit@@ ting way -- fashion .
and just like the pol@@ ar be@@ ars , these animals dep@@ end on an ic@@ y environment .
if you expand that out to think of a whole community , or all your employees in your company , you begin to realize how limited the tam@@ i@@ flu option might be .
in the su@@ fi faith , this great middle eastern religion , which some cla@@ im is the rou@@ te of all religi@@ ons , su@@ fi ma@@ sters are all tele@@ pa@@ ths , so they say .
there &apos;s a shor@@ tage of radi@@ ologists quali@@ fied to read mammo@@ grams , and that &apos;s because mammo@@ grams are one of the most complex of all radi@@ ology studies to interpre@@ t , and because radi@@ ologists are su@@ ed more often over mis@@ sed breast cancer than any other cause .
thanks . thank you .
in the fashion industry , there &apos;s very little intellectual property protection .
in fact , 65 deci@@ bel@@ s is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that , that is the threshold for the dan@@ ger of m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ al in@@ far@@ ction .
they also leg@@ is@@ late on cor@@ re@@ ct us@@ age , such as the pro@@ per term for what the french call &quot; email , &quot; which ought to be &quot; cour@@ ri@@ el . &quot;
do you know , we &apos;re bringing little babies into a world where , in many places , the water is po@@ is@@ on@@ ing them ?
so a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called &quot; not ready to die in your war . &quot;
and finally number 10 , last and certainly not least , ran@@ jan@@ i she@@ t@@ tar , who lives and works here in the state of kar@@ nat@@ aka , creates e@@ there@@ al sculp@@ tures and instal@@ lations that really mar@@ ry the organic to the industrial , and brings , like su@@ bo@@ dh , the local global .
we don &apos;t need to inv@@ ent solutions because we have them -- c@@ ash flow lo@@ ans based in income rather than asse@@ ts , lo@@ ans that use se@@ cure contra@@ cts rather than coll@@ at@@ er@@ al , because women often don &apos;t own land .
ut@@ tar pra@@ des@@ h , the biggest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of india .
that is why we train police off@@ ic@@ ers , we train jud@@ ges , we train public pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors around the world .
you know of &quot; the mar@@ ch of the pengu@@ ins . &quot;
because i feel an ur@@ gen@@ cy about this .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , gui@@ ded by a small number of simple principles .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
so , this is actually a health@@ ier ci@@ gar@@ ette .
they could be commun@@ ist , they could be liberal , they could be fas@@ cist or islam@@ ic .
i just do that to make money .
now , you &apos;re all thinking , yeah , what about the brain tissue ?
so we had a few ka@@ ya@@ ks .
and my mother was a kind of a designer , also .
for as long as i can remember , i have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean .
now , van go@@ gh doesn &apos;t know anything about physics , but i think it &apos;s very interesting that there was some work done to show that this ed@@ dy pattern in this painting follo@@ wed a statisti@@ cal model of tur@@ bul@@ ence , which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head .
so there &apos;s tom , dick and har@@ ry and they &apos;re working construction .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m really worried about .
she took him to the v@@ et and the v@@ et discovered something quite dis@@ gu@@ sting .
i mean they have much larger vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
number three : don &apos;t read your speech .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easier solution to this .
i said , &quot; no . &quot;
dogs are the result of selec@@ tively bre@@ e@@ ding tra@@ its that we like .
because we &apos;ve solved the problem in ch@@ u@@ but pro@@ vin@@ ce , which is like a state in argent@@ ina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &apos;s about 1,000 kilometers of co@@ ast@@ line -- but we haven &apos;t solved the problem in northern argent@@ ina , uruguay and brazil .
su@@ z@@ an@@ ne , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re we@@ aring is not random .
and i refer@@ enced that at the end of my last talk .
and , you know , you can &apos;t fau@@ lt him for accur@@ acy .
it &apos;s been running for about a year and a half .
my name is ron@@ ny e@@ dry , and i &apos;m 4@@ 1 , i &apos;m an isra@@ el@@ i , i &apos;m a father of two , i &apos;m a hus@@ band , and i &apos;m a graphic designer . i &apos;m teaching graphic design .
and we request them .
it &apos;s also about environment and respect .
at least , it &apos;s powerful enough that if i show you these four songs , and i re@@ mind you that this is &quot; sm@@ ells like te@@ en spirit , &quot; you can probably cor@@ rec@@ tly guess , without listening to any music at all , that the song a die hard nir@@ van@@ a fan would en@@ joy is this song , &quot; i &apos;ll stick around &quot; by the fo@@ o figh@@ ters , whose lead sing@@ er is da@@ ve gro@@ hl , who was the dru@@ m@@ mer in nir@@ van@@ a .
and over time , these neur@@ al path@@ ways become hard@@ wired , they become the nor@@ m -- even if it &apos;s bad for us because it causes us stress and an@@ xiety .
my father is at once quick@@ -@@ wi@@ tt@@ ed , wick@@ ed@@ ly funny , and then po@@ ig@@ nan@@ cy turns on a di@@ me and leaves you brea@@ th@@ less .
here -- that &apos;s just my new pro@@ pos@@ al here for the union jack .
whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly .
and his mouth must be probably about three mic@@ r@@ ons .
and it is much harder , often , to be compassi@@ onate towards those clos@@ est to us , which is another quality in the universe of compassion , on its dark side , that also deser@@ ves our serious attention and ill@@ um@@ ination .
&quot; if &apos; philosop@@ her@@ s &apos; is taken to be too wide and lo@@ f@@ ty a term , &quot; he said , &quot; then , by analo@@ gy with &apos; artist , &apos; we may form &apos; scientist . &apos; &quot; this was the first time the word scientist was ut@@ tered in public , only 17@@ 9 years ago .
and hal@@ f@@ way through the project , skep@@ tics said , &quot; well , this is not working out . you &apos;re hal@@ f@@ way through the genome project and you &apos;ve finished one percent of the project . &quot;
and so they went and studied 10 day@@ care cent@@ ers in ha@@ i@@ f@@ a , israel .
am@@ y win@@ e@@ house said , &quot; nel@@ son mand@@ ela and i have a lot in common .
i &apos;m pass@@ ing some co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ches around . take a look at their feet .
but i don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional bag@@ ga@@ ge .
right ? you &apos;re sitting down . you &apos;re looking at your iphone -- or your andro@@ id , not trying to leave anyone out .
this is violence .
music is life .
the real challenge then , is to try to figure out how we can change rules .
and as i grew older , i then audi@@ tioned for the royal acade@@ my of music in london , and they said , &quot; well , no , we won &apos;t acc@@ ept you , because we haven &apos;t a cl@@ ue , you know , of the future of a so@@ -@@ called &apos; de@@ af &apos; musi@@ cian . &quot;
so the or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c center was clos@@ ed because physical rehabilitation was not consi@@ dered a pri@@ ority .
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years , and what i learned when i came to the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wil@@ d@@ life , and the amazing qualities that pengu@@ ins have .
birds have basically ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ta@@ ils .
re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ o@@ od allows for an evol@@ ving and dynamic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to encoura@@ ge its res@@ ili@@ ency .
number one that i get asked : what do you eat ?
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecu@@ lar level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
this is effective around the world . the access to smart@@ phones and cell phones today is extraordinary .
we did it . he provided us d@@ ust monit@@ ors .
so , recently , i worked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive named jo@@ e , and jo@@ e worked for a medical device company .
and then , of course , the next year it comes ro@@ aring back .
the good thing about this is , if the conc@@ ert doesn &apos;t sound good , it &apos;s their fau@@ lt .
here in the united states , i think you see it in this election campaign : a lon@@ ging for change .
in most of the world , these few pre@@ vention fail@@ ures not@@ with@@ standing , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : con@@ dom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries .
he asked me if i wanted to inter@@ view the red bri@@ ga@@ des .
and as i said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren &apos;t teachers to make this model work .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a co@@ ast down@@ h@@ ill .
so , when the log@@ ging cam@@ p moves , there &apos;s nothing left .
that means building the entire , the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the u.s. in 15 years .
well he had a wonderful expression , but only one .
and they made this into a game , initi@@ ally .
and so now we can see , is that really a robust sig@@ nature ?
they &apos;re just not moving .
d@@ ale dou@@ g@@ her@@ ty : these are electric mu@@ ff@@ ins .
but this is what emer@@ ged out of it , in the end .
that &apos;s a piece of history , but it comes in a mathematical wr@@ apping .
and they have increased the security with long-term land le@@ as@@ es .
but , you know , nasa scre@@ wed that up because they &apos;ve sent these robots and they &apos;ve land@@ ed it only in the deser@@ ts .
j@@ on ron@@ son : strange answers to the psych@@ op@@ ath test
now , while i was at microsoft , the an@@ nu@@ al re@@ ven@@ ues of that company grew larger than the g@@ dp of the re@@ public of ghana .
you and i know deeper down , there &apos;s always a chance to win the cro@@ wn .
and something else happened instead .
number one group on me@@ e@@ tu@@ p right now , most chap@@ ters in most cities with most members , most active ?
so , what is simp@@ li@@ city ?
and this se@@ at@@ b@@ elt would have passed with flying colors into being appro@@ ved as a car seat .
your life as you know it goes into suspen@@ ded ani@@ ma@@ tion .
i &apos;m actually going to give you an example of how we do so .
and mind you , i &apos;m six feet half an inch , rat@@ an is t@@ aller than me , and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car .
so we could say , well , a new figure comes out ... let &apos;s see african de@@ bt .
now compassion , when it ent@@ ers the news , too often comes in the form of feel@@ -@@ good feature pieces or si@@ de@@ bars about hero@@ ic people you could never be like or happy end@@ ings or examples of self-@@ s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goo@@ ds have become com@@ modi@@ ti@@ zed .
you see under a micros@@ cope .
they were clu@@ eless .
so as an example of why this has been -- or how this can be important : we recently had a situation where a ne@@ o-@@ na@@ z@@ i website discovered wikipedia , and they said , &quot; oh , well , this is horrible , this jewish con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy of a website and we &apos;re going to get certain articles del@@ et@@ ed that we don &apos;t like .
and then this is a kind of a sh@@ opp@@ ing mall , with a ro@@ de@@ o and restau@@ ran@@ ts .
but yeah , and it &apos;s great , you can even go , you know -- or we have this poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ st movement for those of you who are into art .
there are a bunch of other of these bi@@ as@@ es , these cognitive bi@@ as@@ es , that affect our risk decisions .
let me talk about a rela@@ tively small number .
but you can also have this great community of city or buil@@ d@@ ing-@@ top bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , these bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers that live -- this is in paris where these bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers live .
i mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos;ve got the word &quot; flu@@ c@@ tus &quot; up there . that &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;ve got over 1,000 species . we have 1@@ 37 bird species as of today .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
and i was actually a ro@@ cket scientist .
i wi@@ shed to photograph the other animals , to photograph the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , to photograph us , but us from the beginning , the time we lived in equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um with nature .

there is now a new career path called sto@@ ol don@@ or .
this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country .
it &apos;s part of our culture , it &apos;s part of our history .
they required sc@@ or@@ es of highly sk@@ ill@@ ed wea@@ vers working over ex@@ tended peri@@ ods of time with very expensive materials -- the wo@@ ols , the sil@@ ks , even gold and sil@@ ver thre@@ ad .

so again , you get this daily e@@ b@@ b and flow of people sen@@ ding sms messa@@ ges from different parts of the city .
and let &apos;s see what his reaction is as he &apos;s headed through 90 degrees here , and now he &apos;s going to -- when he ends up down here , he &apos;s going to be 1@@ 80 degrees in the wrong direction .
and so i came up with this : lab test results .
the same techniques we use for building si@@ lic@@ on computer memor@@ ies , we can use for here .
it &apos;s a sta@@ tic image . how many people see this illu@@ sion ? it &apos;s completely sta@@ tic .
so i go back online now .
and what i wonder@@ ed was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color , so i decided to do a little experiment .
this isn &apos;t a dec@@ ep@@ tion-@@ dete@@ ction machine to tell if your gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s lying to you on text messa@@ ging .
for example , south africa was recently voted as the top dest@@ ination for the top 1,000 uk companies for off@@ sh@@ ore call@@ -@@ cent@@ ers .
but it &apos;s ug@@ ly .
make yourself understood to the computer . &quot;
if you &apos;re in the commun@@ al industry , look at religion and do the commun@@ al bit .
now , what is the point of this ?
and the in@@ genu@@ ity , if you could call it that , goes even further .
and this is von ne@@ um@@ ann and mor@@ gen@@ stern , who wrote the &quot; theory of games . &quot;
this is just european countries , but you do it in japan or china or col@@ om@@ bia , always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree .
they have increased the security of pro@@ pri@@ et@@ ors .
even in ban@@ gla@@ des@@ h , there are some empty places .
here are just some of the biggest movements of people , volun@@ tary movements , in the last 5,000 years .
but i app@@ reci@@ ated the energy , i &apos;ll tell you that .
if you have to work in an open-@@ plan office like this , your productivity is great@@ ly redu@@ ced .
we found that we could discover the cau@@ sation of the positive states , the relationship between left he@@ mis@@ pher@@ ic activity and right he@@ mis@@ pher@@ ic activity as a cause of happiness .
i found ner@@ u@@ da scri@@ b@@ bl@@ ed on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahri@@ r , and i decided to take a no of mam@@ lu@@ k m@@ aus@@ o@@ le@@ um in ca@@ ir@@ o .
a@@ vel@@ ile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
accur@@ acy , we know from histor@@ ical recor@@ ds that sl@@ ing@@ ers -- experi@@ enced sl@@ ing@@ ers could hit and ma@@ im or even kill a target at distan@@ ces of up to 200 y@@ ar@@ ds .
he gives them a platform ; he gives them some rules ; he gives them the tools and then he kind of or@@ che@@ str@@ ates the conversation ; he or@@ che@@ str@@ ates the action .
but if the chinese government interven@@ es , it might even be a p@@ anda .
it was designed some 150 years ago .
and there &apos;s tremendous sc@@ op@@ e for addi@@ tional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , i &apos;m afraid .
so anyway , let me change pace a little bit .
in south korea and indones@@ ia , women own nearly half a million fir@@ ms .
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the homo erec@@ tus , did .
so , here &apos;s a woman that reser@@ ved mini@@ mia , and she had her day .
and that &apos;s one of the things that bill &apos;s been doing , is provi@@ ding scientists with this first view of animals like this , in the world where they bel@@ ong .
and that &apos;s not fair .
we said , so we &apos;ll put in a stent , but we &apos;re not going to put in a stent that we &apos;d put in people .
so life was much more creative than we had ever thought .
this voice does not repe@@ at for six months .
well if you look at the ma@@ cr@@ o level , it seems more money , more hiv .
it &apos;s all like french van@@ ill@@ a ice cre@@ am , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you &apos;re down to the six@@ th taste , it &apos;s gone .
their eyes just gla@@ ze over , all right ?
this is the report from &#91; the &#93; u.n. , which came out on fri@@ day .
we &apos;ve given this person a name .
happy to take your questions .
we really showed that , yes , we can .
it &apos;s very difficult for a politi@@ cian , because you &apos;re afraid that many lives have been lost in va@@ in .
me was comp@@ osed of stories , of cra@@ vings , of stri@@ vings , of des@@ ires of the future .
and it &apos;ll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .
at the san die@@ go zoo , his fro@@ zen zoo has collected the tissu@@ es from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years .
it creates a magne@@ tic field here .
pick a foot and try to watch a to@@ e , and see if you can see what the animal &apos;s doing .
i still drive the same four@@ -year-old ford that i &apos;ve driven .
we started in &apos; 83 , pro@@ pos@@ ing for the city of rio how to connect the sub@@ way with the bus .
and at some point , chri@@ stian will introduce this note .
dar@@ ren d@@ ust mi@@ te and his family moved in .
scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their su@@ cking when something interest@@ s them and res@@ u@@ me their fast su@@ cking when they get bor@@ ed .
shor@@ tly after , my parents got separated , and i came to tur@@ key with my mom .
the challenge fac@@ ing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of redu@@ cing poverty .
even here in do@@ ha i found this little no@@ ok where you can get al@@ arm clo@@ cks and wat@@ ches fi@@ x@@ ed , and it &apos;s a lot of tiny little parts . it &apos;s not easy .
because to find a place like this today on earth is really very , very challenging .
there are all kinds of benefits to this .
summer , fall , winter , spring , noon , d@@ us@@ k , dark , da@@ wn .
it leaves their children paraly@@ zed , and it dra@@ gs their families deeper into poverty , because they &apos;re des@@ per@@ ately se@@ arch@@ ing and they &apos;re des@@ per@@ ately spending the little bit of sa@@ vings that they have , trying in va@@ in to find a cure for their children .
and toward the end of writing that book there was a docum@@ ent@@ ary that came out .
this is my son tam@@ er . you can see he &apos;s really enjo@@ ying our mathematical trip to the al@@ ham@@ bra .
nothing . this is all going on , and all i &apos;m getting is post@@ cards of these guys in las v@@ eg@@ as , or whatever , saying , &quot; don &apos;t worry chris , this is really going to be good . &quot; ok ?
ac@@ ting with in@@ tent .
when the ice wasn &apos;t fl@@ at , i didn &apos;t have a hope in hell .
if you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to har@@ vard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here because i &apos;m in search of mor@@ ality , gui@@ dance and con@@ sol@@ ation ; i want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the in@@ sane as@@ y@@ l@@ um .
i or@@ dered them ; they came by fe@@ de@@ x .
they have to dig themselves out every day .
i loved watching plan@@ es bar@@ re@@ l over our holi@@ day home in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and as you play p@@ ing-@@ p@@ ong , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ri@@ p@@ ples spread out and the fish run away .
then the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends -- ar@@ ra@@ yed around the bri@@ de like planets around the sun .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for cent@@ uries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that r &amp; amp ; d-@@ i@@ -@@ y has moved beyond just window far@@ ms and le@@ ds into solar panels and aqu@@ ap@@ on@@ ic systems .
so to me , this is the coura@@ ge@@ ous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
we can do this . we &apos;re edu@@ cat@@ ors .
people who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual di@@ vision of labor .
if we &apos;re going to get that , and make that gas station possible , we have to figure out ways to move large vol@@ um@@ es of pay@@ load through space .
really sch@@ ol@@ astic , if you ask me .
we are all in this together .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
we &apos;d love to tag in mon@@ terey .
so , you know , by being able to write a genome and plu@@ g it into an organis@@ m , the software , if you will , changes the hardware .
but there &apos;s still a sort of fil@@ ling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
and to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction , you &apos;re going to live longer , you &apos;re going to feel better , you &apos;re going to lose weight , and so on .
young students are always asking me what these animals are saying , and really i &apos;ve got no idea .
n@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nine p@@ ence was the starting price and no reser@@ ve .
and this is called not@@ es , and this is coming -- basically scar@@ less surgery , as medi@@ ated by robo@@ tic surgery .
we went out and we found some visi@@ on@@ ary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hopefully enough time to get them accep@@ ted .
and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stron@@ ger ene@@ my .
this one was taken at the ex@@ act moment i was down there fil@@ ming those sharks .
re@@ tar@@ ge@@ ting is the process of transp@@ os@@ ing that data onto another model .
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you glimp@@ ses of my personal story .
so what actually works ?
now , you &apos;ve heard about this in terms of nanot@@ echn@@ ology .
i want you to in@@ spe@@ ct its mouth , look at its te@@ eth .
and we need vitamin d@@ . it &apos;s now a requi@@ rement that children have a certain amount .
so how can this be ?
they rein@@ st@@ ated the tradition of the q &amp; amp ; a after scientific pap@@ ers were read , which had been dis@@ continued by the royal society as being ung@@ ent@@ le@@ man@@ ly .
we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among weal@@ thy countries .
do you see the subject ?
so i just really encoura@@ ge you , whatever your sta@@ ke is in education -- whether you &apos;re a student , par@@ ent , teacher , policy maker , whatever -- ins@@ ist on better math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
and this is exactly what happened which anti@@ psycho@@ tic medi@@ cation for schizophren@@ ia .
business , she said , was critical to her country &apos;s future .
you get hundreds of str@@ an@@ gers writing exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly about you .
so , he wouldn &apos;t say much .
i was on bow@@ man lake in glac@@ ier national park , which is a long , sk@@ inn@@ y lake with sort of mountains up@@ side down in it , and my partner and i have a ro@@ wing sh@@ ell .
it became much harder for them to soci@@ alize , much harder for them to cooper@@ ate .
but if you have something that has a function , and it &apos;s really cheap , people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things .
so this created a reser@@ vo@@ ir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reser@@ vo@@ irs ever created .
and that &apos;s what you see here : these little salt sp@@ ots are just dna tac@@ ked onto glass , and so i can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a dete@@ ction re@@ ag@@ ent .
so , i don &apos;t tell you that to bra@@ g ; i tell you because i &apos;m pr@@ ou@@ d of human beings , because they get excited to contribu@@ te once they &apos;ve had the chance to experience it , not talk about it .
in japan , they say that sus@@ hi is challenging .
and if you pull the cor@@ ds under the k@@ not , you will see that the bow ori@@ ents itself along the trans@@ verse axis of the sho@@ e .
although we want to avo@@ id suffering , it seems we are running some@@ what towards it .
the docum@@ entation of this animal goes back to the las@@ cau@@ x ca@@ ve paintings .
so i have sensory input , which i can take in to make belie@@ fs .
oh , isn &apos;t that funny ! there &apos;s another great one over here .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
it was called the &quot; up@@ su@@ ck &quot; theory .
we can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it &apos;s a min@@ i space station .
and i &apos;ve always belie@@ ved that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
i &apos;ll just say , ju@@ ly .
we see , &quot; i feel like i have been at a computer all day . &quot;
thank you .
so , the ant col@@ ony is a great model : you have all these little parts that colle@@ cti@@ vely add up to a great thing .
i &apos;m a pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ologist , but i still knew alco@@ hol was a dna pres@@ er@@ va@@ tive .
so dig@@ ging deeper into this with the science and technology coun@@ cil of the acade@@ my of motion picture arts and sci@@ ences reve@@ als some truth behind the tri@@ ck@@ ery .
it was a very aes@@ thetic ide@@ ology .
and mostly , i want to per@@ su@@ ade you that we have to do better if we &apos;re going to continue the project of civilization in america .
people have pulled asi@@ de , i mean , they &apos;ve come out of that qu@@ eu@@ e line , they have pop@@ ped their tr@@ un@@ ks , pulled out la@@ wn cha@@ irs and cool drin@@ ks .
he dra@@ ws she@@ ep after she@@ ep .
not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard dis@@ ks used to be 3@@ ,@@ 400 dollars for 10 me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes -- exponenti@@ ally che@@ aper .

g@@ ari@@ k isra@@ el@@ ian is a spec@@ tr@@ os@@ cop@@ ist , studying the spectrum em@@ it@@ ted by a star to figure out what it &apos;s made of and how it might be@@ have . it &apos;s a rare and accessi@@ ble look at this discipl@@ ine , which may be coming close to finding a planet friendly to life .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could re@@ generate ?
don &apos;t get me started .
and other children in curiosity come up and po@@ ke the les@@ i@@ on , because -- a natural curiosity .
and guess what ?
this is one of my favorite fe@@ atures in section one .
i basically decided that it was i , not the camera or the network , or anything that la@@ y outside myself , that was the only instrument in stor@@ y@@ telling truly worth tun@@ ing .
this is in this context i &apos;m going to tell you about video games . when we say video games , most of you think about children .
the world turns on symmetry -- from the spin of sub@@ atom@@ ic particles to the di@@ zz@@ ying beauty of an arab@@ es@@ que . but there &apos;s more to it than me@@ ets the eye . here , oxford mathemati@@ cian mar@@ c@@ us du sau@@ to@@ y offers a glimp@@ se of the invisible numbers that mar@@ ry all symme@@ tri@@ cal objects .
it &apos;s easy to think of this analo@@ gy as very different from some of the other things you might pick .
and hand it off to the nurse . she squ@@ ir@@ ts it into a tin .
and that kind of civi@@ c value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation .
you cannot hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter people out of poverty .
from what i &apos;ve seen of ted , i think this may be the ide@@ al place to launch it .
but na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in told me , &quot; listen now , we &apos;re here . &quot;
i want to introduce the cre@@ ators , al@@ ex and daniel , who created this video .
or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women .
so take for inst@@ ance &quot; a gle@@ am of happiness . &quot;
scientific pap@@ ers were published saying it was twi@@ t@@ ching ey@@ el@@ ids that expla@@ ined it , or , you know , a human being &apos;s tendency to see patterns where there are none .
and one of the journ@@ alists said to her , what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;ll walk you , you lead us . &quot;
and that &apos;s the dire@@ ct result of eating a western di@@ et .
but i &apos;m not saying growth is wrong , but it &apos;s very stri@@ king that throughout the years of growth , many things didn &apos;t get better .
we &apos;ve done this for a very difficult case , which was for de@@ forest@@ ation in china .
so i &apos;ve been stuck . for the past 15 years i &apos;ve been trying to find a space suit that would do this job , or someone that will make one .
so did j@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r@@ . li@@ ck@@ li@@ der and his no@@ tions for computer@@ -@@ human interaction .
what to do next ? don &apos;t know .
but the point we want to make here tonight is , fa@@ velas are not always a problem .
we &apos;re going to start easy . some examples .
or the col@@ or@@ a@@ do river , which no longer flo@@ ws to the ocean .
and then we talk about organic food .
my challenge to the rest of the world is please , start using positive middle eastern images in your stories .
we can also use cy@@ ma@@ tics as a looking glass into nature .
my mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
&quot; cam@@ els are like angel@@ s , &quot; a bed@@ ou@@ in once said .

suppose that there are two diseases : one of them is rare , the other one is common , but if they are not treated they are equ@@ ally sever@@ e .
there is no reason why these portra@@ its should look ali@@ ke .
and one of the lessons we &apos;ve been learning is that the physi@@ ology of cells that we &apos;ve been studying for many years in qui@@ es@@ cent flies is not the same as the physi@@ ology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth .
i didn &apos;t know who i would be if i changed .
so i just want to welcome all of you onto the ri@@ de .
it basically em@@ be@@ ds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .

so your idea worth spre@@ ading is hi@@ re h@@ ack@@ ers .
but as i get older , i &apos;m also very nu@@ an@@ ced about what that word &quot; success &quot; might mean .
if she fail@@ s , we &apos;re all headed to the gal@@ lo@@ ws ; if she pass@@ es , we can leave to viet@@ na@@ m .
it makes perfect sense .
the most expensive thing is the battery inside this .
every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue re@@ generation or re@@ plac@@ ement .

eigh@@ ty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
and this just didn &apos;t work until we could cross this line that says high-@@ definition .
so instead , what we did was we decided to , instead of going out and doing what would result in what we &apos;d consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put j@@ on@@ as into d@@ har@@ a@@ vi , which is part of mumbai , india , and let him stay there , and really get into the heart and sou@@ l of this really major part of the city .
that was interesting .
okay . i am known as cap@@ tain organic , and that &apos;s a philosop@@ hi@@ cal position as well as an aes@@ thetic position .
and by the time we get around here , we get ten or fewer photos , and then there &apos;s this long , fl@@ at tail .
thir@@ te@@ en species -- high@@ est diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
they use the upper half of the face ; the e@@ ars are very expres@@ sive .
and i first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then i was using kno@@ ck@@ out mouse models -- mi@@ ce that couldn &apos;t make the gene .
ar@@ mand@@ o man@@ n@@ i is a former film@@ maker who makes this o@@ live oil from an o@@ live that gro@@ ws on a single slo@@ pe in t@@ us@@ c@@ any .
this was done under local anes@@ thes@@ ia , as an out@@ patient .
the comprehen@@ sive solution : this is the device ; it &apos;s about one in@@ ches by two in@@ ches and , o@@ dd@@ ly enough , just the thi@@ ck@@ ness of most cr@@ ani@@ al bones .
your work seems to suggest that that is power@@ fully wrong .
this is like , if you &apos;re familiar with any of the tele@@ pres@@ ence robots today -- this is mi@@ r@@ r@@ oring that situation .
most western intellec@@ tu@@ als look at this situation and say , &quot; well , there &apos;s nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for ted b@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ mit@@ s of a real argument that potenti@@ ally falls within the pur@@ view of science .
thank you .
and then this bub@@ bling , this mem@@ bran@@ e bub@@ bling , is the hall@@ mark of ap@@ op@@ t@@ osis in this cell .
it doesn &apos;t mean that if you are a republi@@ can that i &apos;m trying to convin@@ ce you to be a demo@@ cr@@ at . we need republi@@ c@@ ans as well . this used to be a bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an issue , and i know that in this group it really is . become poli@@ tically active .
we think we have solved the my@@ ster@@ y of creation .
you see the dark line on the side and the top . as you turn the pages of the book , the book can actually detect what page you &apos;re on , based on the cur@@ v@@ ature of the pages .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surro@@ und@@ ings .
&quot; what does it look like ? &quot;
you go on the back of that truck , it takes your photo , 30 seconds later take it from the side , you &apos;re ready to rock .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
that there in the des@@ ert was a field of sun@@ flowers growing seven feet t@@ all .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
see , uganda coming down , z@@ im@@ bab@@ we coming down , russia went to one percent .
if you look at these two , eye cont@@ act , fac@@ ing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
and that night , daniel tells us , at the hei@@ ght of the fe@@ sti@@ vi@@ ties a hand appeared and wrote on the wall , &quot; you are wei@@ gh@@ ed in the balance and found wan@@ ting , and your kingdom is hand@@ ed over to the medes and the per@@ si@@ ans . &quot;
so what follo@@ ws from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and poli@@ cing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money -- you &apos;re going to have a pretty mis@@ er@@ able time .
so , &quot; titanic &quot; was , if you don &apos;t know the story , doesn &apos;t end well .
i pulled out those ap@@ ples to re@@ mind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a newton and the apple type story , but it &apos;s a great story .
but more com@@ mon@@ ly all around the island , they were known as the sun@@ fish .
and so where there is water , there is a very high chance of our kind of life .
every time a new consumer jo@@ ins this media landscape a new produ@@ cer jo@@ ins as well , because the same equipment -- phones , computers -- let you consu@@ me and produce .
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of per@@ for@@ man@@ ce has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
it has also two ti@@ lt sensors that tell the machine which way it &apos;s til@@ ting .
patients are still on the operating room table .
so just don &apos;t leave it to the speci@@ alists and doctors and nur@@ ses .
an average african country recei@@ ves foreign aid to the tun@@ e of 13 , 15 percent of its g@@ dp , and that is an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .
there &apos;s something s@@ ac@@ red about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justi@@ fy to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save man@@ kind , or even that it &apos;s fe@@ asi@@ ble .
and there it ent@@ ered into the al@@ che@@ my community as ge@@ om@@ an@@ cy : di@@ vin@@ ation through the earth .
should have been done by state government or local government .
and these p@@ ills con@@ tain only low d@@ os@@ es of the active ingredi@@ ent .
fer@@ m@@ i &apos;s reason@@ ing , if i may par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase b@@ adly , is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason , there should be other intelli@@ gent life out there .
and every note , every be@@ at , every s@@ lu@@ r , every ac@@ cent , every pe@@ dal was perfect , because he played it for that room on that day .
they want change and justice , even at the risk of chaos .
so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shel@@ ter , pres@@ er@@ ved from noise pollution .
pat@@ enting a new drug helps fin@@ ance its im@@ men@@ se cost to develop -- but that same pat@@ ent can put advan@@ ced treatments out of reach for sick people in developing nations , at de@@ adly cost . ellen &apos; t ho@@ en talks about an elegant , working solution to the problem : the medi@@ cin@@ es pat@@ ent po@@ ol . &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
i like to think of this as the at@@ ar@@ i p@@ ong of this bl@@ ende@@ d-@@ reality play .
biolog@@ ist rob@@ ert full studies the amazing ge@@ ck@@ o , with its super@@ sti@@ cky feet and ten@@ ac@@ i@@ ous clim@@ bing sk@@ ill . but high-@@ speed footage reve@@ als that the ge@@ ck@@ o &apos;s tail har@@ bor@@ s perhaps the most surprising tal@@ ents of all .
it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
now , what if we want to look at this more clos@@ ely ?
but this does not mean everything happens .
the whole family came to se@@ ttle in france in the &apos; 3@@ 0s .
so i asked her one day , &quot; you know , when i was your age , i didn &apos;t make these .
you know , you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry , where you had these two atoms , they &apos;re close together , and the electr@@ ons are moving around . that tiny force is suffi@@ cient to allow them to do that because it &apos;s added up so many times with these small structures .
who am i being , that my children &apos;s eyes are not sh@@ ining ?
i do not recom@@ men@@ d this at all .
and up until a little more than a century ago , nobody was able to do that with the brain .
the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighbor@@ ho@@ ods -- this is a le@@ giti@@ mate form of urban development -- and that cities have to engage these resi@@ dents , because they are building the cities of the future .
i thought i would start with a very brief history of cities .
they say that people who are enga@@ ged in activities are happ@@ ier , easier for their care@@ gi@@ vers to look after , and it may even slow the progress of the disease .
this is the camera , and three instru@@ ments .
and what is the impact ?
over here , you see a pal@@ e@@ o@@ graphic ch@@ art that shows what has been deci@@ pher@@ ed so far , starting with the letter a , &quot; ā@@ le@@ p , &quot; at the top , and &quot; b@@ ê@@ t , &quot; in the middle , and so forth .
it turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive .
i have a sort of a collection of videos that i took of different instal@@ lations , which i could nar@@ rate .
those of you who have been to india have seen that .
and this person , mr. ubi@@ ra@@ jar@@ a .
han@@ na ros@@ in : and why is that ?
i call it my z.@@ e@@ .@@ n. clu@@ ster .
i &apos;d had dinner with her about two years ago and i &apos;d -- she had this big we@@ dding ring and i put it on my finger and i couldn &apos;t get it off .
now for an intelli@@ gent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal lear@@ ns from experience .
you can see that the lines cross when the population explo@@ des .
we &apos;re going down to the cell@@ ular level these days .
it &apos;s not better public transpor@@ tation .
in 193@@ 5 , there were 15@@ 0,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd@@ t and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
ben k@@ ac@@ yr@@ a : you can see here , these systems are extremely fast .
the other se@@ ctors , the in@@ for@@ mal and the traditional se@@ ctors , are where you find the majority of the african people , the real people in africa . that &apos;s where you find them .
because what we realize today is that modern culture appe@@ ars to have adop@@ ted a strategy of tragedy .
let &apos;s start with the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es . when you get demen@@ tia , it gets harder and harder to en@@ joy yourself .
they gave these mit students a bunch of games , games that involved creativity , and motor skills , and concent@@ ration .
and often , i &apos;m driving in a tax@@ i and i see a hole in a s@@ hir@@ t , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or func@@ tional in some way that i &apos;d never seen happen before .
and this allows something very special to happen in games .
the more we keep on using the oil , particularly the impor@@ ted oil , the more we face a very obvious ar@@ ray of problems .
you can do it immediately , right ?
so , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
but there &apos;s nothing you can do to comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te for the fact that we can pay $ 1.@@ 5@@ 7 an hour in ju@@ are@@ z , mexico . so we &apos;re leaving . &quot;
now i think at this point it &apos;s important for me to say that i actually love ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
t@@ d : but maybe in the spirit of app@@ reci@@ ating the kin@@ dness of you all , i could share with you a little story about myself .
and what did i discover ?
and i think , if you can imagine that kind of argument where the loser says to the w@@ inner and the audience and the jury can say , &quot; yeah , that was a good argument , &quot; then you have imag@@ ined a good argument .
and some governments told me that it &apos;s fascinating that the yo@@ unger generation actually thinks about these things .
well , they were just there for 5@@ 3 hours , and i was there for years .
he said this , he said , &quot; nothing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progress of the human mind than to pres@@ u@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ultimate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , that there are no my@@ steri@@ es in nature , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
they have to dri@@ ll holes in the ice , di@@ ve down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any re@@ pa@@ irs and ma@@ inten@@ ance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice mel@@ ts .
in the second world war , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
i &apos;m able to see the con@@ tradi@@ ction that you may not be able to see .
the question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very mu@@ d@@ died , because we now know , from mars me@@ te@@ or@@ ites that have made it to earth , that there &apos;s material that can be ex@@ changed between those two planets .
and in this way , these women en@@ ac@@ ted a lot of transformation , beautiful transformation .
who lo@@ ves the we@@ dding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
hans rosling was a young gu@@ est student in india when he first realized that asia had all the capac@@ i@@ ties to rec@@ la@@ im its place as the world &apos;s dominant economic force . at te@@ din@@ dia , he graph@@ s global economic growth since 18@@ 5@@ 8 and predi@@ cts the ex@@ act date that india and china will out@@ stri@@ p the us .
so this is just a picture -- a micro@@ graph of your skin .
i just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular .
and we heard a little bit about func@@ tional mri .
thank you .
those are the kind of po@@ sters , let me show you .
the one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
and the third level is refle@@ ctive , which is , if you like the super@@ e@@ go , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the sen@@ ses , doesn &apos;t control the mus@@ cles .
this is the military the rest of the world wants us to build .
will these revolu@@ tions be whole like through the transi@@ tions to democracy or be over@@ taken by military or extre@@ mi@@ sts of all kinds ? we cannot tell .
and here is a picture of the k@@ h@@ mer rou@@ ge .
now you and i could argu@@ e that they probably did not need to touch her brea@@ sts .
and the answer is no .
this blin@@ ds or di@@ stra@@ cts the predat@@ or .
what about bei@@ j@@ ing ?
it os@@ c@@ ill@@ ates its tail up and down like a dol@@ phin .
and i started to make him walk across the table , and i thought , &quot; oh , i can make a little machine that will do that . &quot;
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and an@@ xiety are redu@@ ced .
now if we look at animals , though , to be really man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able in all sur@@ faces , the animals use hy@@ bri@@ d mechanisms that inclu@@ de cla@@ ws , and sp@@ ines , and ha@@ irs , and pa@@ ds , and gl@@ ue , and cap@@ ill@@ ary ad@@ h@@ esi@@ on and a whole bunch of other things .
the random charac@@ ters that happened to be shown to the user were w , a , i , t , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word .
you notice that you &apos;re getting old , and you look at your human and you think , &quot; why isn &apos;t this human getting old ? &quot;
i don &apos;t think we would see an all-@@ out nuclear war any time soon , although even that is not completely off the table .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environ@@ ment@@ alists and food people , maybe we just need to di@@ tch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
well , we on c@@ ass@@ in@@ i have taken an equivalent first , a picture that no human eye has ever seen before .
we call this a co-@@ vie@@ wing cli@@ que , a virtual living room if you will .
and we go back to 19@@ 20 , and i want to look at japan .
the best example of quality of life is the tur@@ tle because the tur@@ tle is an example of living and working together .
i used to say that when a game is over , and you see somebody that didn &apos;t know the out@@ come , i hope they couldn &apos;t tell by your actions whether you ou@@ ts@@ cor@@ ed an op@@ pon@@ ent or the op@@ pon@@ ent ou@@ ts@@ cor@@ ed you .
a bit more se@@ arch@@ ing through the profile and there &apos;s a photo of their office .
equ@@ ally unti@@ dy office there , as you can see .
a very powerful message ap@@ pa@@ ch@@ an : i watch the world wake up every day .
on the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific con@@ sen@@ sus about this pattern now .
come , have a seat in my home enter@@ tainment center .
the kinds of colli@@ sions of st@@ y@@ les and things were quite something , and these are called the vi@@ ll@@ as .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
i was as sm@@ el@@ ly and as depres@@ sed as anyone in line .
music transc@@ ends the aes@@ thetic beauty alone .
the pu@@ ri@@ t@@ ans came here for religious reasons , or so they said , but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ gradu@@ ate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the high@@ est grade you can get in swe@@ dis@@ h college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
but what happens for your li@@ gam@@ ent when i need an int@@ act li@@ gam@@ ent ?
let me just try to draw some con@@ clu@@ sions from what has happened .
and i was very touched by de@@ an kamen &apos;s work for the military , or for the soldiers , because charles and ray designed a mol@@ ded pl@@ ywood sp@@ lin@@ t . this is it .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t s@@ hr@@ in@@ k them and keep the v@@ acu@@ um .
because technology is an ex@@ ten@@ sion of life , it &apos;s in parallel and al@@ ig@@ ned with the same things that life wants .
hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly , i began to re@@ treat into this ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ ish inner world in which the voices were dest@@ ined to become both my per@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and my only percei@@ ved compani@@ ons .
but let me explain what i &apos;m thinking .
so following the a@@ gi@@ le model , we ask three questions : what worked well in our family this week , what didn &apos;t work well , and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead ?
and it would remain st@@ able and oper@@ ate quite happ@@ ily .
pul@@ ling water out of mon@@ terey fo@@ g and out of the swe@@ at@@ y air in atlan@@ ta , before it gets into a building , are key technologies .
&quot; it &apos;s a glam@@ or@@ ous sha@@ de of pin@@ k . &quot;
along the y-@@ axis , the ver@@ tical axis , is how t@@ all they actually were .
and during that learning cur@@ ve the compli@@ cations went quite a bit higher .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
and hope actually is at the heart of this .
you &apos;ll get a new syn@@ thesis .
we &apos;re only just beginning to understand how the physical oce@@ an@@ o@@ graphy and the biological oce@@ an@@ o@@ graphy come together to create a seas@@ onal force that actually causes the up@@ w@@ elling that might make a hot spot a hope spot .
i found out that &apos;s very true , working on this campaign worldwide .
we &apos;ve got to qu@@ it bor@@ ro@@ wing as much , because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole p@@ ie .
and then , that this discussion was dra@@ wing geo@@ graphi@@ cal boun@@ dar@@ ies around me .
we &apos;re defin@@ ed by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ec@@ ology .
over the next 40 years , buildings , which use three-@@ quar@@ ters of the electricity , can tri@@ ple or quad@@ ru@@ ple their energy productivity , saving 1.@@ 4 trillion dollars , net present value , with a 3@@ 3 percent internal rate of return or in english , the sa@@ vings are worth four times what they cost .
is this what we want , you know ?
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot;
i want that because that means that they &apos;re cool@@ er than i am , and i need that .
mi@@ hal@@ y c@@ si@@ ks@@ zent@@ mi@@ hal@@ y@@ i : flow , the secret to happiness
i think it &apos;s a hop@@ eless goal . technologi@@ cally , it &apos;s achie@@ vable ; econom@@ ically , it &apos;s achie@@ vable ; poli@@ tically , it means sort of the hab@@ its , institutions of people -- it &apos;s impossible .
and actually , it &apos;s really been pion@@ e@@ ered by al@@ ex@@ a internet , which don@@ ates this collection to the internet archi@@ ve .
brian co@@ x : why we need the explor@@ ers
it &apos;s in@@ sane . and they have these systems where you can le@@ vel@@ -up .
kb : almost , oh . ok , you &apos;re making sure that &apos;s well hidden . now -- oh , we &apos;ve got one here , we &apos;ve got one here .
r@@ on mc@@ call@@ um : isn &apos;t that slow ?
this is an investi@@ ga@@ tional technology , but , in clin@@ ical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in chron@@ ic pain patients .
psychologists have known this for decades , and it &apos;s time for poli@@ cy@@ ma@@ kers to start pa@@ ying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit , instead of econom@@ i@@ sts .
well , in africa , we have the equivalent of seven jum@@ bo 7@@ 4@@ 7@@ s crash@@ ing every day .
so the idea is : how to inte@@ gra@@ te these flo@@ ws in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
so here &apos;s what you do . first of all , as i said , don &apos;t st@@ are at the light fl@@ ash , if you can . i don &apos;t know you could possibly res@@ ist doing that .
intervie@@ wer : so just show me how you walk norm@@ ally . right .
a flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking , clim@@ bing or swimming animal .
so we came up with this proto@@ cell model here that i &apos;m showing .
and the man said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he showed him a dis@@ h full of nee@@ d@@ les .
so that &apos;s open-@@ source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
that &apos;s what he pra@@ ys .
in fact , chemistry &apos;s extremely rich , and our body uses a lot of them .
this is not something i &apos;ve made up .
you have a fantastic e@@ ar . everybody has a fantastic e@@ ar .
and there &apos;s this re@@ ference to &quot; le pe@@ ti@@ t prin@@ ce &quot; where the nar@@ r@@ ator as@@ ks the prin@@ ce to draw a she@@ ep .
so he &apos;s call@@ ing oxytocin &quot; the moral molecule . &quot;
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot;
i think that perhaps the emergen@@ ce of the first cells was as prob@@ able as the emergen@@ ce of the stars .
so this was a de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging , problem@@ -@@ solving sc@@ en@@ ario from the beginning because there was no recip@@ e of how to get there .
she was pres@@ er@@ ved by mo@@ dest@@ y of the religion she was ad@@ or@@ ned by the light of the qu@@ ran s@@ her@@ e@@ en el fe@@ k@@ i : 4@@ sh@@ ba@@ b has been du@@ b@@ bed islam@@ ic m@@ tv .
this base has a lot of fl@@ aps in it .
of course , her com@@ e@@ back is , &quot; when have i embar@@ rass@@ ed you ? &quot;
it &apos;s implan@@ ted with very conven@@ tional techniques .
because back then , video camer@@ as were just starting to become popular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . and since this came in on a fri@@ day , they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virg@@ ina , mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sylvania and new jer@@ sey until it did that to a car in new york .
and at the heart of that economics , we &apos;re plac@@ ing a more cre@@ di@@ ble , more robust , and more reali@@ stic vision of what it means to be human .
no , we decided to do a bit more .
before that i feel like i wasn &apos;t like this .
there &apos;s a little le@@ dge inside , so the te@@ a is sitting there and the water is fil@@ ling it up like that .
and this was very consi@@ stent .
the years -- and until i stopped looking at the poll@@ s , you were sort of regar@@ ded as this great her@@ o in the u.k. and elsewhere .
we pay for it on ap@@ ri@@ l 15@@ th , and we can &apos;t even calcu@@ late the cost of this invol@@ vement .
now , some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology , or a degree in chemistry , you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry .
the third thing is again cities .
and so what if you could design and build electronics like this ? so what if you could do it extremely quickly , extremely in@@ expen@@ si@@ vely , and maybe more interestingly , really flu@@ i@@ dly and expres@@ si@@ vely and even impro@@ vis@@ a@@ tion@@ ally ?
i kid you not .
and you put a little fan here .
interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the minister of fin@@ ance who se@@ es it as an engine of economic growth .
in fact , i &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
female voice : long range laser scanning by sen@@ ding out a pul@@ se that &apos;s a laser be@@ am of light .
and here it &apos;s a much ni@@ cer bedro@@ om , you can see .
it &apos;s actually better to drive for about maybe 1@@ 60 , 1@@ 70 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going .
today , we have got 60 conser@@ van@@ cies that manage and protect over 13 million he@@ c@@ tar@@ es of land in nam@@ i@@ bia .
and that &apos;s what will happen to us .
jam@@ ie , here &apos;s the puzzle to me .
i led three di@@ ving expe@@ di@@ tions to antar@@ c@@ tica .
it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hot@@ els .
it &apos;s one of the most successful games of all time .
le@@ tters actually work .
thank you very much .
but they did what they could to stabili@@ ze the people .
imagine a restaurant that ser@@ ves mich@@ el@@ in-@@ star@@ red food , but actually where the restaurant sm@@ ells of se@@ wage and there &apos;s human fe@@ ces on the floor .
and then i asked the usual question : &quot; is it a pri@@ ority ?
and the object is the passi@@ ve no@@ -@@ voice .
we ho@@ i@@ sted them on pol@@ es to photograph .
so here is a little question for you .
water is energy inten@@ sive .
we do need to really start trying .
so , that would be my wish to the future .
dam@@ bis@@ a mo@@ yo : is china the new i@@ do@@ l for emer@@ ging econom@@ ies ?
the o@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans have this an@@ c@@ est@@ or v@@ ener@@ ation .
and the li@@ m@@ ous@@ ine emp@@ ties out .
i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said , &quot; i &apos;m qu@@ it@@ ting . &quot;
but abed did not slow , and on that x@@ er@@ ox@@ ed piece of paper , my ne@@ ck again broke , and again , i was left without an@@ ger .
ed ul@@ br@@ ich , the digit@@ al-@@ effects g@@ ur@@ u from digital dom@@ ain , explains the os@@ car@@ -@@ winning technology that allowed his team to digit@@ ally create the older versions of bra@@ d pit@@ t &apos;s face for &quot; the curious case of benjam@@ in button . &quot;
have you seen the new work they &apos;ve done to the wal@@ tz to@@ wers ?
so my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an object , when he looks at his -- any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s process@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ rus , and you recognize it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , ok ?
shu@@ kr@@ an !
i want to say a few words about vision .
so , magnificent cre@@ ature , isn &apos;t it ?
who is going to pay for it ? &quot;
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
we &apos;re coming down , and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here , in the financial distri@@ ct .
so does all this matter ? or is global@@ on@@ ey just a harm@@ less way of getting people to pay more attention to glob@@ ali@@ za@@ tion-@@ related issues ?
and the other is becoming par@@ ap@@ le@@ gic .
we sell them , we kill them as em@@ br@@ yo@@ s , we ens@@ la@@ ve them , we r@@ ape them .
we &apos;d better give you a real sound bi@@ te .
because , you know , it &apos;s great for us , but bad for humans .
so we paid attention to a particular gram@@ ma@@ tical rule , pa@@ st-@@ ten@@ se con@@ ju@@ gation .
now , what if my room@@ mate knew about my friend f@@ um@@ i on@@ da , a fe@@ ar@@ less woman who ho@@ sts a tv show in la@@ gos , and is deter@@ min@@ ed to tell the stories that we pre@@ fer to forget ?
but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 18@@ 50 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
yet each pal@@ es to in@@ significance with the comple@@ tion of that magnificent ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment of tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ fir@@ st-@@ century technology , the digital super@@ highway .
in fact , talk about technology imit@@ ating life imit@@ ating tech , or maybe it &apos;s the other way around .
this is a report about a drug called li@@ thi@@ um .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 100@@ ,@@ 000-@@ base pa@@ ir pieces we synthesi@@ zed were completely accurate and com@@ pati@@ ble with a life@@ -@@ forming sequence .
it &apos;s going to dep@@ end whether they &apos;re inn@@ er-@@ city or r@@ ural .
the results were quite extraordinary .
and i don &apos;t know anymore where to put them .
that is , pro@@ mote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed .
and there &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o behind , which has glac@@ i@@ ers at the very top .
because finally human beings are getting it .
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of har@@ mon@@ y .
it really involves many different areas .
para@@ g k@@ han@@ na : m@@ apping the future of countries
adam o@@ ck@@ el@@ ford : i promise there won &apos;t be too much of me talking , and a lot of derek playing , but i thought it would just be nice to re@@ cap on how derek got to where he is today .
du@@ h ! 66 percent of the students , two-@@ thirds , pre@@ fer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind .
let &apos;s first look at the relationship of ultra@@ vio@@ let radi@@ ation to the earth &apos;s surface .
and that made a huge impact on me when i was doing this research .
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
these are all basically port@@ als into that one machine .
doctor : what shape do you see here ?
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only phil@@ anthrop@@ y that &apos;s re@@ organi@@ zing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social sector , and of business , that are bus@@ y challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
american pris@@ ons and ja@@ ils are filled with people who suff@@ er from sever@@ e mental illness , and many of them are there because they never received ade@@ qu@@ ate treatment .
thank you .
one of the most famous of these guys , fr@@ ere j@@ ac@@ ques , shown here doing a li@@ th@@ ot@@ om@@ y -- which is the re@@ mov@@ al of the bla@@ d@@ der stone , one of the most inv@@ asi@@ ve sur@@ ger@@ ies they did at the time -- had to take less than two minutes .
it feels the dna orig@@ ami .
and i think this country ought to continue its great debate , wh@@ ining and complaining , &quot; i &apos;m enti@@ t@@ led . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a victi@@ m . &quot;
so we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of al@@ ex@@ and@@ ri@@ a .
i think i can sa@@ f@@ ely say that i &apos;m the only trilli@@ on@@ a@@ ire in this room .
and then she was nervous .
if you wanted to read in 18@@ 75 at night , you needed to have an oil or a gas lam@@ p .
this is the school bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o .
so , in ten@@ nis , every point is either good for you and bad for the other person , or good for them , bad for you .
but it stri@@ kes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest dis@@ ast@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ enced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affec@@ ting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
not only would it li@@ ft , but it might never return .
so , again , we sort of co-@@ op@@ t our environment to do all these different things .
now i told you -- i love the internet . i do .
the next element is the fact that i have applied a value judg@@ ment and my value judg@@ ment is that the pres@@ ence of life is better than no life .
and basically to ask the questions : what if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
we &apos;re either going to have an absolutely un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated cat@@ astrop@@ he of this oil lea@@ k in the gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have not@@ ed today .
and pretty early on , those storms started making their pres@@ ence known .
64 becomes 6@@ ,@@ 400 .
but it was too late .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; you know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the chinese character on them . &quot;
and i believe in both of them .
that was enough . it really got the city behind it .
this is part of that genome .
the pollen has little bar@@ bs on it , if we look .
but kit@@ es aren &apos;t just toys like this .
we just never knew how to get there , what we were doing .
and we certainly don &apos;t have any em@@ pathy for that part -- which explains the third consi@@ stent comp@@ on@@ ent of regre@@ t , which is an inten@@ se des@@ ire to pun@@ ish ourselves .
it &apos;s an honor to have you at ted .
and it has really good response time .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
we need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
&quot; i love you more than — &quot; all right ! she left the room hal@@ f@@ way through his en@@ um@@ er@@ ation of his love for her .
it is , as steven john@@ son has talked about , an emer@@ gent phenomenon .
r@@ m : thanks .
so , i can go ahead and look that thing up .
the first one that we see occur@@ s in the an@@ cient rain@@ forests of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geo@@ graphic society is helping us to explore these fossi@@ l de@@ pos@@ its . this is ri@@ vers@@ lei@@ gh .
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus re@@ x looks like in my living room .
and you &apos;re working away until late at night , and you &apos;re very , very care@@ ful , and you &apos;re drin@@ king coffee and you &apos;re pa@@ ying attention , but , oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on@@ ally , when you &apos;re cop@@ ying this by hand , you &apos;re going to make a little typ@@ o , a sp@@ elling mista@@ ke -- sub@@ stit@@ ute an i for an e , or a c for a t .
but birds are dinosau@@ r@@ s .
the first is vulner@@ ability is not we@@ ak@@ ness .
with this whole sort of su@@ ite of poli@@ cies , we could actually reduce our gas@@ ol@@ ine consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020 .
we live in a digital world , but we &apos;re fairly analo@@ g creatures .
this is a seas@@ on of gra@@ ce .
then , having done that , we started to image the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt .
for these kids , it was a military tool to de@@ f@@ end un@@ ar@@ med people from mur@@ der@@ ers .
you sort of -- now you say , well , let &apos;s see if i can get hold of some pot@@ assi@@ um chlor@@ ate and su@@ gar , per@@ chlor@@ ate and su@@ gar , and heat it ; it would be interesting to see what it is they don &apos;t want me to do , and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work .
and not one country in all the world has el@@ im@@ in@@ ated its economic parti@@ cip@@ ation gap -- not one .
bon@@ nie , where are you ?
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de in this soli@@ d graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a sub@@ set of the elements in the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
i have learned from wikipedia that , starting with that hum@@ ble beginning , pla@@ to establi@@ shed for@@ ums , message bo@@ ar@@ ds , online te@@ sting , email , ch@@ at rooms , picture languages , inst@@ ant messa@@ ging , remote screen sharing and multi@@ ple@@ -@@ player games .
or you could go into three-@@ dimensional art .
for 20 seconds he &apos;s going like that , and all of a sudden it lights up up here .
and they sat on it for months actually .
so let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
this third best one was free trade .
we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price in@@ centi@@ ves , but also invest@@ ing in the right infrastructure and the appro@@ pri@@ ate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to un@@ le@@ ash the power of innovation in the market .
so we worked with a company that speci@@ ali@@ zes in camera sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the back@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them invisible .
it &apos;s almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry .
at 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these eff@@ or@@ ts .
you feel kind of sle@@ ep@@ y afterwards .
this is the math under@@ lying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
i took this picture in the ti@@ ha@@ ma@@ h des@@ ert while 25 milli@@ meters -- that &apos;s an inch of rain -- was falling .
this is one of the best agr@@ on@@ om@@ i@@ sts in mala@@ w@@ i , jun@@ at@@ am@@ be k@@ um@@ bir@@ a , and he &apos;s disc@@ us@@ sing what sort of cas@@ sa@@ va they will plant -- the best conver@@ ter of s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine to food that man has found .
i had a bu@@ tter@@ fly period , a s@@ na@@ ke period , a bird period , a fish period , a ca@@ ve period and finally and defini@@ tively , an ant period .
it &apos;s not having experiences that make us wise , it &apos;s refle@@ cting on the experiences that we &apos;ve had that makes us wise -- and that helps us become whole , brings wisdom and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity .
who prof@@ its ? does anything justi@@ fy what the local community goes through ?
they &apos;re essentially digital camer@@ as .
but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ eless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
no@@ or is arab@@ ic for light .
i &apos;m working in a team with air@@ bus , and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of avi@@ ation .
it uses x-@@ ra@@ ys , x-@@ ray be@@ ams , that are ro@@ tat@@ ing very fast around the human body .
it &apos;s the home of my ment@@ or .
so i &apos;m a woman with chron@@ ic schizophren@@ ia .
so we should embra@@ ce our difference and a@@ im for challenge .
he had a good lau@@ gh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board .
i &apos;m a belie@@ ver in global warming , and my record is good on the subject .
that &apos;s m@@ apped against the red do@@ t , un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , which is a simple bu@@ re@@ au of labor department stati@@ stic .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
so what is it about a movement which is good or bad ?
i worked out recently that i was given a guit@@ ar as a kid at about the same time that eric cl@@ ap@@ ton got his first guit@@ ar .
now they have started writing their sig@@ nature .
it &apos;s a human and technological revolution .
for inst@@ ance , this is another student of mine , susan j@@ ack@@ son from australia , who did work with some of the le@@ ading ath@@ le@@ tes in the world .
here are some ways that we can make some drama@@ tic changes .
it &apos;s on altru@@ ism and chimpanze@@ es where the question is , do chimpanze@@ es care about the wel@@ f@@ are of somebody else ?
now , below that board of direc@@ tors , you &apos;ve got essentially what are regi@@ onal v@@ ps -- people who control , say , the south side of chicago , or the west side of chicago .
and he made sure this whole story was written down in re@@ formed eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an hier@@ o@@ gl@@ yp@@ hi@@ cs ch@@ is@@ eled onto gold pl@@ ates , which he then bu@@ ried near pal@@ my@@ ra , new york .
this was right about the time that i was off@@ ered a position here at ber@@ kel@@ ey , and when i got here , i looked up hu@@ bert dre@@ y@@ f@@ us , who &apos;s a world-@@ ren@@ ow@@ ned professor of philosoph@@ y , and i talked with him about this , and he said , &quot; this is one of the ol@@ dest and most central problems in philosoph@@ y . it goes back to the skep@@ tics , and up through des@@ car@@ tes .
thank you very much . thank you . thank you .
so what we have , increas@@ ingly , is cell phones just per@@ me@@ ating out through society .
and they expected that it would be young families , or young men , just like it had always been .
but too late .
i have a church full of ce@@ os and scientists .
so this is basically multi@@ ple@@ x@@ ing in time .
they also have a 3@@ ,@@ 000-@@ year-old a@@ da@@ ge , which i think is the greatest sort of di@@ et sugge@@ sti@@ on ever invented .
they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
we won &apos;t make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around .
i said , &quot; look , you &apos;re nu@@ ts . that technology &apos;s just not available right now .
so why build robots like this ?
the fact that it &apos;s a child &apos;s to@@ y that we all recognize , but also it looks like it &apos;s a robot , and it comes from a sci@@ -@@ fi gen@@ us .
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
this animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space .
now , who knows if vi@@ ctor is going to grow up and become a program@@ mer or a professional computer scientist ?
you &apos;re pe@@ e@@ king .
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before i &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?
so it &apos;s just -- thanks .
i worry about her every time she tra@@ vels across that country .
this is the reti@@ re@@ e health care benefits .
comp@@ are these to the actual numbers .
and finally i made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .
the government cu@@ tting them off from all the prin@@ ting fac@@ ili@@ ties in bra@@ tis@@ la@@ va .
and here you can see these woo@@ den effi@@ gi@@ es of the ancestors , so these are people who have already been bu@@ ried , already had a fun@@ er@@ al cer@@ em@@ ony .
there &apos;s no man@@ ual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t inter@@ ac@@ ted with a computer before .
dh : then here we go .
this was a very large mall on a hund@@ re@@ d-@@ acre super@@ block .
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
let me just say , look , my job is a privi@@ lege because we &apos;re in a special time .
it &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
you think that that might be healthy food , but in fact , if you look at the ingredi@@ ent list , it &apos;s closer in form to a s@@ ni@@ ck@@ ers than it is to o@@ at@@ me@@ al .
we couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
you will say &quot; kam@@ bar , &quot; then you will have to go , &quot; maker , &quot; and all that , and then you can un@@ stick yourself .
because this is what i do . this is what i teach .
so the conversation began at ben@@ n@@ ing@@ ton .
jos@@ ep@@ h b@@ ell was an extraordinary teacher by all accoun@@ ts .
i love it .
i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re going to take care of her . &quot;
develop@@ ment@@ ally , these two conditions develop in exactly the same way . between late childhood and mid-@@ adol@@ escence , there &apos;s an impro@@ vement , in other words a redu@@ ction of err@@ ors , in both of these trials , in both of these conditions .
we cut them lo@@ ose and made several bri@@ d@@ ges and created a kind of a fore@@ ground for this hotel .
&quot; i have read &apos; blackaw@@ ton be@@ es &apos; recently . i don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now .
yeah . so , good .
and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pil@@ ot project and the jury is still out .
to a first appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tion , the problem of man@@ aging a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay .
the first , to prevent mo@@ ther@@ -@@ to-@@ child trans@@ mission .
and by the look of that pa@@ un@@ ch , he hasn &apos;t been doing enough yo@@ g@@ a .
we create financial markets that are super complex .
has@@ an , thank you very much .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth &apos;s or@@ bit , and our earth will be kap@@ ut , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fu@@ el@@ ing space ex@@ pan@@ sion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your to@@ es , because everything around you exp@@ ands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
woman # 2 : i &apos;m a little bit conf@@ used . woman # 3 : they look like the squ@@ ar@@ es to me .
because it is true that there was a decl@@ ine in pre@@ val@@ ence in uganda in the 199@@ 0s . it &apos;s true that they had an education campaign .
and of course , we had beautiful spac@@ es@@ hip@@ one , which made those two fli@@ ghts and won the competi@@ tion .
the web links everything , and very soon it will medi@@ ate most human activity .
so here are pictures of myself .
it was somebody sitting somewhere mani@@ pul@@ ating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diam@@ ond , the gold and the land .
so from data like this , we &apos;re able now to put the map up , and in this map you see thousands of posi@@ tions gener@@ ated by this decade and a half of tag@@ ging .
so it &apos;s not his daughter , but it &apos;s somebody close to him , physi@@ cally close to him .
tech enthusi@@ ast k@@ ev@@ in kel@@ ly as@@ ks &quot; what does technology want ? &quot; and discover@@ s that its movement toward ubi@@ qu@@ ity and complexity is much like the evolution of life .
but if you look in a cat@@ alog -- particularly a cat@@ alog of modern , beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this .
and then he r@@ uns to the ne@@ ar@@ est tree and starts to break bran@@ ches and th@@ row rocks and cur@@ se like i &apos;ve never heard .
what can you do ? you can person@@ ally get carbon neu@@ tral .
ok , everybody imagine books and imagine just te@@ aring out the pages .
thank you very much .
se@@ an g@@ our@@ ley : the mathematics of war
and i am than@@ k@@ ful .
and eventually we may be able to understand if they &apos;re not just cor@@ rela@@ tive differences , but cau@@ sa@@ tive .
you know , the to@@ es of the ge@@ ck@@ o , cur@@ ling and un@@ cur@@ ling like the fing@@ ers of michael mos@@ chen .
the real hom@@ eless don &apos;t have hope . &quot;
rio has the a@@ im , by 2020 , to have all its fa@@ velas completely ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed .
audience : yes .
because if you improve those things , then people are going to have an in@@ cen@@ tive to avo@@ id aids on their own .
you couldn &apos;t tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from ro@@ me .
we found one s@@ ample to be able to get into culture .
and they went sur@@ fing .
so here we have -- let &apos;s turn this around -- a diam@@ ond .
and so i went home , and i made a pro@@ totyp@@ e of this hat .
always , all the data shows it &apos;s the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved indepen@@ d@@ ently .
and , in other words , it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldi@@ er that was responsible , not greater ke@@ en@@ ness of eye or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand .
they want to bor@@ row the cy@@ rus cy@@ linder .
and a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dre@@ ams .
people are rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ant to talk about it -- there &apos;s a fear associ@@ ated with it .
compar@@ ing with the past causes many of the problems that behavi@@ oral econom@@ i@@ sts and psychologists identi@@ fy in people &apos;s attemp@@ ts to assig@@ n value .
this is not fi@@ ction , nothing at all .
so , this represents -- this is a cros@@ s-@@ s@@ ample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world &apos;s greatest photo@@ journ@@ alists , working at the very top of their craft -- except one .
you know , i can &apos;t promise my child a life without bi@@ as -- we &apos;re all bi@@ as@@ ed -- but i promise to bi@@ as my child with multiple perspe@@ cti@@ ves .
and it &apos;s not limited to just people or dat@@ es , but we can actually put in conc@@ ep@@ ts also .
and it &apos;s a power park .
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor , you send out somebody who can just take the s@@ ample , and in the clin@@ ic either a doctor , or ide@@ ally a computer in this case , does the analysis .
it &apos;s been a roll@@ er co@@ aster ri@@ de .
so let me now apply this to a current contro@@ vers@@ y , not because i want to ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate any particular solution , but just to illu@@ strate the kind of thing i mean .
and as you can imagine , it is a lo@@ vely and very ener@@ ge@@ tic time .
and , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves .
so if gol@@ fing is the kind of game that can be played while ri@@ ding around in a golf c@@ art , it would be hard to con@@ fer on the gol@@ fing gre@@ ats the status that we con@@ fer , the honor and recogni@@ tion that goes to truly great ath@@ le@@ tes .
but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argu@@ e as hard as they can for what they believe .
it &apos;s natural .
i think it was a poor trans@@ lation , probably , but people reli@@ ed on auth@@ orities like that .
first , she talked about com@@ fort , status , beauty .
the war has tremendous ris@@ ks for the model that i &apos;m descri@@ bing because it &apos;s very possible that as a con@@ sequence of a war , many musli@@ ms will con@@ clu@@ de that the united states is not the kind of place that they want to e@@ mu@@ late with respect to its forms of political government .
this is an example of a spec@@ tro@@ gram .
che@@ e@@ to paint is a very simple way to paint with che@@ e@@ to@@ s .
that &apos;s still true today .
but he should , because the problem with all that po@@ op lying around is that po@@ op car@@ ri@@ es passen@@ gers .
my name is ka@@ il@@ ash . and i like to en@@ rich lives through techni@@ col@@ ored glass .
but then i &apos;m going to slowly turn down the heat , so to speak , and then there &apos;s this vi@@ ability threshold where now it would be possible for a repli@@ cat@@ or to actually live .
this is deeply democra@@ ti@@ zing .
it &apos;s a great tool of communication for bad or for good .
and all of that stuff is really dis@@ gu@@ sting , but what &apos;s really insi@@ di@@ ous is the biological pollution that happens because of the magni@@ tu@@ de of the shif@@ ts that it causes to entire ec@@ osystems .
increas@@ ingly , i would say explosi@@ ve growth of technology .
but , instead of de@@ v@@ our@@ ing the people in the sho@@ p , and smo@@ ther@@ ing virtu@@ ally all of the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ d@@ w@@ elling life of the entire north@@ western medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an sea .
the thing we &apos;re missing is the 10 cents .
why is this ?
so it &apos;s a br@@ ut@@ al winter in the nor@@ the@@ ast , your kid has as@@ th@@ ma , your heat just got turned off , and of course you &apos;re in the waiting room of the er , because the cold air tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed your child &apos;s as@@ th@@ ma .
this is the context . this is where we are now in israel .
see , we used to have a lot of ap@@ ples .
and the cam@@ els come down again like el@@ ev@@ ators , we sort of cl@@ um@@ si@@ ly get off , and they -- obviously -- try to take another ch@@ un@@ k out of my leg .
so , response planning in the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ first century is both possible and is essential .
it was just going 65 -- to zero ?
this is a picture of it .
the sub-@@ surface of earth con@@ tains a vast bio@@ diversity .
however , what can wo@@ und us and our reaction to those wo@@ unds -- they are universal .
go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
and it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean har@@ mon@@ y and peace and quie@@ t , but it does mean huge invol@@ vement in everybody else &apos;s aff@@ air@@ s .
we have the anim@@ alo@@ id -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , inse@@ c@@ to@@ id , so on .
and that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9 / 11 to show what was going on in afghanistan .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
it really allows anybody to kind of go in -- and , it just does what you &apos;d expect , you know ? again , there &apos;s just no interface here . the interface just dis@@ appe@@ ars .
you ho@@ ok these up -- in this case , to the virtual mus@@ cles of that two-@@ leg@@ ged cre@@ ature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
there is an enter@@ tainment software industry which is extremely de@@ ft at coming up with appe@@ aling products that you can &apos;t res@@ ist .
as you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
so we had the goals , and each one of these goals -- and i won &apos;t go through them all — puts at the center the person and their health issue , and it then conne@@ cts them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good .
but what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in indian enter@@ tainment .
this is a material you all know is st@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , but i like to think of it as tox@@ ic white stuff .
i &apos;m not a scientist . i could have been , perhaps , but i work in this world where i trust my inst@@ in@@ cts .
and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings , i was shocked to see that they &apos;re not using a central air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning system ; every window has an air condi@@ tion@@ er in it .
the better we understand these ill@@ n@@ esses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
so there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of universal .
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai .
the train has left the station . the cat is out of the ba@@ g .
paul cla@@ y@@ ton : it ain &apos;t no use to sit and si@@ gh now , dar@@ l@@ in &apos; , and it ain &apos;t no use to sit and c@@ ry now . b@@ d : it ain &apos;t no use to sit and wonder why , bab@@ e , if you don &apos;t know by now , and it ain &apos;t no use to sit and wonder why , bab@@ e , it &apos;ll never do somehow . okay , now , there &apos;s a lot of these .
this is just a road . and it &apos;s not very big : it &apos;s about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
j yeah . two re@@ u@@ ters employees , two young children were wo@@ unded .
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of shor@@ t-@@ term work@@ force to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare lea@@ der@@ ship pi@@ pel@@ ine who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clin@@ ic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
and now its biggest threat is the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance of ice in the north because of the lives that we &apos;re le@@ ading in the south .
i was a media jun@@ kie , and eventually got involved with ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
so 500 people applied , and four were selec@@ ted to actually go and tour the fac@@ ili@@ ty in question , and th@@ us in@@ spe@@ ct it and then blog about it .
it &apos;s a type of fossi@@ li@@ zed dent@@ al pla@@ que that is called offi@@ cially dent@@ al calcul@@ us .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , the creation of life .
did you know that we americ@@ ans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
the after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that &apos;s just the general blood work .
thank you .
if you want to bel@@ ong , you need social play .
here &apos;s our living room , the baby bedro@@ om , kitchen , din@@ ing room and the rest of the house .
this is a fact -- or , as we say in my home@@ town of washington , d@@ .c. , a true fact .
so i read slowly .
we stood on the ra@@ il@@ road tra@@ cks that ran between my friend &apos;s house and the beach .
all that being good and no real cre@@ dit for it .
ok . what &apos;s that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things .
it creates a very high pe@@ ak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find he@@ mo@@ zo@@ in .
now that is -- my take on that ...
so , act ii : a home re@@ constru@@ cted .
so what did we find ?
here is what i did with figure and ground .
mik@@ ko hy@@ pp@@ onen : how the n@@ sa betra@@ yed the world &apos;s trust -- time to act
the psychologists margaret mar@@ shall and john brown studied students with high and low expec@@ tations .
thousands of people started writing about this .
so they start moving from reality towards des@@ ire and they create their own special language to describe their vo@@ y@@ age of self-@@ discovery and self-@@ actu@@ alization .
then his main competi@@ tor went out and broke his record .
so islam@@ ism is the proble@@ ma@@ tic idea that really created a lot of problems in the 20@@ th century islam@@ ic world .
let me leave you with a final thought .
and so , little a@@ ja@@ x was born .
they came to earth brie@@ fly trans@@ formed to stop you from being arti@@ stic , from becoming artists .
now essentially , this repres@@ ented taking an aggressi@@ ve stance towards my own mind , a kind of psych@@ ic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow pro@@ gressi@@ vely ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing .
and the alli@@ ance has told me that they are very happy to work with it .
they &apos;re all made of the same stuff , but they want their shape to win .
&quot; yes , ma@@ ma . &quot;
eigh@@ ty to 90 percent of the world &apos;s pop@@ p@@ y , op@@ ium and hero@@ in , comes out of afghanistan .
and he had his arm out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched like someone out of the app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
but actually , what i &apos;ve been finding is very different from that .
har@@ ken@@ ing back to susan black@@ more &apos;s talk , we now have a means of trans@@ mit@@ ting information with her@@ edi@@ ty and selec@@ tion , and we know where that lea@@ ds .
all of us have to act to get it back .
and this one in the middle here , the large truck , is actually called the active den@@ ial system -- something the u.s. military is working on at the moment .
sa@@ dly enough , the fact rema@@ ins that a lot of the studies that are condu@@ cted in developing countries could never be auth@@ ori@@ zed in the richer countries which f@@ und the research .
so now let me introduce some of my fic@@ tional artists to you .
the honest off@@ ic@@ er can &apos;t hold you to it as being a bri@@ be , and therefore , you get the nu@@ is@@ ance of the traffic ti@@ cket .
and i found some aston@@ ishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me . fran@@ k@@ ly , in the days when i thought i &apos;d had it with religion , i just found the whole thing absolutely incredible .
great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p .
in the course of that book , he describes a moment -- just months after car@@ ol has died -- he comes across her picture on the man@@ tel , or on a bu@@ re@@ au in his bedro@@ om .
you should just come across to see how well our children do .
it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high .
i never felt like a victi@@ m , then or now .
and the point of these is they are , not quite , the secre@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from .
or , is it possible that we &apos;re just a bran@@ ch off of a multi@@ verse -- each bran@@ ch with its own big bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing dru@@ ms , maybe some without -- maybe some with sen@@ ti@@ ent life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundament@@ ally connected to us ?
willi@@ am ury , author of &quot; getting to yes , &quot; offers an elegant , simple way to create agre@@ ement in even the most difficult situ@@ ations -- from family conflict to , perhaps , the middle east . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s a revolution in that it &apos;s a change in equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the bam@@ bar@@ a bam@@ ana puppe@@ ts of mal@@ i in west africa , where there &apos;s a fab@@ ul@@ ous tradition of puppe@@ try , to learn a ren@@ e@@ wed , or a new , respect for this art form .
so in order to do that , i fo@@ unded a char@@ ter called gu@@ a africa , where we put kids in school .
speci@@ fically , we use these six design dire@@ cti@@ ves , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ -@@ focused design , it &apos;s not about designing for cli@@ ents anymore .
if you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re going to be the great develop@@ er of the map of the human genome , you &apos;d better know what a human genome is .
we &apos;re not doing that at any scale on govern@@ ance .
the most expensive real est@@ ate on this planet in every city -- wil@@ shi@@ re b@@ oule@@ vard , or fif@@ th a@@ venue , or to@@ k@@ yo , or paris -- the most expensive real est@@ ate is their down@@ to@@ w@@ ns .
what they look at is the most important thing .
here &apos;s the second thing i learned : my cli@@ ent will was not the exc@@ eption to the rule ; he was the rule .
no , they just had to con@@ form to the movement of the bridge .
because my job is spec@@ tr@@ os@@ copy .
le@@ e hot@@ z : inside an antar@@ ctic time machine
i did expect it to be difficult , have sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess ni@@ ghts , const@@ ant fee@@ dings , but i did not expect the feelings of is@@ ol@@ ation and lon@@ el@@ iness that i experi@@ enced , and i was really surprised that no one had talked to me , that i was going to be feeling this way .
and so they get re@@ born as whatever , you know .
it &apos;s only a problem now when the cho@@ col@@ ate is next to us .
we sat around and we talked about this -- we of course never resol@@ ved it .
the beautiful picture , by &#91; unclear &#93; in africa .
these are called ta@@ u ta@@ u .
it is basically moment@@ um to energy where the four@@ -@@ v@@ ec@@ tor is const@@ ant -- that &apos;s what it is .
that works very well in europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
there &apos;s one fellow out there , van pra@@ ag@@ h is his name , james van pra@@ ag@@ h .
one single act of violence can literally destro@@ y your movement .
symmetry , pa@@ irs .
the pro@@ visi@@ ons in the agre@@ ement may be complex , but so is the under@@ lying conflict .
and then i asked them , i said , &quot; what could the ce@@ o have done to make you not as depres@@ sed ? &quot;
and i &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have re@@ hear@@ sed it a few times .
first of all , i have to say i &apos;m not from around here .
and once you &apos;ve tra@@ ined up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be assig@@ ned or m@@ apped to any computing platform , appli@@ cation or device .
there &apos;s great conc@@ ern that bas@@ king sharks are de@@ ple@@ ted all throughout the world .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but you gave me the greatest gi@@ ft because i &apos;m going to die . &quot;
i think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring s@@ la@@ very to an end .
it &apos;s more ide@@ ological than practical , but it turns out it &apos;s an easy question .
so why is that ?
vin@@ ay ven@@ kat@@ r@@ am@@ an : yeah . that &apos;s right . okay .
this is si@@ err@@ a le@@ one .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these dis@@ orders , the one in five of us who strug@@ gle in some way , you find that there &apos;s a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predi@@ c@@ table patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these dis@@ orders .
it was not christ@@ mas time . there was a christ@@ mas tree .
in india we often love to compla@@ in about our government bodies .
and the top thing , actually , is the desk@@ bar .
by the way , i find hom@@ er gro@@ ening &apos;s film pres@@ ented a beautiful alternative to that very cla@@ im .
they &apos;re just information , why would they ?
the question today is not : why did we inv@@ ade afghanistan ?
it &apos;s important to remember that we all evolved in africa .
he used sh@@ ell companies .
and then , again , it &apos;s a spectrum : when you move in this direction , you &apos;re going to lose weight , you &apos;re going to feel better and you &apos;re going to ga@@ in health .
that &apos;s kind of bad .
this is the most de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing epide@@ mic of our time .
well you , my friend , you &apos;ve came to the right place .
here in the united states we spend more money per person for out@@ comes that are not better than many countries in the world .
and i can &apos;t begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side .
because actually radi@@ cal innovation does sometimes come from the very best , but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- un@@ met , lat@@ ent dem@@ and -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional , high-@@ cost solutions , which dep@@ end on profession@@ als , which is what schools and hos@@ pit@@ als are .
now how could that be ?
in fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies .
you &apos;re treating them as univer@@ s@@ als , to be ren@@ dered consi@@ stent by logic .
and so they &apos;re absolutely essential .
he &apos;s not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point , and he &apos;s working pretty hard .
and it &apos;s done in a very simple way : one just tou@@ ches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the bri@@ ght@@ ness , and on the other , the col@@ or@@ ation of the light .
when he does this , it &apos;s not , &quot; take your stra@@ di@@ vari@@ us and like j@@ im@@ i hen@@ dri@@ x , sm@@ ash it on the floor . &quot; it &apos;s not that .
long conflict can w@@ re@@ ck a country , leaving behind poverty and chaos . but what &apos;s the right way to help war@@ -@@ tor@@ n countries re@@ build ? at ted @ state , paul col@@ lier explains the problems with current post-@@ conflict aid plans , and sugge@@ sts 3 ideas for a better approach .
they said it was l@@ ous@@ y , and it was .
that is an absolutely fundamental physi@@ ological princi@@ ple .
and if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing how much 16@@ k is , this e@@ bay lo@@ go here is 16@@ k .
i want to talk today only about autonom@@ y .
in the 193@@ 0s , freu@@ d told us all that you could analy@@ ze people &apos;s psy@@ ches based on their dood@@ les .
we are one .
let me just show a map of rio again .
so now , what i can do -- i can aug@@ ment the world around me with this digital information .
and this is cri@@ tically important because , one year ago , the african pengu@@ in was decl@@ ared endangered .
what was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now r@@ ari@@ fied .
but think about me as a nurse , taking , re@@ moving the ban@@ da@@ ges of somebody i liked , and had to do it repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly over a long period of time .
so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-@@ bio@@ tic planet , because it &apos;s so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material , and therefore life could have evolved on it .
and that material indu@@ ced the body to switch back on a heal@@ ing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
and a te@@ ar gas c@@ ani@@ ster the size of a pe@@ p@@ s@@ i can goes by my head . wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
they &apos;re ex@@ posed to che@@ mic@@ als like chlor@@ op@@ ic@@ r@@ in , which was origin@@ ally used as a ner@@ ve gas .
another moment .
while young people seem to be very sure about their parti@@ cip@@ ation in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
we &apos;ve also got to cut the military about three percent a year .
this is one of the most un@@ healthy countries in the world .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
it &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of ch@@ and@@ ler , who , two months after we first met her , is now do@@ ings a back fli@@ p .
now we can be treated by smart medicine .
and the el@@ ev@@ ator door open@@ ed , and they all walked out .
so this star doesn &apos;t even appear until about two-@@ thirds of the way into this story .
in this eng@@ aging talk , world ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on whist@@ ler ge@@ ert chat@@ ro@@ u per@@ forms the wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal &quot; ele@@ on@@ ora &quot; by a. hon@@ ho@@ ff , and his own &quot; f@@ ê@@ te de la bel@@ le . &quot; in a fascinating inter@@ lu@@ de , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i may say , i may not see the church , or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow .
so i said , &quot; for two months , you were looking at stuff you didn &apos;t understand ? &quot;
both success@@ es and fail@@ ures teach us several cri@@ tically important things that we need to be@@ ar in mind if we want the good news to continue .
now this was 197@@ 3 .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
bill &apos;s hasn &apos;t .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
it consi@@ sted of huge clouds of hydro@@ gen and hel@@ ium atoms , and they have no structure .
imagine that there &apos;s a conc@@ ession period defin@@ ed of maybe 15 years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them .
the thing i did -- i pe@@ e@@ ked .
feeling and reality are the same .
second , men only .
three of them never showed up . one of them asked us if we would stay with hy@@ bri@@ ds and they would give us a dis@@ count .
ready ? bra@@ ce y@@ ourselves . here it comes .
she doesn &apos;t do it by quie@@ tly building one house at a time .
and i was there with my arms open .
how do i raise the self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em of a child and his acade@@ mic achie@@ vement at the same time ?
i must have done about 30,000 car@@ ic@@ atures .
now in the top 10 cities in the u.s .
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being se@@ cure .
but you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; new &quot; emer@@ ging from the &quot; old . &quot;
these are can@@ e to@@ ads in australia .
intervie@@ wer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
back to you , hen@@ ry .
first it el@@ ev@@ ates tac@@ tics over substance .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
my doctors diagn@@ osed me with chron@@ ic schizophren@@ ia , and gave me a pro@@ gn@@ osis of &quot; gra@@ ve . &quot;
so , i &apos;m either really good at fa@@ king it , or this particular model seems to work .
the rap@@ ing of the earth , the pil@@ la@@ ging of miner@@ als , the de@@ stru@@ ction of vag@@ in@@ as -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me .
in my hus@@ band &apos;s hom@@ eland in the hig@@ hl@@ ands of su@@ la@@ wes@@ i island in eastern indones@@ ia , there is a community of people that experience death not as a sing@@ ular event but as a gradu@@ al social process .
that was our first school . one hundred six@@ ty-@@ five children .
and this also happened to my girls as they began to see , and , we thought , maybe became an o@@ un@@ ce more compassi@@ onate .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
humans invented the idea of hos@@ pit@@ als and clin@@ ics in the 17@@ 80s . it is time to update our thinking .
and this is my profile .
and just to show you this , this is from the c@@ d@@ c .
so if you want to improve human@@ -@@ computer sym@@ bios@@ is , what can you do ?
the things that have to do with what is known as our internal mi@@ lie@@ u -- for example , the whole management of the chemi@@ stri@@ es within our body are , in fact , extremely main@@ ta@@ ined day after day for one very good reason .
and i think that &apos;s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
so we are still that magnificent country , but we are fu@@ eled by young people coming up from every land in the world , and it is our obli@@ gation as contribu@@ ting citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind .
but as we moved on to the period now , 100 years later , we &apos;re back really at another decision point .
so for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being he@@ ck@@ led .
yet the people inside africa have more genetic variation .
and one of them came to me the next morning and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve never listen@@ ed to classi@@ cal music in my life , but when you played that sh@@ opp@@ ing piece ... &quot; he said , &quot; my brother was shot last year and i didn &apos;t c@@ ry for him .
but i just want to say that i &apos;ve met girls with kni@@ fe wo@@ unds and ci@@ gar@@ ette bur@@ ns , who are literally being treated like ash@@ tra@@ ys .
if you think that 25 million people are infe@@ cted , if you think that the un@@ aids numbers are much too high , maybe that &apos;s more like 10 or 15 million .
as a result , we have g@@ arb@@ age pat@@ ches the size of twi@@ c@@ e-@@ texas .
this is just a pla@@ in statement of the facts .
and he becomes ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the question of how to drop bom@@ bs from an air@@ plane .
six months later , lea@@ h qu@@ it her job , and tas@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit was born .
now , it &apos;s not that che@@ mic@@ als are not important in psychiat@@ ric dis@@ orders .
so you have a peri@@ pher@@ y and a center which con@@ tains about 75 percent of all the play@@ ers , and in the center there &apos;s this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly inter@@ connected companies .
a few had good gra@@ des .
at these lar@@ ge-@@ scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of ma@@ k@@ es@@ hi@@ ft cam@@ p where workers live during the entire building process .
and the international mari@@ time organization respon@@ ded very str@@ ong@@ ly , &quot; these are the new lan@@ es . &quot;
he found himself in kenya on a ful@@ bright and he had a very interesting insi@@ ght , which is that he said , &quot; there must be entrepreneur@@ s in kenya ; there must be entrepreneur@@ s everywhere . &quot;
some of these o@@ f@@ ten@@ times have problems with reading .
we are the first generation which is in a position to do this .
and the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day , it imp@@ acts our entire life .
well , a very tiny fra@@ ction of them don &apos;t .
it began the space race .
antar@@ c@@ tica , if you inclu@@ de the ice shel@@ ves , is twice the size of australia -- it &apos;s a big place .
so say on the order of tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn &apos;t exist before .
and that happiness is a whole other end of the equ@@ ation .
yellow . blue . red .
i &apos;m not ready for jo@@ int re@@ plac@@ ement . &quot;
you can write pap@@ ers about complexity , and the nice thing about complexity is it &apos;s fundament@@ ally in@@ tra@@ c@@ table in many ways , so you &apos;re not responsible for out@@ comes .
this is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone .
it &apos;s really just for the sort of joy of its own tri@@ vi@@ ality .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corpor@@ ations and movie produc@@ ers ?
they are doing it because of one motivation only .
basically none .
5@@ 3 countries , and by far the most number of sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ously straight lines on the map .
and so we need gui@@ dance and we need di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic learning .
and then we look at what companies can do .
this is a toll cros@@ sing in bri@@ tain .
i &apos;m still using that old technology with a bi@@ cycle c@@ able on his right side .
and this kid is so swe@@ et . he made this trampol@@ ine sli@@ des@@ how ad@@ venture for his sister so that on her bir@@ th@@ day , she could be the star of the show , jum@@ ping on the trampol@@ ine to adv@@ ance the sli@@ des .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese busin@@ ess@@ man who saw our design and said , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the chinese character for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; so , appar@@ ently this is how you write &quot; people , &quot; as in the people &apos;s re@@ public of china .
they &apos;re going to say , &quot; hey , maybe it was those guys in pay@@ roll that for@@ ged those che@@ cks . &quot;
j@@ ill tar@@ ter : join the se@@ ti search
it goes on and on and on , all these values , all these numbers you don &apos;t know .
and some say this was the start of a global movement .
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
such a computer would open up univer@@ ses , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instru@@ ments .
now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sphere .
if you represent everyone , in some ways you represent no one .
and in south africa , we had taken our inno@@ v@@ ators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liber@@ ation from the dru@@ d@@ gery that people have .
art is the ultimate goal .
you can stand on one side of the world , whis@@ per something and be heard on the other .
so , instead , you know , my father &apos;s , like , arm &apos;s broken for two weeks in the store , and that week -- now , those two weeks were when my older brother and i had to do everything .
and from that comes the internet .
up goes the bird , out come the words , &quot; ju@@ ani@@ to , ju@@ ani@@ to , ven@@ te a com@@ er m@@ i hi@@ j@@ o ! &quot;
so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it bran@@ ches and bran@@ ches down to distan@@ ces about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little ro@@ dent .
so i went to conser@@ vation international and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valu@@ ing the fis@@ her@@ y resource , deci@@ ding how much ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i should be comp@@ ens@@ ated , what the range of the fis@@ hes were , brought in a whole bunch of other partners -- the government of australia , the government of new ze@@ al@@ and , the world bank .
and this lea@@ ther is 2@@ 1 la@@ yers thi@@ ck and quite op@@ a@@ que .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru@@ b it out from the center to the cor@@ ners , like this .
and the spi@@ der &apos;s web is for the r@@ eins on the horse .
in k@@ yr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , just over the last few weeks , un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented levels of violence occurred between ethnic k@@ yr@@ gy@@ z and ethnic u@@ z@@ be@@ ks .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
and what we &apos;re finding is actually , even at the brain bio@@ chemical level , we are quite similar .
and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be able to do that painting . &quot;
in some countries , 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 7 percent of children survive to five years of age ; others , only 70 . and here it seems there is a gap between o@@ ec@@ d , latin america , east europe , east asia , ar@@ ab states , south asia and sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
it hit in what we now know as yu@@ cat@@ an , the gulf of mexico .
check out this video that ma@@ d@@ die from my period three class sent me that evening .
our econom@@ ies in the developed world have co@@ ast@@ ed along on something pretty close to full emplo@@ y@@ ment .

thank you , james , for your great inspiration .
i automa@@ tically wanted to see this ship , this magnificent ship , basically in all its gl@@ ory , and conver@@ sel@@ y , i wanted to see it not in all its gl@@ ory , basically go back to what it looks like .
and the most amazing thing about the upper pal@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic art is that as an aes@@ thetic expression , it la@@ sted for almost 20@@ ,000 years .
the other way that they are better is actually being able to resol@@ ve different levels of gray .

should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
it &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
so you &apos;re building on something that is not p@@ ure self-@@ interest .
this was a huge lea@@ p , because bab@@ b@@ age is there saying , &quot; we could compu@@ te these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graph@@ s , &quot; — — and lo@@ vel@@ ace is there and she says , &quot; look , this thing could even comp@@ ose music if you told it a repres@@ entation of music nu@@ mer@@ ically . &quot;

we looked at sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ er construction , we looked at the avi@@ ation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have check@@ li@@ sts .
we &apos;re moving to this integration of bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cine , information technology , wireless and , i would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
indeed , people were over@@ -@@ enthusi@@ astic in the early 200@@ 0s , thinking america could do anything , which led us into some dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous foreign policy ad@@ vent@@ ures , and now we &apos;re back to decl@@ ine again .
if he &apos;s using land@@ mark ori@@ entation , he should be able to find the bur@@ row , because he &apos;ll be able to recognize the land@@ mar@@ ks around it .
it &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
pretty smart -- they don &apos;t want to get killed by a cat .
he said , &quot; look , these are the stron@@ gest and most able men in the country .
that &apos;s where the real profit comes .
i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works .
his biggest ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , really , was the mark@@ et@@ place , which demand@@ s these days bright yellow fo@@ ie gras .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re more neuro@@ tic than everyone else ; it &apos;s just that you &apos;re more honest about how neuro@@ tic you are . &quot;

for some people , we vari@@ ed how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could ste@@ al .
it &apos;s also obje@@ c@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
ok , let &apos;s go back to mr. el@@ m@@ o .
mus@@ cles will amp@@ li@@ fy the ner@@ ve signals about a thousand@@ -@@ fold , so that we can record them from on top of the skin , like you saw earlier .
it &apos;s during our life@@ time that we &apos;re going to take the earth , take the people of earth and transition off , perman@@ ently . and that &apos;s exciting .
and they take the dirty she@@ ets down to the laun@@ dry .
right ? this is the change in li@@ king sc@@ ore , the change from the first time they ran@@ ked to the second time they ran@@ ked .
and you know , i came back to school , i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a ban@@ j@@ o player .
have we ever heard of a d@@ ust mi@@ te ?
instead of seeing its primary obje@@ ctive as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of parti@@ cip@@ ation -- the shi@@ ft from a passi@@ ve relationship between consumer and produ@@ cer to the active enga@@ gement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and prof@@ it@@ able .
this is a point clou@@ d .
the thing i had to admit to myself , with great re@@ pul@@ sion , was that i get it .
that is , you ask any gen@@ eric question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many bran@@ ches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flo@@ wing through each bran@@ ch , what is the size of the can@@ op@@ y , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
but we also ha@@ dn &apos;t pre@@ tended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lun@@ ch .
iran is doing that right now .
this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony bla@@ ir at the da@@ vo@@ s for@@ um in 2005 , when his dood@@ les were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was lab@@ eled the following things .
and he took it upon himself to print 5@@ 5,000 speech bub@@ bles -- empty speech bub@@ bles stick@@ ers , large ones and small ones .

so architecture maybe is not so big , like science , but through its fo@@ cal point it can le@@ verage in an archi@@ medi@@ an way what we think the world is really about .
sh : well , i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
stat@@ us-@@ driven , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous consumption thri@@ ves from the language of no@@ vel@@ ty .
and it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blo@@ bs around the big yellow blo@@ b .
remember that we scan@@ ned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about ti@@ me@@ -@@ syn@@ ced activity in similar or different areas si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regi@@ ons when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communic@@ ating .
and what these guys need , actually , is access to capital .
one dig@@ it at a time , i shall try and determine the dig@@ it you &apos;ve left out .
people actually volunte@@ er for this , and they usually come out kind of ra@@ ving about their productive time in the hole .
you might look at mich@@ ig@@ an and say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in produ@@ cing the gu@@ ts for the electric vehicle , like the li@@ thi@@ um i@@ on battery .
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to ne@@ da , people who are pre@@ vent@@ ing the security services of iran finding those people who are blog@@ ging out of iran , any by everybody who is blog@@ ging , changing their address to te@@ hr@@ an , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
it &apos;s not being im@@ posed by fi@@ at from above .
and when we do and it swi@@ ms , we see this magnificent ba@@ thy@@ me@@ try that the shar@@ k knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawa@@ ii .
but then one night , my mom was cooking gri@@ ll@@ ed chicken for dinner , and i noticed that the ed@@ ges of the chicken , which had been mar@@ in@@ ated in le@@ m@@ on ju@@ ice , turned white .
because what we &apos;ve created is a sort of field of dre@@ ams , when it comes to medical technology .
and sometimes people ask me , &quot; well , what about an accident ? &quot;
so for example , they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for ya@@ ho@@ o on the mar@@ ch 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , sk@@ yp@@ e , apple and so on .
they actually do condu@@ ct a few investi@@ ga@@ tions over@@ seas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year .
the war is so worrying at present , with cour@@ t cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
and poli@@ cing copyright viol@@ ations for children &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day c@@ ak@@ es was such a h@@ ass@@ le that the college b@@ ak@@ ery said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the ab@@ sur@@ d .
and in 30,000 square meters of stat@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ art green@@ houses , there , we are m@@ ass@@ -@@ produ@@ cing those predat@@ ory mit@@ es , those minute pi@@ rate bu@@ gs , those par@@ asi@@ tic was@@ ps , etc . , etc .
we took a lot of horizon@@ tal sli@@ ce images through me , produced those sli@@ ces and then used those to build a c@@ ad model .
and that &apos;s exactly what he did .
but the ir@@ ony is that it might only be in recogni@@ zing our limit@@ ations that we can really actually over@@ come them .
so there is a re@@ form agenda , and there is an inclu@@ sion agenda .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
it was made to play hawa@@ i@@ ian music back in the 19@@ 20@@ s , before they had electric guit@@ ars , trying to make a lou@@ d guit@@ ar .
if that sing@@ le-@@ st@@ ability system , that brain that flies that aircraft , fail@@ s , or if the engine fail@@ s , that vehicle crash@@ es . there is no option to that .
and what we &apos;re going to do is , we &apos;re going to have all of the profess@@ ors allow you to go to class .
so 18 months ago i got this email that changed my life .
first thing that you do is you sel@@ ect a star in the night sky , if you &apos;re telling time at night .
but , you know , there are ways out .
ok , other organizations we &apos;ve been working with , uc mer@@ ced , people know about uc mer@@ ced .
we repe@@ ated the experiment with the same two groups , this time ad@@ ding a del@@ ay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started ans@@ wer@@ ing the questions .
thank you .
it only looks like nothing &apos;s moving because , well , saturn here is 7@@ 00@@ ,000 miles away , and titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
in the winning life edi@@ ted sche@@ me in a ren@@ der here , we com@@ bine a moving wall with trans@@ former fur@@ ni@@ ture to get a lot out of the space .
ok , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the fi@@ ve-@@ ball pattern is , i &apos;m going to give you a little cl@@ ue .
and that &apos;s the way i work now .
go back and get them , and then bring them back and drop them in front of him .
and i want to know how the money you &apos;re going to get from me is going to help you get there .
they use it sy@@ ne@@ c@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
a little present for you .
i am hon@@ ored to be here , and i &apos;m hon@@ ored to talk about this top@@ ic , which i think is of gra@@ ve importance .
so i went to col@@ om@@ bia . and i re@@ produced the experiment .
in the history of the past 50 years , the smo@@ king risk shows how a model changes , and it also shows how an industry fi@@ ghts against a model it doesn &apos;t like .
t@@ d : and i still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father , al@@ b@@ eit in@@ frequ@@ ently .
i stand here to say that ir@@ ani@@ an women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
i &apos;m going to show you our lat@@ est dat@@ as@@ et .
so the idea that we dep@@ lo@@ yed the tro@@ ops to respon@@ d to the taliban in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy is mista@@ ken .
she mur@@ mur@@ s a pra@@ yer and she goes ahead with the operation .
listen as chinese students practice their english by scre@@ aming it .
that doesn &apos;t work .
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
if they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
what do you see here ?
&quot; from 5@@ 2 to 48 with love &quot; was a project around the time of the last election cycle , where mc@@ ca@@ in and obama both , in their spee@@ ches after the election , talked about re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and i was like , &quot; what the hell does that look like ? &quot;
so this shows you one particular game called an ultimat@@ um game .
j@@ u : no , it has to be for every human being .
i was lucky ; i had heard about him for years , and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum in ch@@ eng@@ du .
i &apos;ve written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l@@ .@@ a. times .
and so how did she get edu@@ cated then ?
right now on the hor@@ n of africa , we &apos;ve been through this before .
so we &apos;re pul@@ ling out all the stops .
and on one particularly dark day for me , jason sat down and he wrote an email .
this guy over here of course is me .
but actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14 .
and i went , very e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly , to see it , because -- well , also , with an eye on this conference .
this , like i say , is a c@@ ad model of me , and this is one of the later c@@ ad models .
population of phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a : it has 1.@@ 5 million people .
it &apos;s really amazing .
there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some swit@@ ches that turn your genes on and off , the gir@@ ders of the cell , mot@@ ors that move your mus@@ cles .
i wanted you to see this g@@ aller@@ y because it &apos;s as good as it gets .
that was the year when queen vic@@ tor@@ ia was able , for the first time , to communicate with president bu@@ chan@@ an , through the trans@@ atlan@@ tic tele@@ graphic c@@ able .
people often ask me what i learned from that time .
the long-@@ la@@ sting damage of nuclear radi@@ ation caused an entire city and its population to turn into po@@ w@@ der .
we knew they worked through ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned trial and er@@ ror .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
the european rab@@ bit has no natural predat@@ ors in australia , and it compe@@ tes with native wil@@ d@@ life and dama@@ ges native plants and de@@ gra@@ des the land .
but the materi@@ ality matters too , because in every society that anthrop@@ ologists have looked at , material stuff oper@@ ates as a kind of language -- a language of goo@@ ds , a symboli@@ c language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories , for example , about how important we are .
people said , &quot; that &apos;s crazy . you can &apos;t .
they don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very clou@@ dy anyway .
so is it really a mira@@ cle of mary , or is it a mira@@ cle of mar@@ ge ?
that &apos;s a lot of women who don &apos;t get justice .
you can make reason@@ able predi@@ ctions about how cars be@@ have .
that is about as high as you can get .
let &apos;s fly to another one .
so that &apos;s john@@ ny dep@@ p , of course .
and i can see how it might dance .
so there are two options : intelli@@ gent design , dire@@ ct and indi@@ re@@ ct -- so god , or my friend .
i &apos;ve been to some of those contin@@ ents , but africa was , in the words of steven pin@@ ker , was a b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late , lar@@ gel@@ y .
this is all you &apos;ve got . you &apos;re very ex@@ posed on the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge .
we are at a private school in the american west , sitting in red vel@@ v@@ et cha@@ irs with money in our po@@ ck@@ ets .
but it doesn &apos;t re@@ act very well to being immer@@ sed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
we actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
and it happens when you &apos;re in a new or un@@ familiar situation .
either they will go on for the next 40 years , 50 years , 60 years .
they were going very slowly .
now , i remember speaking to an indones@@ ian friend of mine , fran@@ kie .
this is actually in the wh@@ it@@ ney museum , where there were six of them , each of which had a different argument on it , different sound fi@@ le .
smaller space is going to make for smaller u@@ tili@@ ties -- save some more money there , but also a smaller foot@@ print .
and i use this little image to say this is what happens to mos@@ ses .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are said .
you can say a mira@@ cle occur@@ s .
and through work@@ sh@@ ops they developed innovative new products , services , and business models .
i found a couple in nor@@ way last year . we &apos;re seeing them on the ice .
so just like with a bike , we don &apos;t talk about it .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re bad at doing .
they all live in col@@ on@@ ies consi@@ sting of one or a few que@@ ens , and then all the ants you see walking around are steri@@ le female workers .
but this one morning i jum@@ ped in and found this thres@@ her that had just recently died in the g@@ ill net .
he would come every day with something to show me .
and if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also ste@@ al the future , we &apos;re going to run out of future really fast .
there may be vision scientists among you .
and the level in which klei@@ ber is in control is in a different level .
this is a project called flight patterns .
thank you .
i love that because there is like a whole demographic : un@@ atta@@ ched hi@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ pers .
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metap@@ hor@@ ical meaning from what i &apos;d previ@@ ously interpre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al truth .
imagine you are being asked to pay a bri@@ be in your da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day life to get something done .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
but it &apos;s the ri@@ des@@ h@@ are board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
i &apos;m at a business school , so that &apos;s what we do .
today , it &apos;s closer to 8@@ 2 percent .
and you take your dna back to the labor@@ atory and you cl@@ one it .
now unlike a human@@ -@@ designed computer , where there &apos;s a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work , because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells , maybe tens of thousands .
and you can actually see that the lic@@ en@@ se pla@@ te of the sam@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ rus .
and who gets to answer those questions ?
does it mat@@ ch one african or the other african ?
it was a solar wind inter@@ ac@@ ting with our i@@ on@@ os@@ phere that he was listening to -- a phenomen@@ a which we can see at the extreme northern and sou@@ th@@ ern la@@ titu@@ des of our planet as the au@@ r@@ ora .
it &apos;s hard to go to your bos@@ s and say , &quot; i have an excell@@ ent idea for our organization .
you know , they are generally put together in pa@@ irs , creating a word or what we call base pa@@ irs .
if you think about it , the cost of pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ating international rules is z@@ il@@ ch -- nothing .
there are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to pro@@ mote positive effects , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to call the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i side of the equ@@ ation .
like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal im@@ mi@@ gration .
actually , the answer is more nu@@ an@@ ced and sub@@ tle than that .
he literally had nothing . he was a virtual skelet@@ on , yet he could still su@@ mm@@ on the coura@@ ge and the will to move .
&quot; jim , now it &apos;s time . you &apos;re the down , oh . &quot;
one of them is to take that real ...
they can be put in a glo@@ ve com@@ partment , ok .
i think that &apos;s , you know , part of how it &apos;ll work .
they have to , in 2005 , have a distinct identi@@ ty for all their models of cars .
and sometimes things are okay .
now , there &apos;s a similar situation in the classi@@ cal music world , because there are some people who think that classi@@ cal music is dying .
and that &apos;s why what i &apos;m excited about , and what i think is under@@ -@@ repor@@ ted , is the significance of the rise of online video .
boys and girls watching , study physics .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;ll pay you two cents for your contribu@@ tion . &quot;
to work with the positive and negative in a different way .
i finished the swim like this .
now , you may ask about these kids .
it &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
now , let me be clear about what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conc@@ ei@@ vable moral question .
now the ir@@ ony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues of one form or another .
i mean , they weren &apos;t really je@@ ans , they were more kind of , like , leg@@ g@@ ings , but , like , i guess they &apos;re actually kind of more like je@@ g@@ g@@ ings , like , but i think — &quot; and you &apos;re just like , &quot; oh my god .
in the 195@@ 0s , hong kong was a place where millions of people could go , from the main@@ land , to start in jobs like se@@ wing s@@ hir@@ ts , making toys .
two million at 100,000 .
in su@@ ther@@ land &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
and the women were saying , &quot; no wonder we have no si@@ de-@@ effects .
and it &apos;s the idea that we don &apos;t have dis@@ pos@@ able anything .
in a cam@@ p with 9@@ 0,000 people , you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fi@@ ghts .
we are not even two bit@@ es into bre@@ ak@@ fast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tra@@ cking me .
david hu@@ gh@@ es at o@@ hi@@ o state university has written a pri@@ mer on af@@ ro@@ cent@@ ric architecture in which he &apos;s used some of these fra@@ c@@ tal structures .
this may be surprising , because we can , of course , look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from .
throughout human evolution , multiple versions of humans co-@@ exi@@ sted . could we be mid-@@ up@@ grade now ? at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , juan en@@ ri@@ que@@ z swe@@ ep@@ s across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is reve@@ aling evidence that sugge@@ sts rap@@ id evolution may be under way .

think about the following intui@@ tion .
it was extraordinary .
that &apos;s a bad day at the office .
well , it just can &apos;t . that &apos;s it .
now let &apos;s go back to the oil and mining companies , and let &apos;s go back to dan e@@ tete and that $ 1 billion deal .
and i &apos;ll probably get cho@@ ked up , because i tend to when i talk about this .
so , the first kind of test product we did was with al@@ ess@@ i , which was for a coffee and te@@ a set .
who are we to pre@@ tend that we know so little about human well-@@ being that we have to be non-@@ judg@@ mental about a practice like this ?
so in this much no@@ isi@@ er world , it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more exp@@ lic@@ it about our moral code .
they had to intu@@ bate her , so they put a tube down her thro@@ at and they began to mechan@@ ically venti@@ late her .

what &apos;s funny about being down to four houses ?
it &apos;s sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding and pl@@ ywood .
as soon as it tou@@ ches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air .
the math ser@@ ves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .

and one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share .
and a sl@@ inger is someone who has a lea@@ ther p@@ ou@@ ch with two long cor@@ ds atta@@ ched to it , and they put a proje@@ cti@@ le , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the p@@ ou@@ ch , and they wh@@ ir@@ l it around like this and they let one of the cor@@ ds go , and the effect is to send the proje@@ cti@@ le forward towards its target .
and i think every human , we all have different genetic back@@ gro@@ unds , we all have lived separate lives .
and these raised and energ@@ y-@@ efficient homes were developed by bra@@ d pit@@ t and make it right for the har@@ d-@@ hit n@@ in@@ th ward .

as the l@@ ength of the construction takes years , workers end up forming a rather r@@ ough@@ -@@ and-@@ ready in@@ for@@ mal city , making for quite a ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ i@@ tion against the sop@@ hi@@ sticated structures that they &apos;re building .

they have combined the list of major innova@@ tions , and they &apos;ve discovered that the greatest number , the greatest decade , for fundamental innova@@ tions , as refle@@ cted in all of the li@@ sts that others have made -- was the great depression .
so that red line there was something that a lot of skep@@ tics said the environ@@ ment@@ alists only put in the proje@@ ctions to make the proje@@ ctions look as bad as possible , that emis@@ sions would never grow as fast as that red line .
so they said , &quot; we haven &apos;t given up .
you &apos;ll never sing again , said her doctor . but in a story from the very edge of medical possibility , oper@@ a@@ tic sop@@ ran@@ o char@@ ity til@@ le@@ man@@ n@@ -@@ dick tells a double story of survival -- of her body , from a double lung transp@@ l@@ ant , and of her spirit , fu@@ eled by an un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ing will to sing . a powerful story from ted@@ med 2010 .
all easier said than done .
it &apos;s a ligh@@ ter part and it uses less material waste .
i don &apos;t think you understand . i think your phone lines are un@@ man@@ ned .
it &apos;s also kind of a pro@@ test , a personal pro@@ test , against the culture we have now where people just are at concer@@ ts with their cell phones out recording the whole conc@@ ert , and they &apos;re dist@@ ur@@ bing you .
because i imagine the director : &quot; ma@@ z , i think your character would rob the bank with a bom@@ b around him . &quot;
you know the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch companies are actually going inside us and plan@@ ting their little fla@@ gs on our genes .
and he was saying : does he really want to meet another doctor ?
and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .
sw : again .
it was so simple , in fact , that i suspe@@ ct a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calcul@@ us , could understand what he wrote down .
you &apos;re a fantastic , creative musi@@ cian , and i think that was no@@ where clear@@ er to see , really , than when we went to slo@@ ven@@ ia , and someone -- in a longer conc@@ ert we tend to get people jo@@ ining in , and this person , very , very nerv@@ ously came onto the stage .
and ni@@ mo@@ y , i &apos;m sorry , spo@@ ck si@@ ts down at the piano , and he starts playing this bra@@ h@@ ms wal@@ tz , and they all dance to it .
so if you tell me the size of some company , some small company , i could have predi@@ cted the size of wal@@ m@@ art .
in fact , you could come down to the tree to get your gif@@ ts and get ready to sing , and then get ready for bre@@ ak@@ fast without even taking a bath or getting dres@@ sed , except that da@@ d@@ dy mess@@ ed it up .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
a year later , i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
and the first thing that i want to talk about , the first thing i think we need to understand is : how do people respon@@ d to the epide@@ mic ?
it &apos;s made by the company think fun .
but i really want you to learn .
and we &apos;re also their clos@@ est cou@@ sin .
and i have a little sign on my fri@@ dge , and it says , &quot; because i &apos;m the da@@ d@@ dy , that &apos;s why . &quot;
exter@@ nal ac@@ tors can only present to you an opportunity .
but this is what we suspe@@ cted . and these molecules , especially me@@ than@@ e and ethan@@ e , can be li@@ qui@@ ds at the surface temper@@ atures of titan .

and yes , it &apos;s a little nerv@@ e-@@ w@@ ra@@ cking .
so , in con@@ clu@@ sion , i &apos;m going to show you an ani@@ ma@@ tion that basically shows you how these or@@ bits have been moving , in three dimensions .
but we &apos;ve cent@@ r@@ alized these bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cies .
global warming is already affec@@ ting people .
and then when i wrote this book , and all of a sudden it just took off , then i started saying , now , what &apos;s the purpose of this ?
design , the art of organi@@ zing the world of things .
so you see up there one such object .
what &apos;s significant is not simply the light and dark surro@@ unds that matter .
my own mother — and i should say this here — she same to this country in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , and she was , you know , she found her@@ self pre@@ gn@@ ant , as women did in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s . you know what i mean ?
but we discovered it by self-@@ explor@@ ation .
so it could be that the path@@ ways that i &apos;ve been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the wor@@ m , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
so they &apos;re really small , generally , they &apos;re square and fl@@ at and hard , and fran@@ k@@ ly , most of them just aren &apos;t very attra@@ ctive , and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the out@@ come of designing electronics .
cars are drama@@ tically clean@@ er , drama@@ tically sa@@ fer , more efficient and radi@@ cally more aff@@ ord@@ able than they were 100 years ago .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person car@@ rying out , the more re@@ moved he would be from his personal sphere .
i usually have to just like try to cal@@ m down and take a deep breath .
and it &apos;s a very horrible thing to see an@@ arch@@ y , to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military tro@@ ops there -- actually can &apos;t stop that r@@ amp@@ aging mo@@ b who &apos;s coming down the street .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i was in such a state of depression , and all i could think about was sir ran@@ ulp@@ h fi@@ en@@ nes .
they called me two weeks later , they &apos;re like , oh , yeah , you can come now . and i told them to stuff it .
there &apos;s fran@@ cis up on the upper right , and al@@ ex rich -- the m@@ .@@ d@@ .-@@ tur@@ ne@@ d-@@ cr@@ y@@ st@@ allo@@ grapher -- is next to me .
now i &apos;m going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit .
i &apos;m going to do it car@@ efully , but i &apos;ll do it .
well , not too long after that , i found this guy , the@@ ven@@ in , and he said that he was cul@@ tur@@ ally jewish , he said that his job was an ar@@ ctic baby se@@ al h@@ unter , which i thought was very cle@@ ver .
and very quickly , just to cl@@ ari@@ fy .
it l@@ eng@@ th@@ ens , shor@@ tens and ben@@ ds really easily in response to internal or exter@@ nal forces .
dan@@ a : that way .
i decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; lon@@ ge@@ vity escape vel@@ o@@ city . &quot;
and it &apos;s a wonderful bit of ge@@ ar , because it &apos;s like having a flying tri@@ po@@ d , c@@ ran@@ e and dol@@ ly all roll@@ ed into one .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the see@@ ds of their own compassion had never been wat@@ ered .
yes .
there is no text@@ books , i mean , not yet , anyway .
j@@ h : and they &apos;re non-@@ deter@@ mini@@ stic .
this is the dra@@ wing .
it &apos;s not an either / or ; it &apos;s an &quot; and . &quot;
was i what had been done to me ?
if we know people who are planning to support or@@ phan@@ ages , we should convin@@ ce them to support family services instead .
it will dry up inside .

co@@ ding can also en@@ able you to expres@@ s your ideas and feelings in your personal life .
smo@@ king is in some deep sense negative sa@@ vings .
because at the end of the day , dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth .
before i could turn around , everyone on the tra@@ cks was scre@@ aming and running .
that &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?
so he basically set up , or basically sh@@ at@@ tered the suspen@@ sion of dis@@ belief , because what he photograph@@ ed was the real thing , a mir su@@ b going down , or actually two mir sub@@ s going down to the real w@@ re@@ ck , and he created this very ha@@ un@@ ting footage .
audience : yeah . j@@ y : thank you .
it &apos;s not like you say , &quot; hey jo@@ e , i &apos;m having erec@@ tile dy@@ s@@ function , how about you ? &quot;
what &apos;s the difference between those ?
so acu@@ men made not one , but two bridge lo@@ ans , and the good news is they did indeed meet world-@@ quality classi@@ fication and are now in the final st@@ ages of clos@@ ing a 20-@@ milli@@ on-@@ dollar ro@@ und , to move it to the next level , and i think that this will be one of the more important companies in east africa .
oh my god .
i re@@ moved the micro@@ phone from that , and then just pin@@ ched that -- like i just made a clip out of the micro@@ phone -- and cli@@ pped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
so what i do is , i buy a pre@@ paid card like this .
and i was ou@@ tra@@ ged .
and with treatment , it is a mana@@ ge@@ able condition .
and she said , &quot; dr. col@@ es , i am not talking ; i &apos;m pra@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; one has only to gl@@ ance at its press fil@@ ms , fashion shows , beauty con@@ tests , ball@@ rooms , wine bars and broad@@ ca@@ sting sta@@ tions . &quot; memes .
and then with an instrument we have on board , a ra@@ dar instrument , we found there are la@@ kes like the great la@@ kes in here , so it looks very much like earth .
and my final question was always the same .
the final challenge is for all of you .
and i whis@@ per@@ ed the good news through my broken ja@@ w , which was wired shu@@ t , to my night nurse .
we need rela@@ tive fig@@ ures that are connected to other data so that we can see a ful@@ ler picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
but where i think compu@@ tational speed is most app@@ lic@@ able is in that of ima@@ ging .
if you dri@@ ll water to make co@@ ke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it co@@ sts the community .
it &apos;s the other way around .
if you have an industry that puts a s@@ mile on people &apos;s face , that &apos;s n@@ oll@@ ywood .
reading and enjo@@ ying liter@@ ature and words that begin with &apos; b. &apos; &quot; the bath : &quot; assem@@ ble students on a ru@@ g and give students a war@@ ning about the danger@@ s of hot water .
so if that &apos;s the case , that &apos;s difficult , because per@@ su@@ asi@@ on is really difficult .
or e@@ din@@ burgh .
an 18@@ -year-old boy who uses tex@@ ting for almost everything says to me wi@@ st@@ fully , &quot; some@@ day , some@@ day , but certainly not now , i &apos;d like to learn how to have a conversation . &quot;
now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wal@@ let .
our children are becoming depres@@ sed at an al@@ ar@@ ming rate .
it &apos;s very similar to what you do when you design your product .
you have to sing &quot; aa@@ aa@@ a@@ ah , &quot; and i &apos;ll stop you .
to further support my argument , here is a picture that spea@@ ks for itself .
e : me@@ o@@ w .
each an@@ ther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen , so , it &apos;s quite pro@@ li@@ fic stuff .
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the re@@ ef@@ s provide a place where all these micros@@ cop@@ ic animals or mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic animals grow , and when they die , their sh@@ ells and their te@@ eth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth .
because now the light is going through a yel@@ lo@@ wish filter and then a pur@@ pli@@ sh filter .
irri@@ gation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it , as op@@ posed to where the ri@@ vers flo@@ od . you start getting this organic agriculture ; you start putting machin@@ ery onto this stuff . machin@@ ery , with a whole bunch of water , lea@@ ds to very lar@@ ge-@@ scale agriculture .
no , the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s tail results from the mat@@ ing cho@@ ices made by pe@@ a@@ h@@ ens .
again , that &apos;s one of the the@@ mes that i think has come through lou@@ d and clear in this conference is : where do we start ? how do we start ? what do we do to start ?
histor@@ ically , we &apos;ve always ac@@ ted as victi@@ ms of something or somebody .
and so to think that i had found my way , to found a career that takes me -- really , one of the big sa@@ y@@ ings in social work is , &quot; le@@ an into the dis@@ com@@ fort of the work . &quot;
and so the process began and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t put it all on an island ; some of it has to be on the main@@ land because we don &apos;t want to turn our back to the community . &quot;
three years later , when i fell in love with a man , nei@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ ash either .
now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road .
now i &apos;m going to tell it to you , and it &apos;s going to seem obvious that that is cor@@ re@@ ct , and that &apos;s the point , right ? then i &apos;m going to have to make an argument why you &apos;re in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct about the other as@@ su@@ mption .
but here &apos;s what we can say : what &apos;s natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cool@@ ing down .
fair enough .
instead , you can make a recip@@ e for how to have a team that &apos;s prepar@@ ed for the un@@ expected .
the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this hig@@ gs partic@@ le , and we &apos;re almost certain it will .
ok .
na@@ thal@@ ie m@@ ie@@ b@@ ach : art made of storms
but the second example i want to give you is , i happened to be an early guinea pig , and i got very lucky to have my whole genome sequ@@ enced .
there &apos;s a famous story about the great rab@@ bi , hil@@ le@@ l , the older con@@ temporary of jesus .
it takes the base metal of our conven@@ tional wisdom and trans@@ forms it through ri@@ di@@ cu@@ le into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world .
when was the last time your physi@@ cian asked you where you &apos;ve lived ?
but the bottom line is that there is a way , when there are more women at the table , that there &apos;s an attemp@@ t to develop some understanding .
an@@ na m@@ ra@@ ce@@ k die@@ tr@@ ich : a plane you can drive
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de use tremend@@ ously .
does that make sense ?
but the point is , if the feature you &apos;re obser@@ ving can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wi@@ der landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply mis@@ gui@@ ded .
the problem is that we play the role of victi@@ ms .
now this cos@@ mic knowle@@ d@@ ge-@@ based view may -- and i think ought to -- make us feel very special . but it should also make us feel vulnerable , because it means that without the specific knowledge that &apos;s needed to survive the on@@ going challenges of the universe , we won &apos;t survive them .
and they started to quickly imit@@ ate the sounds they were hearing on the key@@ board .
oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country &apos;s dis@@ integration .
yeah , there we go . yeah , ok ?
the question is : what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture , and what &apos;s it going to mean for women ?
so in 2007 we had an ex@@ hibi@@ tion , a small ex@@ hibi@@ tion of this cro@@ ch@@ et re@@ e@@ f .
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environ@@ ment@@ ally friendly way .
je@@ ws are very interested in for@@ gi@@ veness and how we should start an@@ e@@ w and start af@@ res@@ h .
so digital mammo@@ graphy has been a giant lea@@ p forward for manufac@@ tur@@ ers of digital mammo@@ graphy equipment , but it &apos;s been a very small step forward for wom@@ an@@ kind .
the may@@ o bro@@ thers came out to visit li@@ ster in europe .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spa@@ ti@@ al operating environment , we call it .
if you had to walk a mile for a ju@@ g of water every day , as millions of people do , it &apos;s un@@ likely you &apos;d use that pre@@ cious water to ba@@ the . young entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r lu@@ dwi@@ ck mar@@ is@@ han@@ e tells the amazing , funny story of how he invented a cheap , clean and convenient solution : dr@@ y@@ bath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th-@@ sub@@ stit@@ u@@ ting lo@@ tion .
and on the left side , you &apos;ll see the process@@ ed video where the camera has made him invisible .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my ey@@ es@@ ight and was parti@@ ally paraly@@ zed .
on the le@@ ft-@@ hand side , you see his original pros@@ thesis , and he &apos;s using those swit@@ ches to move little blo@@ cks from one box to the other .
he &apos;s my don@@ or .
he came up to me and said , &quot; thank you for starting mov@@ ember . &quot;
on the contr@@ ary , because we bring it to every cultural p@@ lot where the balance was already dis@@ rup@@ ted by the che@@ mic@@ als .
and the fact that i asked for help -- how many people jum@@ ped on board ?
we can plant those in the ground .
and so , coming directly from there to here .
this is perhaps a first element of a change .
you belie@@ ved in your principles .
if you are bu@@ ying something on the web , you &apos;re supposed to put in your address and you &apos;re supposed to choose which country you &apos;re from , ok ?
and , with that , comes the third point , which is obli@@ gation -- and an obli@@ gation to that avail@@ ability .
collabor@@ ator three : for all of the fr@@ ames to be dra@@ wn by fan@@ s , each individual frame , it &apos;s got a very powerful feeling to it .
some of it ran off as f@@ loo@@ ding , but most of the water that so@@ ak@@ ed into the soil simply ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated out again , exactly as it does in your gar@@ den if you leave the soil un@@ covered .
she &apos;s a physicist , and somehow sta@@ ys s@@ mil@@ ing , in spi@@ te of everything going on back home .
so what &apos;s a good definition for cy@@ bor@@ g ?
so this bur@@ den of knowledge drives me .
this solution has been called , by some , &quot; potenti@@ ally the most important medical adv@@ ance this century . &quot;
so , you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small econom@@ ical brains and not waste their time cop@@ ying all this stuff , and the memes themselves , like the sounds that people made and cop@@ i@@ ed -- in other words , what turned out to be language -- compe@@ ting to get the brains to get bigger and bigger .
the importance is what you do with the images , the statement it makes where it &apos;s pa@@ sted .
also , another sense which com@@ ics &apos; vision represents , and that &apos;s time .
and as i sat con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating what to say , a woman appro@@ ach@@ ed in a black sha@@ w@@ l and black ro@@ be .
b@@ c : we enter the mar@@ ti@@ an atmosphere .
and this happens every two weeks .
j so these are -- as far as we can tell -- classi@@ cal whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well , for the life of the car .
i believe you should be on time . but i felt at practice , for example , we start on time , we close on time .
but it never stru@@ ck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no mil@@ k to nurse .
now , i &apos;m not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stom@@ ach , but i am suggesting it &apos;s possible we might want to manage ga@@ stri@@ c secre@@ tion in the gut .
b@@ hu@@ tan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the ne@@ west democracy in the world , just two years ago .
wa@@ el gh@@ on@@ im : inside the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an revolution
but does it really work ?
and eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve ma@@ ster@@ y .
another stati@@ stic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood de@@ a@@ ths .
and given this , we started getting questions like , &quot; if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and lea@@ ther ? &quot;
now let &apos;s take the ban@@ ks first .
it also aff@@ or@@ ds us cheap fabri@@ cation , which is fantastic , so it means that you can do a lot more with it .
finger , finger , finger , finger . yellow .
yeah , interesting , but a little dangerous .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions it &apos;s a non@@ profit , a community bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch lab in brooklyn , new york , and the idea was people could come , they could take class@@ es and pu@@ tter around in the lab in a very open , friendly atmosphere .
what you learn when you go to australia is the austr@@ ali@@ ans are very competi@@ tive .
so this gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te or ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te of data , we &apos;re putting it into this block .
this is more than hiv / aids , malaria and tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis combined .
and india will no longer have to wit@@ ness this cru@@ el bar@@ b@@ ari@@ c practice which has been here for cent@@ uries .
we even built a theater there -- 3d movie .
western world is a long life in a small family .
now , when psychologists show you bars , you know that they are showing you a@@ ver@@ ages of lots of people .
we need our best and our bri@@ gh@@ test to start enter@@ ta@@ ining this issue .
and it &apos;s not like you could send them a text or sho@@ ot them an e-mail , so i was literally left to my own devices .
there &apos;re no sil@@ ly bu@@ o@@ yan@@ cy tan@@ ks -- it &apos;s perman@@ ently , posi@@ tively bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant .
perhaps the ad@@ dition of m@@ s. goo@@ de is what made this story more complete .
it &apos;s a char@@ it@@ able enti@@ ty , basically a gr@@ ant@@ -@@ giving enti@@ ty that gives money back to indi@@ gen@@ ous groups around the world for edu@@ ca@@ tional , cultural projects initi@@ ated by them .
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
&quot; the world will not be sa@@ ved by the internet . &quot;
walking up@@ right , we are told , is the threshold of what made us human .
l@@ ol@@ cats are c@@ ute pictures of cats made cu@@ ter with the ad@@ dition of c@@ ute cap@@ tions .
because especially now with the economic crisis , you can see that the trust in poli@@ tics , that the trust in democra@@ tic institutions , was really destro@@ yed .
later on , i ear@@ ned an m@@ b@@ a at stanford .
un@@ co@@ ordin@@ ated care today is expensive at best , and it is de@@ adly at worst .
i then read him a chap@@ ter of ro@@ ald da@@ hl &apos;s &quot; james and the giant pe@@ ach . &quot;
so you talk to people in the fashion industry and they &apos;re like , &quot; sh@@ h@@ h !
we could use amin@@ o acids , we could use nu@@ cl@@ ei@@ c acids , car@@ box@@ y@@ li@@ c acids , f@@ at@@ ty acids .
but the pace of expon@@ ential growth is really what describes information technologies .
although , god knows , of late , in our hu@@ br@@ is , we seem to have dri@@ f@@ ted away .
can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were 17 ?
these three objects over there are hard drives with a blue@@ to@@ oth connection . but they &apos;re in reality very , very beautiful sculp@@ ted arti@@ facts that con@@ tain the whole desk@@ top and computer memory of somebody who passed away .
den@@ is du@@ tton : a dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an theory of beauty
now , you have a secret mission too .
they asked governments for suppor@@ ting reg@@ ul@@ atory regi@@ mes , and in a lot of cases they got it .
well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspe@@ cts to it .
people now solved seven questions on average .
i want to share all my love with you ...
but about two cent@@ uries before david , the hit@@ ti@@ tes had discovered the secret of sm@@ el@@ ting and process@@ ing of ir@@ on , and , slowly , that sk@@ ill spread .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t en@@ joy anything after that .
they use it for finding food , for attra@@ cting mates , for de@@ fen@@ ding against predat@@ ors .
we can pe@@ er inside our heads and interact with what was once lo@@ cked away from us , what once my@@ sti@@ fied and separated us .
he had this sho@@ e@@ box that he car@@ ried with him everywhere con@@ ta@@ ining nine com@@ ic books , two g@@ .@@ i@@ . jo@@ es pain@@ ted to look like spi@@ der@@ -@@ man and five go@@ bot@@ s . and this was his tre@@ as@@ ure .
magic tricks , i think they &apos;re in@@ struc@@ tions , sort of like recip@@ es : no copyright protection .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses , who has fla@@ ws , who is maybe not immediately lik@@ able , but eventually rel@@ at@@ able .
now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using exper@@ ts to help us figure things out , for sure -- i don &apos;t want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limit@@ ations and , of course , also our own .
and on a f@@ actual basis , over 80 percent of the u.s. &apos; s most popular shows are expor@@ ted around the world .
i in@@ tend to lead that expedition .
so it su@@ ms up a lot of what we &apos;re talking about .
we might get two or three dead sharks was@@ h@@ ed up in ir@@ eland a year , if we &apos;re kind of lucky .
the best measure of that : so you go into one of his games , you create a character that you develop in the course of the game .
this is the re@@ te . okay . do you see that ?
when i was little -- and by the way , i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18@@ th century wat@@ ch@@ maker .
that 14@@ -year-old kid would say : &quot; oh , well ... &quot;
famous for its diversity , human diversity .
it was like , 1@@ 60 dollars for this ?
one is called sop@@ a , the other is called pi@@ pa .
i work with a special i work with pre@@ c@@ ision -- oh , sorry -- control and a very powerful ...
and that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as hon@@ ored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural mi@@ lie@@ u .
and they are in our back@@ y@@ ard .
but cam@@ bo@@ dia is not alone .
because ca@@ it@@ ri@@ a and i live here in boston .
and this is just the first of these .
we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why .
it was a m@@ ash@@ -up that used data that we collected from people , and we put it on our map .
and imagine , just consider this idea , if you would : what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass ?
i was like , &quot; yes ? &quot;
for .
the value of nothing : out of nothing comes something .
and like hit@@ ler , go@@ ering fan@@ ci@@ ed himself a colle@@ ctor of art .
for three years , they were in hi@@ ding .
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they &apos;ve done all the work , and i &apos;m the great bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it@@ ter that tries to bring it all together .
businesses of america need to support mr@@ s. obama to do the things that she wants to do .
this all came from a professor wa@@ king up at night to the third night in a row that his wife &apos;s cell@@ phone was be@@ ep@@ ing because it was running out of battery power .
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
maybe i can use my je@@ wel@@ ry to create extra sounds .
ice she@@ ets would continue to dis@@ inte@@ gra@@ te for cent@@ uries .
the fda estim@@ ates that of all the americ@@ ans who have tat@@ to@@ os , 17 percent of us regre@@ t getting them .
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
it actually is a very good working su@@ b -- that &apos;s what it was designed for .
maybe this is because femin@@ ism , unlike almost every other social movement , is not a strug@@ gle against a distinct op@@ pres@@ s@@ or -- it &apos;s not the rul@@ ing class or the occu@@ pi@@ ers or the coloni@@ z@@ ers -- it &apos;s against a deeply held set of belie@@ fs and as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions that we women , far too often , hold ourselves .
it is technology that has made them different , and as we see what this technology can do , we need to recognize you can &apos;t kill the inst@@ in@@ ct the technology produ@@ ces . we can only crimin@@ alize it .
&quot; everything we do , we believe in challenging the status qu@@ o .
and just after this photo was taken we walked up the sta@@ irs .
very next day , i b@@ opp@@ ed into school with my brand new air j@@ or@@ dan@@ s , man , i was cool .
but perhaps they knew that on six@@ th , no@@ v@@ ember , 200@@ 9 , there will be a ted green and blue s@@ ession , so they pain@@ ted it like this .
now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingredients in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
ap@@ es , dolphins and eleph@@ ants are animals with remarkable communication skills . could the internet be exp@@ and@@ ed to inclu@@ de sen@@ ti@@ ent species like them ? a new and developing idea from a pan@@ el of four great thin@@ kers -- dol@@ phin resear@@ cher di@@ ana rei@@ s@@ s , musi@@ cian peter gab@@ ri@@ el , internet of things visi@@ on@@ ary neil ger@@ sh@@ en@@ feld and v@@ int cer@@ f , one of the fa@@ thers of the internet .
i have my entire new york city board of education trans@@ cri@@ pt from kinder@@ garten through college .
and as a matter of fact , then , this is one of the reasons why we must ex@@ clu@@ de them from this country so , with sen@@ ti@@ ments like these , the chinese ex@@ clu@@ sion act was sort of passed between 18@@ 8@@ 2 and 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the only time in american history when a group was speci@@ fically ex@@ clu@@ ded for its national orig@@ in or ethni@@ city .
why are you figh@@ ting so hard not to be yourself ?
angry , fru@@ str@@ ated , really up@@ set about the state of her society and the state of her children , this young girl started a movement , a movement of ordinary women band@@ ing together to build peace .
now , let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem , because it &apos;s more sub@@ tle and perhaps difficult to gras@@ p .
the red do@@ t is the laser light of the sub@@ marine al@@ vin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the v@@ ents .
and when i first came across it in the early &apos; 90s , i thought my pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , mal@@ col@@ m dy@@ son and bo@@ b wright , had really taken leave of their sen@@ ses , and i &apos;ll explain to you why this was the case .
she had gotten carb@@ op@@ latin tax@@ ol , carb@@ op@@ latin tax@@ ot@@ ere , gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine , na@@ vel@@ bine : every drug we have she had gotten , and that disease continued to grow .
chris and i were really ama@@ zed by the potential now with modern web brow@@ s@@ ers , where you have h@@ t@@ m@@ l@@ 5 audio and video and the power of ja@@ v@@ as@@ cri@@ pt to ren@@ der ama@@ zingly fast .
sur@@ ge@@ ons still had a bit of a p@@ r problem , because the landscape was domin@@ ated by the it@@ in@@ er@@ ant bar@@ ber surgeon .
he got demen@@ tia anyway .
and i think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
but that was before she got cap@@ gras syndro@@ me .
there &apos;s stro@@ mat@@ oli@@ tes down there -- the first living things to capture phot@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis -- and it &apos;s the only place they still occu@@ r today .
so we have an idea of how to play seriously , creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an e@@ ye@@ drop full of material , and we create everything we can see in any direction , right , from almost nothing -- that is , something extremely tiny , extremely small -- and it is almost perfect , except it has these tiny flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations at a part in 100,000 level , which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see , that is , galaxies and stars and so forth .
here &apos;s a calcu@@ lation that shows how the intensi@@ ty of a bar@@ bec@@ ue , or other radi@@ ant heat source , goes as you move away from it .
that we could take people who had the fear that they weren &apos;t creative , and we could take them through a series of ste@@ ps , kind of like a series of small success@@ es , and they turn fear into famili@@ ar@@ ity , and they surprise themselves .
and if i zo@@ om in to lower manhattan you can see the ex@@ tent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into mana@@ ge@@ able ch@@ un@@ ks .
and you can put it on top of any image .
i wish i was that co@@ ordin@@ ated .
and we make it incredibly easy to volunte@@ er .
the largest organis@@ m in the world is in eastern or@@ eg@@ on .
each government has a task force . this perhaps is less interesting , but we &apos;re trying to get the governments to all work together , and it &apos;s not easy .
and we got the same remarkable results .
by 20@@ 15 , we &apos;ll be 100 percent better c@@ ot@@ ton .
and she ans@@ wer@@ ed , &quot; a pen@@ is . &quot;
so that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand to get the average to a thousand .
thank you .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i ha@@ dn &apos;t thought of doing that .
it &apos;s the only prof@@ ession where you have to believe in the future .
musli@@ ms reg@@ ard jesus as the master of su@@ fis@@ m , the greatest pro@@ p@@ he@@ t and m@@ essen@@ ger who came to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze the spiritu@@ al path .
pres@@ um@@ ably we &apos;ll ban them , but then we &apos;ll have the spec@@ ter of teenagers in their high schools gy@@ ms rou@@ tin@@ ely out@@ -@@ per@@ forming the olymp@@ ic ath@@ le@@ tes .
so that , as ele@@ an@@ or ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt said once of human rights , the same is true of gender equ@@ ality : that it starts in small places , close to home .
and again , it &apos;s actually a rel@@ ie@@ f for what &apos;s going on in china because i think on the table right now , there &apos;s 27 nuclear power sta@@ tions to be built .
let &apos;s now switch and think about a potential for human imp@@ acts .
i also had the good fortun@@ e to be in those lec@@ tures , up in the bal@@ con@@ y .
not to pick on pit@@ ts@@ burgh , but most american cities really have evolved this way .
so she made a film about the wel@@ f@@ are system and had a huge impact .
because what stem cells are -- they &apos;re these phenomen@@ al cells that really have the ability to differ@@ enti@@ ate into any type of tissue .
it learned to move and began to see . the first eyes grew on tri@@ lo@@ bit@@ es .
so what you are seeing here are the la@@ yers on the wall of that cr@@ ater , and the ro@@ ver is going down now , meas@@ uring , you know , the proper@@ ties and analy@@ zing the rocks as it &apos;s going down , you know , that canyon .
the majority of people .
even though it is the case that poverty is lin@@ ked to aids , in the sense that africa is poor and they have a lot of aids , it &apos;s not necessarily the case that impro@@ ving poverty -- at least in the short run , that impro@@ ving expor@@ ts and impro@@ ving development -- it &apos;s not necessarily the case that that &apos;s going to lead to a decl@@ ine in hiv pre@@ val@@ ence .
i have come to think it &apos;s one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sor@@ row .
now just to give you some perspective of this bal@@ lo@@ on , the little black dots are people .
and i just remember feeling all these stories came out of the wo@@ od@@ work , and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women that i now was a part of , which was re@@ ass@@ uring and also really concer@@ ning .
and for the next 11 years , i s@@ wor@@ e nobody would ever find out that i couldn &apos;t see , because i didn &apos;t want to be a failure , and i didn &apos;t want to be weak .
it un@@ fol@@ ds .
and global capital is ag@@ no@@ stic -- it has no lo@@ y@@ al@@ ties .
and then what ?
now , i worked on that theory for a while , with stephen ha@@ w@@ king and others .
by the way , men@@ gat@@ ou@@ e was the sh@@ am@@ an of his tri@@ be as well .
but i &apos;ll just close what i &apos;ve been talking about by leaving you with this message : may you find an exc@@ use to reach out to some long-@@ lost pal , or to that college room@@ mate , or to some person you may have turned away from .
if you are a resear@@ cher , i hold you to a higher standard of moral con@@ science , to remain eth@@ ical in your research , and not com@@ promise human wel@@ f@@ are in your search for answers .
so you may wonder , why on earth are they doing it ?
when they &apos;re monit@@ oring your cli@@ ck@@ stre@@ am -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time fig@@ uring out your age , your gender and your income .
re@@ al-@@ world problems are often ambi@@ gu@@ ous and ill@@ -@@ defin@@ ed and the context is always changing .
the@@ od@@ or gei@@ sel , better known as dr. se@@ uss , he dre@@ am@@ ed up many of his amazing cre@@ ations in a lon@@ ely b@@ ell tower office that he had in the back of his house in la j@@ oll@@ a , california .
it &apos;s a medi@@ um-@@ si@@ zed nu@@ cle@@ us .
now if that were true , it &apos;s a true con@@ dem@@ nation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places .
philosop@@ her@@ s know this game very well .
they &apos;re not waiting until they die to create foun@@ da@@ tions .
we have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
it was then , after such hard work and many fru@@ str@@ ating years that we found sel@@ am , and you see the face here covered by sand@@ stone .
it rea@@ ds the shif@@ ting conditions of temperature , hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty , wind direction , wind speed , de@@ w point , and it process@@ es this data in a central computer that c@@ ali@@ br@@ ates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout .
all of you here are tremend@@ ously im@@ bu@@ ed with tremendous amo@@ unts of knowledge and what i &apos;d like to do is invi@@ te each and every one of you to contribu@@ te to this project and other projects of its type , because i think together we can truly change the landscape of education and edu@@ ca@@ tional publi@@ sh@@ ing .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much re@@ vered by society , which are people that engage in multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tasking .
now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the ab@@ uses of personal information are like bringing a kni@@ fe to a g@@ un@@ fight .
now , he really loved to issue pres@@ identi@@ al de@@ cre@@ es .
take a look at what that is !
the king respon@@ ded in a fashion that actually has trans@@ formed us four decades later .
what happens when you design a service that is so appro@@ pri@@ ate for a particular person -- that &apos;s exactly what they need at this moment in time ?
this is , the kids will feel the therapeu@@ tic object needs him .
i &apos;ve sat in a lot of those me@@ etings , and by then , it is way too late to use the data .
and then when they failed , they started speaking about con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cies that emer@@ ged from tel avi@@ v and washington in order to divide the ar@@ ab world .
you still have to report the inci@@ dent .
i believe the government should do more , but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction .
mark bit@@ t@@ man : what &apos;s wrong with what we eat
okay , so ju@@ lian made this video .
this is my nie@@ ce , i love her , she &apos;s my sister &apos;s daughter .
and three years later , 1@@ 37 species of birds are living here .
in part , amp@@ hibi@@ ans are good indi@@ cat@@ ors and more sensitive because they don &apos;t have protection from cont@@ amin@@ ants in the water -- no eg@@ g@@ sh@@ ells , no mem@@ bran@@ es and no plac@@ ent@@ a .
so , pretty early on in my investi@@ ga@@ tions i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find , which was , quite fran@@ k@@ ly , a lot of be@@ er can pyram@@ ids and over@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed cou@@ ches and fl@@ at@@ -@@ screen t@@ v@@ s .
for hundreds of years , the pre@@ vail@@ ing or@@ tho@@ do@@ x@@ y , the accep@@ ted truth , was that god the father , the cre@@ ator , is un@@ changing and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sa@@ dness .
of course , these technologies imp@@ ly a shif@@ ting of cost and re@@ ven@@ ues between data hol@@ ders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don &apos;t hear more about them .
we have hear , this week , about the horrible suff@@ er@@ ings , for example , that so many women of the world are en@@ during da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day .
well , there are two ways of getting there .
this cell phone started its tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory in an arti@@ san@@ al mine in the eastern con@@ go .
and also , could you create the worst possible ted@@ talk that they would still let you get away with ?
we have talked about it end@@ less@@ ly over the last decade or so .
and what you &apos;re typ@@ ing are recor@@ dings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peop@@ les &apos; eyes .
i was like , &quot; david cri@@ es when you invi@@ te him to take a walk . &quot;
so some of the mon@@ ks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves .
i don &apos;t really look that ug@@ ly , but the camera is so close that it &apos;s just di@@ stor@@ ted .
i &apos;ll see you later .
this is the main pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an mall ; we did it in 72 hours . yes , you have to be fast .
that picture on the left is just st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing to me .
if you really care about starting a movement , have the coura@@ ge to follow and show others how to follow .
and why this whole thing makes sense .
left -- it &apos;s my right .
and you &apos;re on one side or the other .
so we came up with a list of requi@@ re@@ ments , the &quot; 10 comm@@ and@@ ments , &quot; and they were , in order of as@@ cen@@ ding difficul@@ ty : the first is &quot; no magic . &quot;
so get on your kne@@ es and repe@@ at it . &quot;
there are three under@@ p@@ inn@@ ings of working in space priv@@ ately .
at this point , something else happened .
and this is what we turn them into .
wright argu@@ es that technology has increased the number of posi@@ tiv@@ e-@@ sum games that humans tend to be em@@ bro@@ iled in , by allo@@ wing the trade of goo@@ ds , services and ideas over longer distan@@ ces and among larger groups of people .
and so what i &apos;m going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you en@@ coun@@ ter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deli@@ ver and when they don &apos;t and why .
we know , and i know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
it &apos;s not just , &quot; wow , isn &apos;t that cool ? &quot;
what do the people bring into the situation ?
and this is all done , by the way , by the international a@@ stronom@@ ical union .
so our feeling is , if it &apos;s good enough for the ru@@ g@@ by team , it &apos;s good enough for health and poverty .
it was , &quot; he said , &quot; one of the most powerful moments of life together .
and anti@@ mon@@ y you know , i &apos;ve got to tell you , one of the greatest benefits of being a professor : col@@ ored ch@@ al@@ k .
so what are we trying to find out ? we &apos;re foc@@ using on the pac@@ i@@ fic .
the moral of this story is all these narra@@ tives about rise and fall and decl@@ ine tell us a lot more about psych@@ ology than they do about reality .
now , while prepar@@ ing for the tour , i had to re@@ mind the guys to be cul@@ tur@@ ally sensitive .
in ad@@ dition to this kind of high-@@ resol@@ ution ge@@ ome@@ try , since it &apos;s all cap@@ tured with camer@@ as , we &apos;ve got a great tex@@ ture map to use for the face .
i learned about this from a professor at u.@@ c. da@@ v@@ is called jason de@@ j@@ ong .
it actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there .
right . articles about water , ads about water .
when she came into my life , we were figh@@ ting against a huge waste fac@@ ili@@ ty plan@@ ned for the east river water@@ front , despite the fact that our small part of new york city already hand@@ led more than 40 percent of the entire city &apos;s commercial waste : a se@@ wage treatment pel@@ le@@ ti@@ zing plant , a se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge plant , four power plants , the world &apos;s largest food distribution center , as well as other industri@@ es that bring more than 6@@ 0,000 dies@@ el truck tri@@ ps to the area each week .
you think it &apos;s bad to lose one arm ?
now , the explor@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not in@@ tend to inv@@ ent the transi@@ stor .
people will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other .
so they &apos;re mo@@ du@@ lar reac@@ tors that are built essentially on an assem@@ bly line , and they &apos;re tru@@ cked anywhere in the world , you p@@ lo@@ p them down , and they produce electricity .
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a sp@@ ons@@ or , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cr@@ ass version of our fo@@ unding story .
we asked students who were walking by to partici@@ pate in a study , and we took a shot with a web@@ c@@ am , and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop .
these days , those phones in our po@@ ck@@ ets are changing our minds and hear@@ ts because they offer us three gra@@ ti@@ fying fantas@@ ies .
who thinks that c is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take less time to see head-tail-@@ head than head-tail-@@ tail ?
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
so kind of out of des@@ per@@ ation , i decided that i could think lat@@ er@@ ally .
i took here a model from robo@@ tics -- it &apos;s called the sub@@ su@@ mption architecture .
be@@ au lot@@ to : so , this game is very simple .
we found that the indu@@ s scri@@ pt actually falls within the range of the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic scri@@ p@@ ts .
where are the baby dinosau@@ r@@ s ? in a sp@@ ell@@ bin@@ ding talk pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ologist jack hor@@ ner describes how sli@@ cing open fossi@@ l sk@@ ul@@ ls reve@@ aled a sho@@ cking secret about some of our most belo@@ ved dinosau@@ r@@ s . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and then there &apos;s a co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in along the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , where tel avi@@ v is now .
now our friend over there , al@@ bert einstein , used to pay very little attention when people said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a man with an experiment that seems to dis@@ agree with special rela@@ tivity .
so , yes , i want to take g@@ phin ; i want to build on it ; i want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can ; i want to make this open to everybody so that the health off@@ ic@@ er in nai@@ rob@@ i or in pat@@ na , bi@@ ha@@ r will have as much access to it as the folks in ot@@ ta@@ wa or in c@@ d@@ c ; and i want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es of humanity , and that it &apos;s accessi@@ ble to everyone .
here i am now , if this is the end ? thank you .
if you look car@@ efully , you can even see a hin@@ t of the apple men@@ u , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally pun@@ ched through to the physical .
and this one , which is really telling , this was from ju@@ ly , this cover article : &quot; the personal me@@ tri@@ cs movement goes way beyond di@@ et and exer@@ cise . it &apos;s about tra@@ cking every fac@@ et of life , from sleep to mo@@ od to pain , 24 / 7 / 3@@ 65 . &quot;
we &apos;re so good at this we don &apos;t really even notice it .
and i think more and more people are also asking : why bo@@ ost consumption , rather than change what we consu@@ me ?
so this is the project . here &apos;s how it started .
and of course it &apos;s not just religious people who believe in the gol@@ den rule .
if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a si@@ ck@@ -@@ care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?
unfortunately , i picture it made in ger@@ many or japan , but this amazing machine that &apos;s constantly sc@@ our@@ ing every bit of human ende@@ a@@ vor and taking resources , money , labor , capital , machin@@ ery , away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts , and while this might cause temporary dis@@ location , what it does is it buil@@ ds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fa@@ de away and die , and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient , so much richer for everybody .
that &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
i have the wr@@ ist ro@@ tation that goes -- and it can go all the way around .
and suddenly the author appeared in our do@@ or@@ way , and i remember him sort of sa@@ unter@@ ing down the a@@ is@@ les , going from kid to kid looking at the des@@ ks , not saying a word .
and there &apos;s schools and clin@@ ics and sh@@ ops .
so , at this time , i &apos;d like to tell you the words in@@ scri@@ bed upon the ha@@ yes h@@ all tower b@@ ells : &quot; all truth is one .
the dic@@ tionary is not car@@ ved out of a piece of gr@@ ani@@ te , out of a l@@ um@@ p of rock . it &apos;s made up of lots of little bits .
scientific studies recom@@ men@@ d that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prote@@ cted .
let &apos;s take the example of the heart , the top@@ ic of a lot of my research .
i stayed after they lo@@ ot@@ ed everything .
well , then you could do an organ .
let &apos;s think of life as that entire planet because , in a sense , it is .
imagine being able to -- and , again , it &apos;s a tem@@ pl@@ ated process , and it soli@@ di@@ fi@@ es out of a li@@ qu@@ id process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .

when we walked through the sa@@ van@@ na a thousand years ago we made line@@ ar predi@@ ctions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it &apos;s hard@@ wired in our brains .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sour@@ ces of ad@@ ult stem cells .
these are just some of the listening posi@@ tions , or sc@@ ales of listening posi@@ tions , that you can use .
the connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even eth@@ ically possible .
there &apos;s none of the ti@@ re@@ dness .
it is critical , as these virtual worlds continue to mi@@ r@@ ror the real world we live in , that game develop@@ ers realize that they have tremendous responsi@@ bilities before them .
and in fact , the ultimate search engine would be smart .
i worked alone .
thank you .
if you want to make a dinosau@@ r , you go out , you find yourself a piece of pe@@ tri@@ fied tree sa@@ p -- otherwise known as am@@ ber -- that has some bloo@@ d-@@ su@@ cking insects in it , good ones , and you get your inse@@ ct and you dri@@ ll into it and you su@@ ck out some dna , because obviously all insects that su@@ cked blood in those days su@@ cked dinosau@@ r dna out .
and we &apos;re going to atta@@ ch these memor@@ ies to sensors , and the sensors will experience re@@ al-@@ live , re@@ al-@@ world data , and these things are going to learn about their environment .
so better to sh@@ y away from , to ignor@@ e , the moral and the religious con@@ vi@@ ctions that people bring to civi@@ c life .
perhaps that was the inten@@ tion .
so most of my work , i don &apos;t use gl@@ ue .
poor people are a resource .
that &apos;s where we put our people in the mri machine .
and technology is really tur@@ bo@@ char@@ ging this .
you know , if this is so , it occurred to me that maybe , just maybe , the primary obje@@ ctive of our brains is to serve our dignity .
and he said it such a long time ago .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of no@@ where .
we need to have the bios@@ phere proper@@ ly expl@@ ored so that we can understand and compe@@ t@@ ently manage it .

and i &apos;m gr@@ at@@ eful for the opportunity to share this vo@@ y@@ age with you today .
with de@@ wor@@ ming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .
i was in@@ formed by this kind of un@@ original and tri@@ te idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation , which is what dro@@ ve me then , and still , it &apos;s a del@@ usion that drives me now .
he held the post that newton held at cambridge , and that was recently held by stephen ha@@ w@@ king .

the average li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood is only 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; well maybe my li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood is about 35 percent . &quot;

if you were born after computers and paper , it doesn &apos;t really matter which order you &apos;re taught with them in , you just want to have the best tool .
you think the a.@@ u@@ . will put together a conference like this ?
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fra@@ ction of them have photos of the mer@@ ma@@ id par@@ ade .
if you read management books now , a leader is somebody who can fo@@ ster creativity , who can get his -- get the employees -- see , i still say &quot; his &quot; -- who can get the employees to talk to each other , who can basically build teams and get them to be creative .
but why ? what &apos;s at sta@@ ke here ? what does it matter ?
a@@ ver@@ ting the climate crisis
the extra amount that dis@@ appeared last fall was equivalent to this much . it comes back in the winter , but not as perman@@ ent ice , as thin ice -- vulnerable . the amount rema@@ ining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
thank you .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
the teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percent@@ ages as they were before .

so now you may be wonder@@ ing , why does anyone get married ever ?
this visu@@ alization could explain , for example , why new@@ bor@@ ns , or smo@@ kers , put , inst@@ in@@ cti@@ vely , their fing@@ ers in the mouth .

the inter@@ relationship of nations , well it &apos;s always exi@@ sted .
and the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neu@@ tr@@ ality .
so again , here we are at that equ@@ ator moment .
all the people who partici@@ pate in social media networks bel@@ ong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers have used in order to understand them .

so in one of their projects called sou@@ th@@ war@@ k circle , they worked with resi@@ dents in sou@@ th@@ war@@ k , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new mem@@ ber@@ ship organization to help the el@@ der@@ ly with house@@ hold tas@@ ks .
so , this ship was basically the size of the marri@@ ot@@ t hotel , a little t@@ aller and a little bigger .
and you colle@@ ct a big number of ex@@ es .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that under@@ p@@ ins this transition approach .
so an example of that is , here &apos;s the map of the united states .
it &apos;s all about sen@@ su@@ ality . it &apos;s all about touch .
we are nearly on the edge of a crisis , but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and , in fact , of our century .
and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in har@@ mon@@ y with nature .
they had heard bin laden say that that was ji@@ had , and cla@@ im@@ ed vic@@ tory for it . and so the old ima@@ m worried that his words were falling on de@@ af e@@ ars . no one was pa@@ ying attention .
and each time we have some ice in the future , we have to know that life will be great , and the success will be brilliant if we d@@ are to over@@ come our fear of the ice , to go through the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , to go through the problem , in order to see what there is on the other side .
people were cooking on their only fuel source , green ti@@ mber .

there &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
we were both th@@ under@@ ing through this incredible si@@ beri@@ an da@@ wn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason b@@ our@@ ne and wil@@ fre@@ d thes@@ iger . part of me felt quite pr@@ ou@@ d of myself , but mostly i was just ut@@ ter@@ ly terri@@ fied .
you probably had no idea . it &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
tw@@ enty years ago , rob@@ ert ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d used the prison@@ er &apos;s di@@ le@@ m@@ ma as a probe of the biological question : if we are here because our ancestors were such fi@@ er@@ ce competi@@ tors , how does co@@ operation exist at all ?
they put it into wor@@ m recom@@ po@@ sting systems , which produced a lot of wor@@ ms , which they fed to si@@ beri@@ an stur@@ geon , which produced ca@@ vi@@ ar , which they sold back to the restau@@ ran@@ ts .

you &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
at that time at the beginning of the &apos; 90s , we had that problem , which was , you know , survival below one side , but what was really pain@@ ful for me was , remember , the beginning of the &apos; 90s , y@@ ug@@ os@@ la@@ via is falling apart .

this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antar@@ ctic .
because i think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space , rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
the point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer , in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different mean@@ ings , but with the same words .
perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
i tell you , there is no rest for the fashi@@ on@@ able .
i think the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by redu@@ cing the differences in in@@ comes between us .
if you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it off@@ ered you some warm@@ th , some food , shel@@ ter , and maybe the car@@ ing attention of a nurse .
now , this has , of course , some imp@@ li@@ cations , and so we developed three imp@@ li@@ cations of this research .
thank you .
can you see the four ways of seeing the cu@@ be ?
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
but i &apos;m thinking , you know , they probably had the &quot; share &quot; button a little bit bri@@ gh@@ ter and to the right , and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always parti@@ cip@@ ating on these networks .
charles darwin said , &quot; i sometimes think that general and popular tre@@ a@@ ti@@ ses are almost as important for the progress of science as original work . &quot;
you could consider this state boun@@ dar@@ ies , if you will , those pretty bro@@ ad out@@ lines .
it &apos;s not all fun and games .
and so this is what i did .
and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the glob@@ alization of english .
that &apos;s an engine@@ er ga@@ zing at tube number 3@@ 6 , trying to figure out why the memory &apos;s not in focus .
we are completely infe@@ cted . and beauty can be the result of this infe@@ cti@@ ousness ; it &apos;s quite wonderful .
it &apos;s un@@ consci@@ ous .

now , as we breathe , we produce carbon di@@ oxi@@ de , and that carbon di@@ oxi@@ de needs to be sc@@ ru@@ b@@ bed out of the system .
and it &apos;s exciting . when you see ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as up here talking about his $ 100 computer , the most passionate exciting thing is : here &apos;s a genius , but he &apos;s got a call@@ ing now .

so let me explain how this works .
little lar@@ va@@ e hat@@ ch out in fres@@ h water .
it &apos;s no money down , and your u@@ tili@@ ty bill de@@ cre@@ as@@ es .
they &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
and if that weren &apos;t bad enough , if it wasn &apos;t just the production of plastic that &apos;s giving people cancer in places like &quot; cancer alle@@ y &quot; and shor@@ ten@@ ing lives and hur@@ ting poor kids at the point of use , at the point of dis@@ pos@@ al , once again , it &apos;s poor people who be@@ ar the bur@@ den .
it &apos;s time to stop building the sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ alls , the pris@@ ons , the sta@@ di@@ ums and other tribu@@ tes to all of our colle@@ ctive fail@@ ures .
theore@@ tically what this means is that in order to expres@@ s this gene , in a violent way , very early on , before pu@@ ber@@ ty , you have to be involved in something that is really trau@@ ma@@ tic -- not a little stress , not being span@@ ked or something , but really seeing violence , or being involved in it , in 3d .
friends like lu@@ al who died by my side , of starvation .
but that &apos;s just the beginning .
google is one of our big partners here .
so we measu@@ red nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
you ought to be able to go to a psychiat@@ r@@ ist or a psych@@ ologist , and put down your 1@@ 0-@@ dollar cop@@ ay , and get treated , just like you do when you got a cut on your arm . it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
and it was designed to be a robot di@@ et@@ -@@ and-@@ exer@@ cise co@@ ach .
en@@ ric sal@@ a : glimp@@ ses of a pri@@ st@@ ine ocean
well , this is what they are .
this is actually just a micro@@ organis@@ m .
that is the ro@@ cket designer &apos;s dream .
he goes off and wins seven ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ ships he never once won before the cancer , because he got emotional fit@@ ness , psych@@ ological str@@ ength . that &apos;s the difference in human beings that i &apos;ve seen of the three million that i &apos;ve been around .
and they can &apos;t go even to university .
maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
we &apos;re trying to find the beauty in the truth .
i work with tw@@ y@@ la th@@ ar@@ p a lot , and i work with mark mor@@ ris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
you have these rap@@ i@@ dly emer@@ ging bike lan@@ es all over the world . i lived in manhattan for 15 years .
biological -- there &apos;s auto@@ imm@@ une diseases , where the body attac@@ ks itself a little too over@@ ze@@ al@@ ously and destro@@ ys the h@@ ost , or the person .
why did we not find some other solution to this ?
it &apos;s unbelie@@ vable .
children : you can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
we had a press conference , we anno@@ un@@ ced our in@@ tent to do one zer@@ o-@@ g par@@ ab@@ ola , give him 25 seconds of zer@@ o-@@ g .
or worse , you let it run until it &apos;s warm to rin@@ se out your to@@ we@@ l .
now they can spend two hours a day and re@@ medi@@ ate , or get up to speed and not feel embar@@ rass@@ ed about what they do or don &apos;t know .
but one of the reasons it &apos;s poli@@ tically hard is there are winn@@ ers and los@@ ers -- not all los@@ ers .
he tra@@ ces the ed@@ ges of the individual networks and then color co@@ des them .
so , we follo@@ wed up . what happened ?
bf : oh , daniel .
kb : oh , they &apos;re gone , ok .
all of you know about the top@@ ic that i &apos;m supposed to talk about .
here &apos;s a little s@@ nap@@ shot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years .
and the top of this mountain range is spli@@ tting apart , creating a ri@@ ft valley .
they were the same people that later went in to medical school , you know , because there was money in it , you know . i mean , later , then they all got into business -- i mean , there are waves of -- going into your high school , person saying , you want to be rich , you know , be a scientist . you know , not anymore .
the reason it has so much color is that it changes using ligh@@ ting .
and these are two proje@@ ctions from the world .
so our engineering students went to work on it , and with some very simple changes , they were able to tri@@ ple the through@@ put of this device .
it &apos;s thi@@ cker , it &apos;s dar@@ ker , it &apos;s co@@ ar@@ ser , it doesn &apos;t have the cont@@ ours .
which allows me , from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall , to have something to occu@@ p@@ y my mind and heart other than my work .
i was able to do more things .
and so it &apos;s really -- it &apos;s really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997 , which is the time of ab@@ ach@@ a -- the military dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship , the worst part of ni@@ geri@@ an history , this post-@@ coloni@@ al history .
bf : he invented the pen@@ cil .
if you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5,000 years ago .
so bios@@ phere 2 was essentially a three-@@ acre , entirely se@@ aled , mini@@ ature world that i lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
over the past couple of days as i &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for my speech , i &apos;ve become more and more nervous about what i &apos;m going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people .
this is us chasing it in the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
and the public is there , and the internet is there , but we have still not used it effectively .
the only reason these people buy touch t@@ one phones is because you can &apos;t buy ro@@ tary phones anymore .
but perhaps more than anything , what this thinking provi@@ des is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design .
and i can &apos;t design that , i can &apos;t plan that , and i can &apos;t even test that .
in the setting of prostate cancer , up to 60 percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence and erec@@ tile dis@@ function .
and we , you know , sort of introduced them to each other .
she agre@@ ed .
even the lo@@ ck@@ set is probably worth 200 dollars .
and that s@@ hir@@ t that i ha@@ dn &apos;t wor@@ n in years ?
but i think it &apos;s time for us to think about what we count .
so here &apos;s one of the bet@@ a units and you can -- it actually turns out to be a really goo@@ d-@@ looking e-@@ book reader .
we think bacteria made the rules for how mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular organization works .
so we look at these sorts of things theore@@ tically , on the basis of genetics , and brain damage , and interaction with environment , and exactly how that machine works .
so , here &apos;s the first story .
for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close en@@ counter@@ s that i had and will describe to you now ?
they write these great symboli@@ c tre@@ a@@ ti@@ ses called books , and pap@@ ers , and op@@ -@@ ed articles .
this is a ta@@ d@@ pole wal@@ ker to take your ta@@ d@@ pole walking in the evening .
what &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equal societies , and see what ine@@ quality does .
and then we can test it out , once we &apos;ve done that , and see how it would move around .
i didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
the exist@@ ential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identi@@ ty is very important .
he clos@@ es it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
according to a very comprehen@@ sive study led by jim coll@@ ins , and docum@@ ented in the book &quot; good to great , &quot; it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goo@@ dness to great@@ ness .
we are doing a thousand now .
so , why is it hot@@ ter in summer than in winter ?
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
and that actually helped a lot .
and on the other hand , it &apos;s a radi@@ cal transformation of the electron@@ ic medical record from a sta@@ tic re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of diagno@@ stic information to a health pro@@ motion tool .
as re@@ moved as we the dominant society may feel from a m@@ ass@@ acre in 18@@ 90 , or a series of broken tre@@ a@@ ties 150 years ago , i still have to ask you the question , how should you feel about the statistics of today ?
and guess what -- they solved the problem .
a re@@ public . a repres@@ ent@@ ative democracy .
and so you see here some early studies of blo@@ cks , where those holes are actually coming through , and this is before the thermo@@ -@@ bi@@ metal is applied , and this is after the bi@@ metal is applied . sorry , it &apos;s a little hard to see , but on the sur@@ faces , you can see these red ar@@ ro@@ ws .
and i &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
and he said , &quot; tony &apos;s in broad@@ mo@@ or . &quot;
let me get you one of our 8@@ ,000 bus@@ es .
and race is an il@@ le@@ giti@@ mate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignor@@ ance .
what happened there ?
the occu@@ p@@ y movement found a voice , and i still have to speak english constantly .
later , she married a fellow migr@@ ant wor@@ ker , moved with him to his village , gave birth to two daugh@@ ters , and sa@@ ved enough money to buy a secon@@ d@@ hand bu@@ i@@ ck for her@@ self and an apart@@ ment for her parents .
par@@ us@@ har@@ am is par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma with a simple beginning but a long way to go .
now why am i talking about co@@ ws ?
the only real difference is that aging kill@@ s consi@@ der@@ ably more people than malaria does .
but i think it could still benefit from more discipl@@ ine .
but all it took was that simple act of no@@ tic@@ ing , and so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
it happened to lots of ma@@ mm@@ als .
so if you &apos;re thinking about sen@@ ding your kid to tin@@ ker@@ ing school , they do come back bru@@ is@@ ed , sc@@ rap@@ ed and bloo@@ dy .
so the human brain , cou@@ pl@@ ed with the human heart , and we join hands around the world .
and then i &apos;ll go to more serious ones .
what is the average age of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans ? 24 .
you can go to the movies and get good se@@ ats .
this has been a really gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zing issue for a long time .
you have to make it from something else .
the public real@@ m comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don &apos;t have the 1,@@ 000-@@ year-old ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l pla@@ z@@ as and market squ@@ ar@@ es of older cultures .
&quot; imagine you run faster than those go@@ ats you are looking after . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening is , we had the yu@@ ck side , but we actually had this real wow side .
it does seem really hard to get consum@@ ers to do the right thing .
str@@ angel@@ y , these re@@ vel@@ ations didn &apos;t cure my low self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em , that feeling of other@@ ness .
i would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration , zit@@ a co@@ b@@ b , the fo@@ under of the wonderful shor@@ e@@ fast foundation , based out of fo@@ go island , new@@ fo@@ und@@ land .
but for me , so is im@@ mi@@ gration .
and he , somehow , has the app@@ reci@@ ation of the values of li@@ ve@@ strong .
got pi@@ cked up in two places in the world : fin@@ land and indones@@ ia .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competi@@ tion to know my sch@@ edu@@ le .
i hope you are too .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m just ap@@ pl@@ ying to pit@@ t for law school . &quot;
so , why is it blue on clou@@ dy days ? ah , see .
just put up ... hands up , people who changed their minds during the debate , who voted differently .
i spent about eight months working on these pro@@ fil@@ es .
this is in the former so@@ vi@@ et union in between ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan and u@@ z@@ be@@ kistan , one of the great in@@ land seas of the world .
and that &apos;s because in middle world , air fri@@ ction is always there .
now , businesses tend to compla@@ in about this , and their , they , i don &apos;t want to take away from their entire v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty of complaining about it , but i did ask a major s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er manufac@@ tur@@ er earlier this year what they thought about pi@@ ra@@ cy , and they told me , &quot; well , you can &apos;t quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , &quot; but they use pi@@ ra@@ cy as market research .
the statistics of bad health are clear , very clear .
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civili@@ zed and evolved .
let me just talk about br@@ ands for a moment , because some of you run br@@ ands . every brand is out there making sound right now .
so today i &apos;m going to take you on a vo@@ y@@ age to c@@ ast light on some of the out@@ dated my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds and as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions that have kept us as the true sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders in the high seas in the dark .
and yet you will see in religious art , sa@@ in@@ ts or the virg@@ in mary will often be portra@@ yed -- not always -- in glam@@ or@@ ous forms .
and we now have 3@@ 50-@@ po@@ und auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
for the first time in years , sh@@ i &apos;@@ ites were allowed to make the pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to k@@ arb@@ ala to ob@@ serve ash@@ ur@@ a , and i was ama@@ zed by the she@@ er number of people and how fer@@ v@@ ently they prac@@ ticed their religion .
every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutri@@ tional value .
for now , let me try to convin@@ ce you of the pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility of this hypo@@ thesis , that it &apos;s actually worth taking seriously .
it &apos;s called ultra@@ -@@ ever dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a super@@ hy@@ drop@@ ho@@ bi@@ c shi@@ el@@ d .
and so it &apos;s incredible the amount of resources we &apos;ve spent keeping our law@@ ns , which are these us@@ eless bi@@ osystems .
this is inside out .
you will have seen something like this -- this is the re@@ verse effect .
thank you .
when the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tour@@ nam@@ ent is over , time stops for len .
why aren &apos;t you ?
they came to me and said , &quot; well , what can we do to fres@@ hen this thing up ?
sex is a place you go . it &apos;s a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
and there were a lot of c@@ ute girls in the sop@@ ran@@ o section , as it turns out .
let me say one last com@@ ment .
there were several other activities .
and we thought , i wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people .
look at some stone tools .
it &apos;ll go this way for sure .
and how do we make these tools , these edi@@ tors , something that are just as fun as the game itself ?
i don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
and so to give you an idea of an analo@@ gy of what i mean by thinking of can@@ cer@@ ing as a ver@@ b , imagine we didn &apos;t know anything about plum@@ bing , and the way that we talked about it , we &apos;d come home and we &apos;d find a lea@@ k in our kitchen and we &apos;d say , &quot; oh , my house has water . &quot;
what &apos;s going to happen in the end , it &apos;s not going to be just humans coloni@@ zing space , it &apos;s going to be life moving out from the earth , moving it into its kingdom . and the kingdom of life , of course , is going to be the universe . and if life is already there , it makes it much more exciting , in the short run .
and having said to your dad , ni@@ ck , that i would try to teach you , i was then slightly conf@@ used as to how i might go about that if i wasn &apos;t allowed near the piano .
let me tell you a secret .
we have lost that re@@ public .
there &apos;s only you in my life ...
look at that . you can &apos;t just make this stuff up , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
right ? that would explain it , right ?
i should em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze , both of these ax@@ es are log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic . as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you &apos;re going up a factor of 10 .
the real questions begin when it comes to argu@@ ing about who deser@@ ves what and why .
and if i tried , i &apos;d dis@@ ap@@ point them .
we know so much about global warming and climate change , and yet , we have no concept of what i &apos;ve been call@@ ing internal environ@@ ment@@ al@@ ism .
and this sequence of neur@@ al ac@@ tivation is hypo@@ thesi@@ zed to be the neur@@ al basis of those sequence of movements .
it &apos;s active in the gulf of guinea .
or some even included refer@@ ences to the speak@@ ers , such as na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old &apos;s speaking style , or the one of ti@@ m fer@@ ris@@ s , which might be consi@@ dered a bit stren@@ u@@ ous at times .
he allowed facebook , a u.@@ s@@ .-@@ based service , to continue to stay on inside of tun@@ isi@@ a .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s bad , but i told him , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with a chinese woman ? &quot;
and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
now , why do i say that ?
but when i say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehi@@ cles . they think about cars and motor@@ cy@@ cles and bi@@ cy@@ cles , and the vehi@@ cles that you use every day .
we only remember what we want to . at least i do .
and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the re@@ bo@@ und , the economic re@@ bo@@ und , not just in asia , but potenti@@ ally for the world .
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
so , you know , a little bad -- sorry , sorry , sorry .
and now we designed them reason@@ ably well , but that &apos;s exactly why they are la@@ sting that long and still provi@@ ding all the science data .
one of them told me , &quot; paul , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ist idea .
and as i said before , i &apos;ll end with something that &apos;s car@@ ved above the door of the car@@ ne@@ gie library .
and the in@@ struc@@ tor was up there in the class expla@@ ining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identi@@ ty in this new age .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than r@@ ural , environments .
there is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen -- that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
a lot of people say now that business will li@@ ft up the developing econom@@ ies , and social business will take care of the rest .
and i am not a complete pac@@ i@@ f@@ ist like some of my really , really hea@@ v@@ y-@@ du@@ ty , non-@@ violent friends , like mai@@ read mc@@ gu@@ ire .
when i was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
let &apos;s have our cars go at 60 miles per hour .
and we also put a page on facebook for the sing@@ ers to up@@ load their te@@ stim@@ oni@@ als , what it was like for them , their experience sing@@ ing it .
and what &apos;s the second most important thing after integri@@ ty ?
j@@ .@@ j@@ . from &quot; good times , &quot; significant to many people of course because of &quot; d@@ y-@@ no@@ -@@ mi@@ te , &quot; but perhaps more significant as the first , really , black artist on pri@@ me@@ time tv .
mars is half the size of the earth , but because two-@@ thirds of the earth is covered by water , the land area on mars is compar@@ able to the land area on earth .
if you close your eyes right now in this room , you &apos;re aware of the size of the room from the re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ation and the boun@@ cing of the sound off the sur@@ faces .
and you can see , it &apos;s kind of poll@@ in@@ ating , ger@@ min@@ ating , growing .
el@@ iz@@ ab@@ eth : bit@@ ch !
because now , with this idea we can take a random s@@ ample of people , have them nom@@ in@@ ate their friends , those friends would be more central , and we could do this without having to map the network .
and if they do that all at once , it &apos;s like playing po@@ ker and going all in right away .
and how come you ain &apos;t got a job anyway ?
but the small stuff , what you might call the user interface , is done spec@@ tac@@ ularly b@@ adly .
and actually , it &apos;s the model that we expect to work for deli@@ ver@@ ing anes@@ thes@@ ia in these environments .
and this is what we &apos;ve lost in afghanistan and iraq .
the question now is , well , who are we ?
these stat@@ ues , mar@@ vel@@ ous stat@@ ues , gives you an idea of water table .
and then talking about ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy -- des@@ per@@ ately important .
very speci@@ alized material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ assem@@ bles , millions of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year .
so i did . that &apos;s paris .
here we see a female cra@@ w@@ ling out of the ocean under mo@@ on@@ light on the island of tr@@ ini@@ dad .
i know you &apos;re there because i can hear you , but i can &apos;t see you because i norm@@ ally wear gl@@ asses .
you can also comp@@ ress that into a building block , as they did here .
so here &apos;s our c@@ unning experim@@ enter .
thank you very much .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is the r@@ hi@@ zo@@ car@@ p@@ on geo@@ graphi@@ c@@ um , or map lichen , and this is around 3@@ ,000 years old and lives in green@@ land , which is a long way to go for some lich@@ ens .
but i think from the point of view of a ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al , there would have been a lot of dis@@ appro@@ val of the wi@@ mp@@ ish ch@@ op@@ pers that we now have .
david rock@@ well : a memor@@ ial at ground zero
girls out@@ per@@ form boys now at every level , from element@@ ary school to gradu@@ ate school .
so , let &apos;s pull back from the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es for a second and look at our society from high above .
i don &apos;t know how you feel , but i like to co@@ ok for enter@@ tainment .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
it is bar@@ ely te@@ ther@@ ed to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
she says this to me .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the ben@@ ch .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
but this dog cancer is quite remarkable , because it spread all around the world .
it &apos;s not this , right ? it &apos;s not a child &apos;s to@@ y .
after this , we noticed a couple of interesting things , which you &apos;ll see .
we wanted to do a team which was so re@@ moved from the way we &apos;d done it , that i only had a phone number that connected me to them .
and i realized that this wasn &apos;t just my life .
it &apos;s a win@@ -@@ win trade : i give you ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us , and you feed me .
we &apos;ve also found an un@@ intended con@@ sequence .
so here we have a bunch of stuff , some images .
this is ice water on mars .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
someone is re-@@ engineering dinosau@@ r@@ s by extra@@ cting their dna from pre@@ histor@@ ic am@@ ber .
our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain l@@ ur@@ king on planet earth , but to spread out into space .
and often they &apos;re the most vulnerable element of all .
when the industrial revolution started , the amount of carbon sitting underneath bri@@ tain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under sau@@ di arab@@ ia in the form of oil , and this carbon powered the industrial revolution , it put the &quot; great &quot; in great bri@@ tain , and led to bri@@ tain &apos;s temporary world dom@@ ination .
one of the thre@@ ads that seems to have come through lou@@ d and clear in the last couple of days is this need to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le what the big wants -- the &quot; big &quot; being the organization , the system , the country -- and what the &quot; small &quot; wants -- the individual , the person .
and the example he used was coffee .
so there &apos;s this bat@@ tle between the two selves that &apos;s being f@@ ought , and we need commit@@ ment devices to level the playing field between the two .
indeed , they do look very strange . we &apos;re humans .
in fail@@ ing states , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ dal states , under@@ -@@ gover@@ ned states , precisely the kinds of places that thre@@ ats to this country exist on the hori@@ zon , and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world &apos;s suffering ten@@ ds to get concent@@ rated .
but the cent@@ er@@ piece species of z@@ ak@@ ou@@ ma are the eleph@@ ants .
we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clin@@ ics .
because of this acceler@@ ated pace of de@@ stru@@ ction , it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to acceler@@ ate our work .
it wasn &apos;t fer@@ ris bu@@ eller . and for@@ give me mat@@ the@@ w bro@@ deri@@ ck , i know you &apos;ve done other movies besi@@ des fer@@ ris bu@@ eller , but that &apos;s how i remember you ; you &apos;re fer@@ ris .
but it &apos;s one that i think we need to learn from .
and he takes this one .
take the first step , as soon as life appeared on this earth .
software can do it faster .
now , it &apos;s hard to do . it &apos;s hard to translate a fish form , because they &apos;re so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this .
nuclear power , to get 16 light bul@@ bs per person , you &apos;d need two gi@@ ga@@ watts at each of the pur@@ ple dots on the map .
somebody was hit@@ ting somebody else with br@@ ass k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and this is where it gets interesting for for@@ en@@ si@@ cs .
and then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all , you just get this empty bed .
and the way i look at it is : if you don &apos;t have kni@@ ves and for@@ ks in your school , you &apos;re pur@@ ely end@@ or@@ sing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s hand@@ held .
t@@ j : it has to be companies . it has to be civil society .
somebody in the audience asked me , &quot; how does he breathe up there ? &quot;
the second thing you need is light .
and the very un@@ sa@@ tis@@ fying , yet scientific , answer is it &apos;s too hard .
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ri@@ de from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely aw@@ ful movie called &quot; medicine ball car@@ a@@ van . &quot;
when they &apos;re out of education , they do it on a computer .
see , when you get close they &apos;re really just blo@@ bs of paint .
we could not possibly stay indo@@ ors , with all these sand@@ bag@@ s at the windows .
it &apos;s very complicated to explain .
&quot; there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
i want to say that it is important to recognize that africa has fundamental we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses .
first of all , for exc@@ ep@@ tions , there are a lot of them and they &apos;re important .
what i do with my kids now -- i &apos;ve got two , nine and seven -- is i teach them to walk around the house and the y@@ ard , looking for stuff that needs to get done .
for me , the human voice is the ves@@ sel on which all emo@@ tions travel -- except perhaps je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
and when kar@@ a@@ j@@ an is asked about it he actually says , &quot; yes , the worst damage i can do to my or@@ che@@ str@@ a is to give them a clear instru@@ ction .
so after traveling and talking to people in places like o@@ kla@@ hom@@ a or sm@@ all-@@ town texas , we found evidence that the initial pre@@ mis@@ e was dead on .
we squ@@ ash@@ ed it , we re@@ thought it , but main@@ ly we ren@@ am@@ ed it &quot; the heart of school , &quot; and that changed everything for@@ ever .
it &apos;s better if you care about learning something .
and they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of development .
because there &apos;s a lot of money in sand@@ al@@ wo@@ ods .
i have cancer .
and i know 200 , i know about the small data .
but in the 197@@ 0s , some countries caught up .
the hei@@ ght is how long it took them .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
what came out of it ?
what ever happened to the small hadron collider ?
but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and tru@@ cks would ever be in conflict with nature .
we t@@ weak that a lot .
if those people had voted for obama , even half of them , obama would have won lou@@ isi@@ ana sa@@ f@@ ely .
time is scar@@ ce , so what do we do ?
nothing is more n@@ ourishing , more stim@@ ulating to an active , in@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing mind than being surprised , being ama@@ zed . it &apos;s why we &apos;re all here at ted , right ?
it is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
at that point , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s possible at all .
it &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanot@@ u@@ be .
at the 2008 e@@ g conference , fam@@ ed puzzle designer scot@@ t k@@ im takes us inside the puzz@@ le-@@ maker &apos;s frame of mind . sam@@ pl@@ ing his career &apos;s work , he introdu@@ ces a few of the most popular types , and shar@@ es the fascin@@ ations that inspired some of his best .
and it is a sort of race , and each and every animal is different , and the winning co@@ des will multi@@ p@@ ly .
best dan@@ cer wal@@ ks t@@ all , gets the best date .
and these are our th@@ ai tu@@ li@@ ps .
every year or so , i have the privi@@ lege of taking cl@@ ini@@ cians into the himala@@ y@@ as and the ti@@ bet@@ an plat@@ e@@ au .
they &apos;re very , very sti@@ ff . they stre@@ tch very , very little .
do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benef@@ ited from computers and ma@@ ths have somehow conc@@ ep@@ tu@@ ally gotten redu@@ ced by using computers ?
it was that human connection that charles and ray always found in everything .
this is not a fi@@ ve-@@ minute pit@@ ch . this is , you know , two sent@@ ences .
this is u@@ ce .
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the ri@@ ver@@ side church while i was a pa@@ stor , and he invi@@ ted repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of faith tradi@@ tions from all around the world .
we have never had as many means of communication , means of being connected , means of re@@ aching out , means of including .
and mean@@ while , i use non@@ sense , as you can see .
if you had 100 million people proper@@ ly spread out , then if there &apos;s some g@@ arb@@ age , you th@@ row it away , pre@@ fer@@ ably where you can &apos;t see it , and it will rot .
you &apos;re driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
they actually have these bus@@ es that drive up and over the lat@@ er@@ al mor@@ a@@ ine and drop people off on the surface of the glac@@ ier .
and mean@@ while , besi@@ des all the spiritu@@ ality , there was one m@@ un@@ dan@@ e detail in the ka@@ ab@@ a that was pretty interesting for me .
darwin thought that a@@ thei@@ sm might be well and good for the intelligent@@ si@@ a , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ri@@ pe for it . &quot;
i think that &apos;s wrong , but -- i think it &apos;s right for argu@@ ment@@ ation . right ?
one of my clos@@ est friends , o@@ kol@@ oma , died in a plane crash because our fire tru@@ cks did not have water .
my kind of eu@@ re@@ ka moment came a few years later , when i was studying the art of the cour@@ ts of northern europe , and of course it was very much disc@@ ussed in terms of the paintings and the sculp@@ tures and the architecture of the day .
my dad left a small village outside of am@@ ri@@ t@@ sa@@ r , india .
the key to survi@@ ving a nuclear bl@@ ast is getting out , and not going into har@@ m &apos;s way .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
there &apos;s another thing happening around the country , which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water foot@@ print .
we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the mini@@ stry of health in r@@ wand@@ a and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
now the great advantage of this histor@@ ical experience has been that , without the han , china could never have held together .
so , are these things , how are these things getting here ?
cover@@ ing the tra@@ gic tun@@ e with something different , something radi@@ cally different .
he had the fa@@ vor of god with him .
it &apos;s a remarkable example of two different prie@@ stly appro@@ pri@@ ations of the same event , two different religious ta@@ ke@@ over@@ s of a political fact .
we don &apos;t want to go blind because there &apos;s too many possi@@ bilities , and there is not too much lab , and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .
what &apos;s next : antar@@ c@@ tica .
one is the rise toward communities and neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , and increased em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on your neighbor@@ s as your support system .
and it &apos;s been trans@@ l@@ ated into 26 languages .
that &apos;s the old way , that &apos;s the old man@@ tra : one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen .
under the c@@ ot@@ on@@ o@@ u agre@@ ement , for@@ mer@@ ly known as the l@@ ome conven@@ tion , african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to exp@@ ort goo@@ ds , du@@ ty-@@ free , to the european union market .
the yellow line shows us the most likely path .
but i want you to realize that resources in the hands of african women is a powerful tool .
and you can &apos;t tell .
because so@@ on@@ er or later , we &apos;ll be con@@ fron@@ ted with decisions about this , and it &apos;s better if we think hard about it , even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it .
but you &apos;ve got to -- yeah , well up until then every building le@@ ak@@ ed , so this ...
it doesn &apos;t really matter . it &apos;s the same mos@@ qui@@ to , and it &apos;s the same disease . you &apos;re at risk .
they were si@@ len@@ ced by an unfortunate accident of history .
certainly when i &apos;m traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let &apos;s say , a hal@@ f-@@ kore@@ an , hal@@ f-@@ german young woman living in paris .
it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thri@@ ve in this life .
that became , as it were , a way of con@@ fron@@ ting large businesses in the business of wa@@ sting food , and ex@@ pos@@ ing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thro@@ wn away , stuff that &apos;s beyond the p@@ ale .
imagine that whale listening from 500 miles .
e : ach@@ o@@ o !
and i didn &apos;t give the talk always . you did , and we had to watch you , and so forth .
something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our life@@ time .
all value is percei@@ ved value .
i was born un@@ able to see most colors .
this change has contribu@@ ted to the vi@@ tality and the whole economy .
now , that is difficult .
and he said , &quot; when i got to the sen@@ ior year of school , my teachers didn &apos;t take it seriously .
and he sp@@ ends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is .
this fis@@ h@@ ing village was famous for sculp@@ ture .
there are something like 500 high school chap@@ ters de@@ voted to stopp@@ ing the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in dar@@ fu@@ r .
the magic question is , &quot; what for ? &quot;
so , we have actually -- are looking to turn the x prize into a world-@@ class prize institute .
i worry that my children have ha@@ te in their hear@@ ts , and when they want to grow up , they want to fight again the kill@@ ers of their father and their brother . &quot;
mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ al dna , tra@@ cing a pur@@ ely mat@@ ern@@ al line of des@@ cent .
think about your own work .
now , re-@@ wil@@ ding is moving faster in korea than it is in america , and so the plan is , with these re-@@ wil@@ ded areas all over europe , they will introduce the au@@ ro@@ chs to do its old job , its old ec@@ ological role , of clear@@ ing the some@@ what bar@@ ren , clos@@ e@@ d-@@ can@@ op@@ y forest so that it has these bio@@ di@@ verse me@@ a@@ do@@ ws in it .
and i couldn &apos;t for@@ give myself for the coun@@ tless , coun@@ tless hours i had lost in negative thought -- all the time i had spent be@@ ating myself up for los@@ ing my marri@@ age and not stopp@@ ing the sexual ab@@ use when i was a kid and career moves and this and this and this .
a transi@@ stor is nothing more than a wall switch .
and they said , &quot; well let &apos;s work on new@@ born ja@@ un@@ di@@ ce . &quot;
so while s@@ ally , the office manag@@ er , was teaching me to speak in the day -- it &apos;s hard , because when you &apos;re a kid , you take things for gran@@ ted .
you know tom frie@@ d@@ man says , &quot; if you don &apos;t go , you don &apos;t know &quot; ?
two years ago the migr@@ ating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation oc@@ curr@@ ing in the virus , which made the species range bro@@ aden drama@@ tically .
so when you saw him make a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous ed@@ it to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to de@@ generate into ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h .
but let &apos;s stick first to tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis .
we de-@@ lin@@ ked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
this got us very excited .
i ass@@ ure you , this is very tiny . it &apos;s just six mic@@ r@@ ons on a side .
i have a solution that requ@@ ires nei@@ ther machine , n@@ or wood , n@@ or cooking gas .
well , you &apos;ve got to stand outside to do this .
and here &apos;s the opportunity .
so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors , on how they looked like , how they beha@@ ved , was kind of bi@@ as@@ ed toward adul@@ ts .
and when you &apos;re lost in information , an information map is kind of useful .
that &apos;s mars from the european mars expres@@ s , and at new year .
and i &apos;m going to tell you that story here in a moment .
this picture is the hall@@ mark of cen@@ sor@@ ship in the book record .
nobody knows where they are .
and if i go down and look at ni@@ ger , where there was such a terrible fam@@ ine , la@@ stly , it &apos;s like this . the 20 percent poor@@ est of ni@@ ger is out here , and the 20 percent rich@@ est of south africa is there , and yet we tend to disc@@ uss on what solutions there should be in africa .
treating people as machines may be scienti@@ fically and philosop@@ hi@@ cally accurate , but it &apos;s a cum@@ ber@@ some waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
the crazy teacher -- that &apos;s me on the left , i d@@ ress up pretty , thank you , my wife , i love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate bor@@ ough president and a guy named george ir@@ win from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this pat@@ ented technology .
jason started at dar@@ pa on mar@@ ch 18@@ th , 2010 .
they only live a few days .
you can imagine that if he p@@ ush@@ ed the rock on different h@@ ills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by lu@@ dwi@@ g b@@ ol@@ tz@@ mann , an au@@ stri@@ an physicist in the 19@@ th century .
my main message is that progress in technology is expon@@ ential , not line@@ ar .
i was asked to come here and speak about creation .
but this is it .
but the ants do , and we &apos;ll figure out why , so that ultimately we &apos;ll make this move . and imagine : you &apos;re going to be able to have s@@ war@@ ms of these si@@ x-@@ milli@@ meter robots available to run around .
so every gra@@ in of sand is unique . every beach is different .
now it &apos;s also very hard to intu@@ it these results . think about it for yourself .
there was no separ@@ ation of sex@@ es .
there &apos;s wat@@ ches coming out that will measure your heart rate , the ze@@ o sleep monit@@ ors , a whole su@@ ite of tools that can en@@ able you to le@@ verage and have insi@@ ght into your own health .
think about it . if you were an engine@@ er and i told you that you had to build an autom@@ o@@ bile , but it had to start off to be this big , then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .
he ble@@ e@@ ds out p@@ ig@@ s .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electron@@ ic j@@ ell@@ yfish .
by a show of hands , were you right ?
let me show you what this looks like .
the red dots are the children we have not treated .
and everything &apos;s autom@@ ated at the other end .
the institute of medicine tried to look at the m@@ asking question .
it looked the same , but it had a different orig@@ in , it was a different art@@ work .
it was the early &apos; 90s , and i was at a public event .
and they do wonderful things .
she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .
not so if you &apos;re adop@@ ting a religious min@@ d@@ set .
so even though i have a fear of hei@@ ghts , i recently str@@ apped myself to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an air@@ plane at 12@@ ,000 ft .
same idea : series of se@@ mi@@ -@@ independent cit@@ y-@@ states , little blo@@ bs of me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan stuff with ar@@ able land around , joined to one another by ra@@ il@@ way .
they said , &quot; absolutely fine , provided you get planning per@@ mission and you do it in latin and you do it in tri@@ p@@ licate , &quot; so we did — — and now there are fru@@ it trees and bus@@ hes and her@@ bs and vege@@ tables around that doctor &apos;s surgery .
again , imagine those all back and forth there .
and this meant that i was a libr@@ a ?
they tra@@ ined the escape refle@@ x that makes the fly jum@@ p into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position .
so i really think it &apos;s a less@@ on that we &apos;re actually learning from them .
we &apos;ve been talking at this conference about african success stories .
and over the years , as we follo@@ wed da@@ i man@@ j@@ u , we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vi@@ cious cycle and into a virtu@@ ous cycle .
this is very , very exciting .
this is something we &apos;ve fac@@ ed several times over the last few cent@@ uries .
watch . one , two , a one , two , three , four .
the one bat@@ tle that the sp@@ art@@ ans f@@ ought that everybody remem@@ bers is the the bat@@ tle of ther@@ m@@ op@@ y@@ la@@ e where they were bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed to a man , but f@@ ought for the freedom of gre@@ e@@ ce . &quot;
we start from dood@@ les and sk@@ et@@ ches .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
and this would be a hotel .
and for that they have to be able to access stat@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ art markets .
but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin .
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
and when they touched the s@@ na@@ ke everything was fine . they were cu@@ red .
the key physics princi@@ ple here is when water bo@@ ils to steam it exp@@ ands by a factor of 1,@@ 600 .
it was a big co@@ inci@@ dence .
so safety , with respect to the appli@@ cation , this is the number one answer that we get from gro@@ wers , why biological control .
this is the guy who started the project in my lab , and this is the guy who &apos;s been doing prostate stuff .
this is a re@@ al-@@ time map that shows blo@@ cked ro@@ ads , dama@@ ged buildings , refuge@@ e camp@@ s -- it shows things that are needed &#91; for res@@ cue and rel@@ ie@@ f work &#93; .
let me just give you two examples .
let us re@@ call the pion@@ e@@ ers who made this technical mar@@ vel possible .
and in a mes@@ h , every device contribu@@ tes to and exp@@ ands the network , and i think you might have heard a little bit about it before .
the wireless institute , the west wireless health institute , is really the out@@ growth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening : g@@ ary and mary west . and i &apos;d like to give it up for them for getting behind this .
and that &apos;s the good news i have . we can do that .
so they figu@@ red not being able to see is one thing , but they need to get me to talk .
because it worked .
you take 10 kilo@@ grams of feed , you can get one kilo@@ gram of bee@@ f , but you can get nine kilo@@ grams of lo@@ c@@ ust meat .
secon@@ dar@@ ily , we wanted to see if we could exp@@ ort this dri@@ p irri@@ gation and bring it into other countries .
second , security . third , relationships .
the thing is , there &apos;s something in these lab@@ s that they have to offer society that you can &apos;t find anywhere else .
it was just , &quot; because i say so .
d@@ han@@ i jones , who is the middle line@@ bac@@ ker for the cin@@ c@@ inn@@ at@@ i ben@@ g@@ als , has a slightly different approach to the off@@ -@@ seas@@ on .
listen to these tit@@ les of some of the best@@ selling books from both sides of the political divide here in the u.s .
certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to de@@ va@@ state the place , turning everything that will bur@@ n into heat , or drin@@ k the water that &apos;s available .
so he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things .
that is a point that is not coming out from the bi@@ ble , but it &apos;s something that really ac@@ compani@@ ed humanity .
only one week -- one week try and not a single day more .
okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot mis@@ ha .
i &apos;m now going to ask you to do the task , but now with a little more challenging task . there are going to be three of them that are blue . don &apos;t move your eyes .
don &apos;t we already know how they affect temper@@ atures ?
the final st@@ ages , when i ran the sam@@ ples through a high-@@ pressure li@@ qu@@ id chro@@ mat@@ o@@ graphy mass spec@@ tro@@ meter , which separated the com@@ pounds and analy@@ zed the che@@ mic@@ als and told me exactly how much car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens i had in my chicken .
these were the low-@@ tech appro@@ a@@ ches to the high-@@ tech conver@@ sa@@ tions i was having .
the chinese word for &quot; bat &quot; sounds like the chinese word for &quot; happiness , &quot; and they believe that bat@@ s bring wealth , health , lon@@ ge@@ vity , virtu@@ e and ser@@ en@@ ity .
&quot; sh@@ ush , watch this . &quot;
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
now , home@@ town security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; char@@ ity beg@@ ins at home . &quot;
and i &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formul@@ a ; someone else knows how to work the formul@@ a better than me , so i won &apos;t talk about it .
liber@@ ation , however , co@@ sts some money .
i am origin@@ ally from j@@ or@@ dan .
so , i am a jun@@ gi@@ an psycho@@ analy@@ st , and i went to afghanistan in janu@@ ary 200@@ 4 , by chance , on an assi@@ gn@@ ment for medi@@ ca mon@@ di@@ ale .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the head@@ lines of the newsp@@ ap@@ ers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
my saying was going to be , &quot; i &apos;m taking out the tr@@ ash ! &quot;
i &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ dness expres@@ sed to me .
the place was falling apart ; it was a horrible , horrible place , and i needed to go and explore the center of kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a to report on the ri@@ ot@@ ing and the lo@@ ot@@ ing .
we all have to be included .
those who were intended to recei@@ ve the data , 7@@ 4 percent of them received it .
&quot; know thy@@ self . &quot;
that &apos;s very surprising to me . &quot; and those are science gradu@@ ates .
and i can -- in 15 minutes , i think i can touch only a very rather jan@@ it@@ ori@@ al bran@@ ch of creation , which i call &quot; creativity . &quot;
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emis@@ sion redu@@ ctions of three percent per year to re@@ store planet@@ ary energy balance and stabili@@ ze climate this century .
students l@@ ack per@@ sever@@ ance .
we use them metap@@ hor@@ ically -- the dna of a company , the metaboli@@ sm of a city , and so on -- is that just bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it , metap@@ hor@@ ical bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it , or is there serious substance to it ?
the first thing you do is lock into a ti@@ ght body position -- head down in your ch@@ est , your arms ex@@ tended , put over your reser@@ ve par@@ ach@@ ute .
comp@@ ul@@ sive gam@@ bl@@ ers are exper@@ ts at self-@@ dec@@ eption .
it &apos;s covered with a cro@@ ch@@ et@@ ed ne@@ tting that is embedded with mush@@ room spor@@ es .
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i &apos;ll tell you about .
and when he then wal@@ ks back to the media lab , he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he &apos;s taken , sort through them and organi@@ ze them , and re-@@ size them , etc . , again using all natural gest@@ ures .
so 37 is our target audience .
this is an example of the kind of graphi@@ cs you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today .
i want to tell you that .
but it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
and it &apos;ll be on these questions : where did i come from ? why am i here ? where am i going ?
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the per@@ mi@@ an , 250 million years ago , a com@@ et hit us .
j oh , come on . there must be some .
my doctor told me that in order to he@@ al my brain , i had to rest it .
and nobody was listening then , but now people are beginning to listen because there &apos;s a pres@@ sing , technological problem that we face .
now when the third group came in , they were told that their ana@@ grams and their mark@@ ers had been ch@@ osen by their mothers .
artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult .
how about some x pri@@ zes for ocean explor@@ ation ?
it &apos;s basically efficient brain@@ stor@@ ming , and when i vis@@ ited david to learn about his research , he used dan@@ c@@ ers to explain it to me rather than the usual me@@ thod : powerpoint .
so it becomes quite rational to den@@ y services to in@@ je@@ ctors .
so , you &apos;ve got to take me through like a six@@ th gra@@ der -- du@@ b , du@@ b , du@@ b , du@@ b , du@@ b -- but without pat@@ r@@ oni@@ zing me .
and that law was called the audio home recording act of 199@@ 2 .
on one particular oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on , one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds thre@@ w a gren@@ ade into the prison@@ ers &apos; la@@ v@@ atory while it was full of prison@@ ers .
he said , &quot; if i keep t@@ os@@ sing myself off i get fres@@ h sper@@ m being made . &quot;
and let me show you what happened .
those holes you see there are very fil@@ ter@@ e@@ d-@@ down , water@@ e@@ d-@@ down versions of the extrem@@ ity of the di@@ atom@@ ic structures .
this could be even more powerful if you look at ma@@ mm@@ als that are doing things slightly differently .
and for the people who were there running the gang , it was a great way , seem@@ ingly , to make a lot of money .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive . i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive .
and again , i get that feeling when we get a kno@@ ck on the door of our apart@@ ment in brooklyn , and my sister and i find a deli@@ ver@@ y@@ man with a box of pi@@ zz@@ a that we didn &apos;t order .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , he met this guy , who is ro@@ dri@@ go bag@@ gi@@ o , the ow@@ ner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil .
the r@@ ural poor had become the urban poor , and in the process , they &apos;d become invisible .
and now , you &apos;ve got to w@@ ra@@ p it up and tie it up here .
when i was at coun@@ cil of scientific industry research -- 40 labor@@ at@@ ories -- when two labor@@ at@@ ories were not talking to each other , i would &#91; unclear &#93; .
b@@ r : and we &apos;re che@@ fs . so when mo@@ to open@@ ed in 200@@ 4 , people didn &apos;t really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the lo@@ go , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requ@@ est@@ s for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousand@@ th request for a ma@@ k@@ i roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of prin@@ ted food , and this was the first for@@ ay into what we like to call fla@@ vor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the fla@@ vor of , you know , a standard ma@@ k@@ i roll , prin@@ ted onto a little piece of paper .
he was the one that stopped those ab@@ uses you saw , because when he saw those images , he turned them over to a sen@@ ior investi@@ g@@ ating off@@ ic@@ er .
it &apos;s actually scary . it &apos;s beautiful .
but dis@@ ney world is wonder@@ fully true to itself .
and since we are in a medical room , i went through four and a half months of chem@@ o .
and we can scale this model .
bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
an inno@@ v@@ ator is one who does not know it cannot be done .
and , remark@@ ably , that moment got caught on film by photo@@ grapher mark ri@@ char@@ ds , who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together .
so sti@@ cker pri@@ ces will ultimately fall to about the same as today , while the driving cost , even from the start , is very much lower .
i mean , you see , everything seems to have been sc@@ at@@ tered a@@ im@@ less@@ ly around the space .
so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
and more about &quot; if i &apos;ve got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can i do to benefit other people ? &quot;
or when you over@@ eat because your feelings are hur@@ t , or whatever .
one way of descri@@ bing the plu@@ to@@ cr@@ ats is as al@@ ph@@ a ge@@ e@@ ks , and they are people who are acu@@ tely aware of how important highly sop@@ hi@@ sticated analy@@ tical and quanti@@ ta@@ tive skills are in today &apos;s economy .
fis@@ h@@ net sto@@ ck@@ ings .
nar@@ ration : &quot; for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful@@ ness . &quot;
they &apos;re of a new nature : they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an ar@@ med strug@@ gle .
this has actually been , to me , a gi@@ ft , because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life .
but then we actually don &apos;t know that it &apos;s all out .
this led me to blood .
they &apos;re collabor@@ ative , they &apos;re brand@@ ed , they &apos;re mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional , and they &apos;re highly discipl@@ ined .
or it was last year .
the man impor@@ ted all the materials from japan , and he hi@@ red a japanese car@@ p@@ enter to build it in the traditional style .
i heard cul@@ tur@@ ally and because of the law , they would just ar@@ rest us at the first pa@@ sting .
thanks to a really boring lec@@ ture , i started car@@ ic@@ atur@@ ing my teachers in school .
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
so when her collea@@ gue said , &quot; what does he do ? &quot;
so , working with b@@ ent@@ ley and micro@@ station , we &apos;ve written a cu@@ st@@ om piece of software that networks all of the comp@@ on@@ ents together into these ch@@ un@@ ks of information , so that if we change any element along the l@@ ength of the building , not only does that change distribu@@ te through each one of the tr@@ us@@ ses , but each one of the tr@@ us@@ ses then distribu@@ tes that information down the l@@ ength of the entire fac@@ ade of the building .
when they point right back , the horse is fe@@ ar@@ ful or angry , depen@@ ding upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
so we &apos;ve talked a lot about fac@@ ial appe@@ ar@@ ance .
thanks .
br@@ un@@ o , do you want to join us ?
but then we ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate on what they &apos;re going to get paid .
but evolu@@ tion@@ arily , two million years is nothing .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
&quot; strange , &quot; i said .
so , in fact , our pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion is going to par@@ li@@ am@@ ent next month .
now , that was before cas@@ se@@ tte tap@@ es , c@@ .@@ d@@ .@@ s , d@@ v@@ ds -- any of the cool stuff we &apos;ve got now .
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces .
we have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us , and i think if we could get kids to embra@@ ce the idea at a young age of being entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al , we could change everything in the world that is a problem today .
she stands vis@@ -@@ a-@@ v@@ is in front of the victi@@ m at the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , ben@@ ding its ab@@ dom@@ en and in@@ ser@@ ting a single eg@@ g , a single eg@@ g into the body flu@@ ids of the ap@@ hi@@ d .
the new me is beauty .
and this third kind of vision , of something which can be , which may be , based on knowledge , but is as yet un@@ pro@@ ven .
and this is how the tam@@ per@@ -@@ pro@@ of drug industry was invented .
after 10 days , i made the decision to return to my body , and the internal ble@@ e@@ ding stopped .
and bl@@ ess yourself . thank you very much .
and i &apos;ve always been nervous about the term &quot; fu@@ tur@@ ist , &quot; because you seem do@@ om@@ ed to failure because you can &apos;t really predict it .
at the office , most of the inter@@ rup@@ tions and di@@ stra@@ ctions that really cause people not to get work done are invol@@ un@@ tary .
except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
i had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important .
let &apos;s go back to traditional far@@ ming .
so back to back takes si@@ te@@ -@@ specific theater and uses it to g@@ ently re@@ mind us about who and what we choose to ed@@ it out of our daily lives .
civili@@ zations and cultures , which had been ignor@@ ed , which had no voice , which were not listen@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of repres@@ entation in this world .
but for the most part , we &apos;ve gone from sal@@ ting to ex@@ hau@@ sting .
so this one is like a sound board , so you can touch it , and i just love these horrible no@@ ises .
thank you .
now , this techni@@ que has been tried on do@@ zens of patients by other groups in hel@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may prove to be valu@@ able as a treatment for phan@@ tom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stro@@ ke rehabilitation .
i used a little t@@ wee@@ zer which i made from a hair clip .
and i &apos;d ask all of you , when you leave here , please just share , and keep the ideas that you &apos;ve gotten out of here going , because it can make a difference .
so the adop@@ tion pap@@ ers were signed .
do you realize that you , ted users , spend an average of 5@@ 2 minutes per day in traffic , wa@@ sting your time on your daily com@@ mu@@ te ?
so the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
i start 50 years ago when africa cele@@ br@@ ated indepen@@ dence in most countries .
in fact , we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanze@@ es would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the ter@@ mit@@ es and the same rocks to cra@@ ck open the nu@@ ts .
or i &apos;d make eye cont@@ act with everyone -- that was really cre@@ ep@@ y ; that didn &apos;t work at all .
and then the bro@@ ader ideas of cit@@ y-@@ making start having dire@@ ct influ@@ ences on architecture , on the elements that make up the bro@@ ader sche@@ me , the buildings themselves , and start gui@@ ding us .
all@@ an mc@@ rob@@ ie is a bridge engine@@ er from cambridge who wrote to me , suggesting that a bridge si@@ mul@@ ator ought to wo@@ b@@ ble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pen@@ d@@ ul@@ ums of exactly the right l@@ ength .
google co-@@ fo@@ under@@ s lar@@ ry page and ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in offer a pe@@ ek inside the google machine , sharing ti@@ d@@ bits about international search patterns , the phil@@ anth@@ ro@@ pi@@ c google foundation , and the company &apos;s de@@ di@@ cation to innovation and employe@@ e happiness .
i think it ad@@ ds a huge amount .
and the size of the room is not that big .
it &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
and this , let me tell you , is very good for the bottom line .
he &apos;d come up from tru@@ man@@ s@@ bur@@ g to teach me not just about the mo@@ o@@ g synthesi@@ zer , but we &apos;d be sitting there -- i &apos;m studying physics at the time . this is 196@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 .
what it means is the web is going to become an exciting place again .
for me that &apos;s winning , regar@@ d@@ less of all the deta@@ ils .
we don &apos;t understand the code used by the brain .
that signal was so strong , it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water bu@@ ried in the se@@ di@@ ment , collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of astero@@ ids and com@@ et material .
i mean , people like bill bu@@ x@@ ton have been playing around with it in the &apos; 80s .
and then i signed a book contra@@ ct to write more glo@@ om@@ y thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the pla@@ gue , and you know , nuclear bom@@ bs explo@@ ding in new york where i would be within the circle , and so on .
look at the industry for self-@@ image and the jobs it creates , the re@@ venue it turns over .
we &apos;re har@@ ming ourselves around the world , as well as har@@ ming the animals , as well as har@@ ming nature her@@ self -- mother nature , that brought us into being ; mother nature , where i believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psych@@ ological development .
these dia@@ grams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gas@@ es -- a lot of those studies inclu@@ de , &quot; well of course war will be ine@@ vi@@ table and therefore we &apos;ll have cities bur@@ ning and stuff like that , &quot; which is kind of fin@@ ess@@ ing it a little bit , i think .
when the tur@@ bine drop@@ s in , it will produce 8@@ ,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and we started a studio .
quot@@ ing from my wri@@ tings : &quot; my two class@@ mates , re@@ bel and val , and i had made the date to meet in the law school library on fri@@ day night to work on our mem@@ o assi@@ gn@@ ment together .
well , i was a gro@@ wn man who had all of these ritu@@ als , and it got so there was a th@@ rob@@ bing , there was a fer@@ o@@ cious fear in my head .
i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emer@@ ges behind and through the old , like this . &quot;
and a sea that &apos;s just filled and te@@ em@@ ing with j@@ ell@@ yfish isn &apos;t very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans , that is , unless you eat j@@ ell@@ yfish .
and we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ essi@@ ons might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to encoura@@ ge the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
one of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shap@@ es .
so what you &apos;re seeing here is the one letter ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation for amin@@ o acids , and i &apos;ve col@@ ored in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es with green , and the al@@ an@@ ines in red , and so you can see it &apos;s just a lot of g &apos;s and a &apos;s .
and then a third attemp@@ t , which also pat@@ ched me back together pretty well , until it failed .
you come out of &quot; arri@@ ve &quot; at the air@@ p@@ ort , and you follow a big yellow sign that says &quot; tra@@ ins &quot; and it &apos;s in front of you .
the ch@@ am@@ b@@ al , if you look at it , has clear water .
newton adu@@ aka : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cin@@ em@@ a is for me , and where i &apos;m coming from in terms of cin@@ em@@ a .
it &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculp@@ ture .
&quot; if we acc@@ ept the theory of evolution , then the first da@@ wn of syn@@ thesis of life must con@@ s@@ ist in the production of forms inter@@ medi@@ ate between the in@@ organic and the organic world , or between the non-@@ living and living world , forms which pos@@ s@@ ess only some of the ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary at@@ tribu@@ tes of life &quot; -- so , the ones i just disc@@ ussed -- &quot; to which other at@@ tribu@@ tes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolu@@ tionary actions of the environment . &quot;
this number is small .
so the power of re@@ fram@@ ing things cannot be over@@ st@@ ated .
here i &apos;ll quote one of my students who said , &quot; sex is so good , it &apos;s good even when it &apos;s bad . &quot;
we said , &quot; well , what do ta@@ ils do ? &quot;
ok , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
when i was a student here in oxford in the 197@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ lea@@ k .
too much olymp@@ ics .
if you take 10,000 people at random , 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 99 have something in common : their interest@@ s in business lie on or near the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s dis@@ appeared . &quot;
and again we just finished the ec@@ b -- actually co@@ op hi@@ mm@@ el@@ blau in vi@@ en@@ na just won this project , where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a conne@@ ctive tissue of a park , which is parallel to the river , and develop@@ s ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the conne@@ ctive fab@@ ric -- the social , cultural and the landscape , re@@ crea@@ tional fab@@ ric of the city .
here &apos;s my study site . this is really a picture of ants , and the rab@@ bit just happens to be there .
let &apos;s see .
social learning really is visual the@@ ft .
we also were thinking about the experience of richard , and so -- -- we designed this hat , because i knew i &apos;d be the last one in the day and i needed to deal with him . so i just have one more thing to say .
they cannot feed their off@@ spring , their children , their breast mil@@ k because of the ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of these tox@@ ins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyram@@ id .
and because of that anno@@ un@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- whereas i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and rais@@ ing a ro@@ und of venture capital and r@@ amp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
you know , it &apos;s an old line , but it has been shown to work -- &quot; why don &apos;t you come up to my ca@@ ve , so i can show you my hand ax@@ es ? &quot;
i &apos;m just not in touch .
so they re@@ turned to their villages and are told they &apos;re going to get sick and die soon , but five happy years , their logic goes , is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the ou@@ ts@@ kir@@ ts of k@@ ie@@ v , separated from the gra@@ ves of their mothers and fa@@ thers and babies , the whis@@ per of stor@@ k wings on a spring after@@ noon .
like what &apos;s the pay@@ load it could carry ?
this is a ven@@ ding machine for cro@@ ws .
they like to name anything .
we needed to be@@ at solar cells .
and there &apos;s a ver@@ i@@ fication taking place .
it also makes it very vis@@ c@@ ous .
now this is quite time consum@@ ing and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
now how did we get here ?
in fact , she had a@@ ged a lot .
how do we stop people who &apos;ve beha@@ ved b@@ adly in one community doing so under a different gu@@ ise ?
sin@@ cer@@ ely , mi@@ ster michael ban@@ go@@ ora . &quot;
but there &apos;s also a scientific reason that dro@@ ve this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ g@@ it@@ u@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns language -- that child being my son .
and that would be that .
e@@ w : the full mon@@ ty .
i have strate@@ gi@@ cally cut mat@@ t &apos;s head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the swe@@ at@@ su@@ its .
it &apos;s kind of boring , but i &apos;ll just tell you a little bit about my family . i &apos;m one of 11 bro@@ thers and si@@ sters from la@@ ke@@ field , on@@ t@@ ario , an hour and a half nor@@ the@@ ast of toronto , and we grew up on a farm .
and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
and i saw my bat@@ tali@@ on com@@ man@@ der , because i had let him down .
there has to be a way to take a cen@@ sus of the rest of the bacteria in the population .
we share 9@@ 8@@ .@@ 8 percent of the genes .
there aren &apos;t many people around that are really involved with architecture as cli@@ ents .
so that &apos;s the design for manufac@@ ture question .
are these so bad that they out@@ wei@@ gh con@@ dem@@ ning 100,000 people a day to an un@@ necessarily early death ?
i moved out of the house , i got a job , i found a girl , i se@@ tt@@ led down -- and i realize it sounds like a bad si@@ t@@ com or a cat stev@@ ens &apos; song -- but life was pretty good .
now , what i &apos;d like to do is , to close , to share with you some research that i &apos;ve been doing .
well , you have to let me say this .
and out of this idea started spinn@@ ing off many , many kinds of variations of different plans and possi@@ bilities , and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the ex@@ hi@@ bits , and you see the inter@@ section of the plan with the tor@@ o@@ i@@ dal ge@@ ome@@ try .
and there is george bush sitting there going , &quot; he@@ h he@@ h he@@ h he@@ h ... &quot;
we &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot;
did it point up the degree to which he &apos;d ab@@ solved himself of the crash ?
they can watch it at their own time , at their own pace .
well , we &apos;re all equ@@ ally sop@@ hi@@ sticated .
do you believe that they can be used elsewhere , that the world can learn from this ?
it &apos;s a great honor to be here .
as if they were a rep@@ tile .
and it &apos;s very present in a crow@@ d like you .
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequ@@ ency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called str@@ ong@@ ly couple , and transfer magne@@ tic energy between them .
and they couldn &apos;t y@@ ank the cor@@ d out because it was scre@@ wed into a light so@@ cket inside the house .
this is another one of my favorite fish .
take your skin color , and cele@@ bra@@ te it .
this was a very exciting time , developing this with my wonderful afgh@@ an team .
right now , many of us do not even know that the fight is going on , but it is , whether you like it or not .
it turned out that ju@@ stin was almost certainly not au@@ ti@@ stic .
so , well , we could per@@ su@@ ade her to get into a train , and that &apos;s still a lot more efficient than a car , but that might be a li@@ fest@@ yle change , or there &apos;s the e@@ co-@@ car , top@@ -@@ left .
i think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and i think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ cti@@ vely as a culture .
it &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like to think about , but the fact that religious i@@ con@@ s and good lu@@ ck char@@ ms show up on d@@ ash@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds around the world betra@@ ys the fact that we know this to be true .
so i wrote the algorith@@ ms in code , and he built the hardware -- paul lau@@ ter@@ bu@@ r -- then went onto win the no@@ bel prize for inv@@ enting the mri .
an@@ and ag@@ ar@@ a@@ wal@@ a pres@@ ents bu@@ mp@@ top , a user interface that takes the usual desk@@ top metaphor to a gl@@ ori@@ ous , 3-@@ d extreme , trans@@ forming fi@@ le navi@@ gation into a free@@ whe@@ el@@ ing play@@ ground of c@@ rum@@ pl@@ ed docum@@ ents and cli@@ pp@@ ing-@@ covered &quot; walls . &quot;
employees mu@@ tu@@ ally inspi@@ re each other towards greater good .
and also tri@@ um@@ p@@ h , this sense of trans@@ cen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
and there &apos;s the con@@ version factor .
but i will end by saying that millions of years ago , we evolved three basic drives : the sex drive , roman@@ tic love and atta@@ ch@@ ment to a long-term partner .
economist el@@ en@@ i gab@@ re-@@ ma@@ d@@ hin out@@ lines her ambi@@ tious vision to found the first com@@ modi@@ ties market in eth@@ iop@@ ia . her plan would create wealth , mini@@ mi@@ ze risk for farmers and turn the world &apos;s largest reci@@ pi@@ ent of food aid into a regi@@ onal food bas@@ ke@@ t .
what &apos;s learning going to be like ? we know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ antly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
but that in fact seemed to be the case .
my parents named me sar@@ ah , which is a bibli@@ cal name .
and so that &apos;s the beginning of prote@@ i , and that &apos;s the first bo@@ at in history that completely changed the shape of the h@@ ull in order to control it , and the proper@@ ties of sa@@ iling that we get are very super@@ ior compared to a normal bo@@ at .
this is just a couple of them from janu@@ ary 17@@ th , last year .
so you &apos;re never going to see them on a bil@@ l@@ board .
other people will see if you &apos;re in the super@@ market line and you pull out your re@@ us@@ able gro@@ cer@@ y ba@@ g .
and so , with some ket@@ ch@@ up , — — and then i can kind of — — and that &apos;s awesome , right ?
will we in the united states continue to imp@@ ort efficient cars to replace foreign oil , or will we make efficient cars and imp@@ ort nei@@ ther the oil n@@ or the cars ?
it &apos;s a genetic dis@@ order , and it involves a twi@@ sting motion , and these children get pro@@ gressi@@ vely more and more twi@@ sting until they can &apos;t breathe , until they get sor@@ es , ur@@ in@@ ary infe@@ ctions , and then they die .
so we did this . we went down to ha@@ it@@ i .
bar@@ bar@@ ically , we &apos;re killing sharks for shar@@ k f@@ in sou@@ p , under@@ mining food cha@@ ins that shape planet@@ ary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle , the ni@@ trogen cycle , the oxygen cycle , the water cycle -- our life support system .
and therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mi@@ ce , into men , are not yiel@@ ding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
they live up there , and slightly to one side .
sop@@ ran@@ o : upon my pil@@ low safe in bed e@@ w : that &apos;s geor@@ gie from england . she &apos;s only nine .
and what i discovered is , what i should do is not actually rep@@ licate what they saw , is rep@@ licate what they remem@@ ber@@ ed .
so how many of you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
and even mi@@ gh@@ ty brazil is going down with five percent per year , and tur@@ key with seven percent per year .
simil@@ arly , let &apos;s look at a gran@@ ola bar .
we &apos;re going to use an un@@ usual combin@@ ation of tools from game theory and neurosci@@ ence to understand how people interact so@@ cially when value is on the line .
n@@ ell@@ ie m@@ ck@@ ay : &quot; mother of pe@@ ar@@ l , &quot; &quot; if i had you &quot;
what is so special about the human brain ?
it &apos;s like a drug deal .
and what we were trying to offer every day was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be re@@ moved , while in the united states , the final decision re@@ sted with the parents .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimp@@ se into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
so , shot dead , s@@ ma@@ cked over the head , you know , thro@@ wn away .
these discover@@ ies of behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers , and behavi@@ oral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the micros@@ cope because of our colle@@ cting data stre@@ ams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not , we had jum@@ ped the mo@@ at , we had clim@@ bed the f@@ ence , we were tip@@ to@@ eing through the dung and appro@@ aching some poor , do@@ zing co@@ w .
it knows that you are there .
i was ap@@ pointed as a teaching assi@@ st@@ ant at my university because i ac@@ compli@@ shed with honor .
if you take your thum@@ b and your inde@@ x finger and look right where they meet -- go ahead and do that now -- -- and rela@@ x your hand , you &apos;ll see a cr@@ in@@ kle , and then a wr@@ in@@ kle within the cr@@ in@@ kle , and a cr@@ in@@ kle within the wr@@ in@@ kle . right ?
&quot; connected &quot; is a collabor@@ ation with ch@@ or@@ e@@ o@@ grapher gi@@ de@@ on ob@@ arz@@ an@@ ek .
w@@ k : yeah .
when people see my images , a lot of times they &apos;ll say , &quot; oh my god . &quot; have you ever wonder@@ ed what that meant ?
they don &apos;t require any program@@ mers .
rules and in@@ centi@@ ves -- &quot; sticks &quot; and &quot; car@@ ro@@ ts . &quot;
ready , just play some time .
so , better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don &apos;t like is basically , better technology .
and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book sig@@ ning .
then , another ba@@ th@@ room up@@ sta@@ irs .
so imagine yourself .
the evidence is that the human way of life didn &apos;t change that much during that period .
it was in her brain , in her lung@@ s , in her li@@ ver .
in his home of nam@@ i@@ bia , john k@@ as@@ a@@ on@@ a is working on an innovative way to protect endangered animal species : giving ne@@ ar@@ by villa@@ gers responsibility for car@@ ing for the animals . and it &apos;s working .
but -- all of us own stuff .
so he twi@@ sted his memory around .
he &apos;s the one who first identi@@ fied this condition and raised the al@@ arm b@@ ells .
and the pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers i &apos;ve mentioned , the force has been auth@@ ori@@ zed , but almost no country on earth has ste@@ pped forward since the auth@@ ori@@ zation to actually put its tro@@ ops or its police in har@@ m &apos;s way .
the total wid@@ th of it is 600 times smaller than the wid@@ th of a deci@@ mal place .
military weap@@ on versions that were versions that car@@ ried hydro@@ gen bom@@ bs that could destro@@ y half the planet .
you drive on to a prob@@ os@@ cis . you get out . it li@@ f@@ ts you up .
there are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dro@@ pping on people &apos;s heads , ill@@ n@@ esses , etc .
okay , play that video please .
ni@@ cole : ni@@ cole .
how sa@@ d are you right now ?
but that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
i literally couldn &apos;t keep up with the dri@@ ft of the ice .
because , as b@@ m@@ i demonstr@@ ated , competi@@ tion here can achieve some form of balance . the same thing can happen now .
the village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education .
that , because the foot@@ print , as you can see , is just the pole tou@@ ching the ground .
she got pre@@ gn@@ ant , ran to the bush to have the baby , but you know , her body was very imm@@ ature , and she ended up having ob@@ stru@@ cted labor .
i have some pictures that represent my life and what i do for a living .
nothing can be done .
and also , there are other ways of activ@@ ating fo@@ x@@ o that don &apos;t even invol@@ ve insu@@ l@@ in or ig@@ f-@@ 1 that might even be sa@@ fer .
that &apos;s what re@@ min@@ ded me of it .
it was the first bat@@ tle that george washington won , in fact , and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of indepen@@ dence .
which of those happened first ?
it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon deli@@ vers the lec@@ ture using a framework of cap@@ tioning technology , we then add another technology to do video con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing .
she p@@ aus@@ ed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6@@ ,000 yu@@ an or 6@@ ,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6@@ ,000 . &quot;
last jun@@ e 1 , we launched . it was an exciting moment .
and these co@@ ws are e@@ aten basically in south america , in brazil and argent@@ ina . they &apos;re not being shi@@ pped up here .
and hydro@@ gen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and tru@@ cks when they &apos;re par@@ ked to generate electricity for the grid .
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fis@@ h@@ ing equipment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to main@@ tain the speci@@ alized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
and that &apos;s that all the sen@@ sa@@ tions , feelings , decisions and actions are medi@@ ated by the computer in your head called the brain .
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world -- australia , united states , u.k. and so on -- face in some of the dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ments that they &apos;re de@@ aling with in the modern world at this time .
and not everyone will . but you don &apos;t need everyone .
the insects and other species can take the pollen , transfer it directly to where it &apos;s required .
i looked around .
so if a 15@@ -year-old who didn &apos;t even know what a pan@@ cre@@ as was could find a new way to detect pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , just imagine what you could do .
and we got , again , about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
we can &apos;t predict speci@@ fically what particles will be produced in any individual colli@@ sion .
but i love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absor@@ b .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from sc@@ rat@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death pen@@ al@@ ty bigger .
and these col@@ um@@ ns , they have information at very many sc@@ ales .
there are , of course , entirely new art forms and new media , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days .
as mich@@ el f@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt puts it .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
sounds cool , right ?
the situation , to be honest , is very serious .
p@@ m : and the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clin@@ ic .
and chester car@@ l@@ son , the inv@@ ent@@ or , was a pat@@ ent at@@ tor@@ ney .
are there re@@ curr@@ ing patterns that we can learn from , that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives , or our own organizations , or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative ?
it was just at the end of a regu@@ lar day of work with the foundation .
someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further , and actually produce plac@@ e@@ bo education .
in the astero@@ ids clu@@ b , we don &apos;t start by looking for common ground .
after we had demonstr@@ ated that we could find small tumor@@ s , we used these images to sub@@ mit a gr@@ ant to the susan g@@ . kom@@ en foundation .
how many know him ? anybody ?
but this is the moment where everything becomes possible .
x is the un@@ known because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in span@@ ish .
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mista@@ ke , right ?
these are compla@@ in@@ ts cho@@ irs .
i mean , i want games to be a force for good in the world .
and that &apos;s what i want to share with you today -- the top five regre@@ ts of the dying .
but another thing about these indu@@ ced pl@@ uri@@ pot@@ ent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells , let &apos;s say , from people with a genetic disease and we engine@@ er tissu@@ es out of them , we can actually use tissu@@ e-@@ engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab .
and it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can en@@ coun@@ ter a new language in under a mile .
but if it comes for me , i &apos;m going to be ready .
kb : hold it right there .
but he found this wild plant called the lu@@ p@@ in bush .
that &apos;s our value pro@@ position in a prize .
and these migr@@ atory bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers are the last nom@@ ads of america .
the ear@@ liest cell phones , the ear@@ liest personal computers were invented in the 197@@ 0s .
and that fascinated me , to explore that terri@@ tory .
the first str@@ ing is the dr@@ one str@@ ing , which plays a continu@@ ous sound like the bag@@ pi@@ pe .
is there any cor@@ relation , positive or negative , between intelligence and tendency to be religious ?
voice 2 : it &apos;s coming again ?
as fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing as the pros@@ pe@@ ct was , he was going into the next office .
it could perhaps be a self-@@ organi@@ zing system , so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you , that children can self-@@ organi@@ ze and at@@ tain an edu@@ ca@@ tional obje@@ ctive .
but one of the things that we found it didn &apos;t bur@@ n as long . and the bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes c@@ rum@@ bl@@ ed a little bit , and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .
my name &apos;s ta@@ vi ge@@ vin@@ son , and the ti@@ tle of my talk is &quot; still fig@@ uring it out , &quot; and the ms paint quality of my sli@@ des was a total creative decision in keeping with today &apos;s theme , and has nothing to do with my in@@ ability to use powerpoint .
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 3@@ 30 days per year .
thanks very much .
i &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
and it need be@@ a@@ vers to create the we@@ t@@ lands , and maybe some other things .
but what is the use if the police department is in itself ste@@ ep@@ ed in corruption ?
it &apos;s pl@@ enty .
who de@@ fe@@ ated the global ji@@ had ? the american military did , the american soldiers did , with their alli@@ es , figh@@ ting in far@@ away bat@@ t@@ le@@ fields .
this is what jesus asked of us .
he said that , &quot; we might ne@@ gle@@ ct our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination . &quot;
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
and then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row .
we@@ t@@ lands glob@@ ally are one of the most endangered ec@@ osystems .
the answer , i think , is con@@ ta@@ ined in this incredible tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch from hier@@ ony@@ mus bos@@ ch , &quot; the gar@@ den of earth@@ ly del@@ igh@@ ts . &quot;
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very famous in ic@@ eland , went to ic@@ eland and spo@@ ke about this issue .
now the main bad guy , ru@@ g@@ ha@@ l , does not want these st@@ ones to update , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop up@@ dat@@ ing .
that &apos;s the other way that humor -- like art buch@@ wald takes sh@@ ots at the heads of state .
we feel comp@@ ell@@ ed to tell them .
and what the teacher does is literally just say , &quot; let me interven@@ e on the red kids . &quot;
my pre@@ ference is about 70 co@@ ats of this -- mat@@ te black auto pri@@ mer .
in mother &apos;s mil@@ k .
and then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other talks out there , especially ted@@ x talks , that are pop@@ ping up all over the world .
if you look at andro@@ me@@ da , which is the ne@@ ar@@ est big galaxy , and it &apos;s two million years ago .
he felt like they felt mani@@ pul@@ ated .
and so i &apos;m going to be condu@@ cting a course this summer for a group of people that are nom@@ in@@ ated by different folks to come and then give it , en masse , in communities all across the country , and we &apos;re going to update the sli@@ des@@ how for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cu@@ tting edge .
this one happened because i spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout america because i wanted it to be more than about my journey .
whereas on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people paid a lot more attention to her inno@@ cent belief , and said she deser@@ ved a lot less bl@@ ame for caus@@ ing the accident .
and beauty doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to goo@@ dness , and certainly doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to cont@@ ent@@ ment .
so fl@@ ur@@ ry of phone call@@ s and ema@@ ils from the new york times .
because that phase of soli@@ d ice la@@ sts for two months and it &apos;s full of cra@@ cks .
our vision is local manufac@@ turing , like the local food movement , for production .
and we did this passi@@ vely by looking at whether or not they &apos;d gone to university health services .
and when i say quite common , it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever en@@ counter@@ s another , which is a sa@@ d thought .
governments in africa have therefore been given an opportunity , by the international community , to avo@@ id building productive ar@@ ran@@ gem@@ ents with your own citizens , and therefore allowed to begin end@@ less ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations with the im@@ f and the world bank , and then it is the im@@ f and the world bank that tell them what its citizens need .
eventually ac@@ compani@@ ed him to his ran@@ ch to help him on those me@@ mo@@ irs , never fully understanding why he &apos;d ch@@ osen me to spend so many hours with .
my colleagues actually went on to test this limit@@ ation , by increasing the moment of in@@ er@@ tia of a student , so they had a tail , and running them through and ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le course , and found a de@@ cre@@ ment in per@@ for@@ man@@ ce , like you &apos;d predict .
so there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infra@@ struc@@ tural projects in china , which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the three gor@@ ges dam and many other expres@@ sions of state compe@@ ten@@ ce within china .
ask the t@@ ough questions . ask to see the evidence .
in the 198@@ 0s , i developed an under@@ water key@@ board .
now , it &apos;s kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slo@@ pe like this .
now , the story that plants are some low-@@ level organis@@ ms has been form@@ alized many times ago by ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le , that in &quot; de anim@@ a &quot; -- that is a very influ@@ ential book for the western civilization -- wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
i mean , on the slide , you can see that on our sensitive side , these cells that are respon@@ ding to the drug , when we start blo@@ cking the prot@@ ein , the number of dying cells -- those col@@ ored dots -- they &apos;re going down .
so this is the princi@@ pal of mind training .
he is really into dir@@ t@@ bike ra@@ cing , and he wants to be an architect .
but those two very smart international cen@@ sor@@ ship poli@@ cies didn &apos;t prevent chinese social media &#91; from &#93; becoming a really public sphere , a path@@ way of public opinion and the ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are of chinese offi@@ ci@@ als .
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written , or was writing at the time , didn &apos;t sound all that great in some of those h@@ alls .
not going to be easy . &quot;
here &apos;s another guy . you can play the diagn@@ osis game yourself here .
perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to re@@ mind the par@@ ties of what &apos;s really at sta@@ ke .
the first happy life is the pleas@@ ant life .
we can do things like tie our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cross the street by ourselves .
it &apos;s an aston@@ ishing insi@@ ght , and we have only found out about this recently .
now how could you re@@ pa@@ ir this ?
it &apos;s good to see you again .
it can put the price tag of stat@@ e-@@ sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed violence over non@@ violent prote@@ sters .
he said , &quot; we have a community that ow@@ ns its own company . &quot;
so thank you very much for being here . thank you very much .
i mean , we are .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of ca@@ ke . i like challenges .
i &apos;m going to do that in two ste@@ ps .
i consider myself the ti@@ de of sh@@ it .
you bre@@ ak@@ down the molecules , you recom@@ bine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plasti@@ cs that we en@@ joy each and every day .
where better to challenge those minds than here at ted ?
here &apos;s a cl@@ ue .
their gro@@ und@@ breaking technology recor@@ ds the ee@@ g , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allo@@ wing us to watch the brain as it per@@ forms various functions and then detect even the sli@@ gh@@ test ab@@ normal@@ ity in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audi@@ tion .
the ar@@ ctic -- a beautiful system -- a reg@@ ulating bi@@ ome at the planet@@ ary level , taking the kno@@ ck after kno@@ ck on climate change , appe@@ aring to be in a good state .
charles used to say , &quot; the ex@@ tent to which you have a design style is the ex@@ tent to which you have not solved the design problem . &quot;
so every tool that we &apos;ve ever had in the past has eventually become in@@ effective .
now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is di@@ ver@@ ging moment by moment as she is is@@ ol@@ ating her@@ self further and further .
two hundred years ago , the united states was less than a few percent ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed .
people were walking around ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed .
in virtu@@ ally every case , when poor farmers are given a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed market -- if you say , &quot; we will buy 300 me@@ tri@@ c tons of this .
ok , for me the street just rais@@ es so many different questions .
even about seem@@ ingly personal and vis@@ cer@@ al things like who you &apos;re attra@@ cted to , you will start ap@@ ing the belie@@ fs of the people around you without even reali@@ zing that that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
so , our first year of marri@@ age we went to 11 percent , second year we went to 12 percent , and the third year we went to 13 percent , and on and on and on . why did i do that ?
i never heard anyone say this about anderson co@@ oper and his cre@@ w who were attac@@ ked cover@@ ing the same story .
nam@@ ely , those who are looking at sp@@ am think pot@@ a@@ to chi@@ ps are going to be quite tast@@ y ; those who are looking at go@@ di@@ va cho@@ col@@ ate think they won &apos;t be nearly so tast@@ y .
it mi@@ mic@@ s perfectly all the ritu@@ als that we will find in off@@ ices : ritu@@ als of ent@@ ry , ritu@@ als of ex@@ it , the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es , the uni@@ forms in this country , things that identi@@ fy you , team@@ -@@ building activities , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
flight within ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates has only evolved three times : once in the bat@@ s , once in the birds , and once in the p@@ ter@@ od@@ ac@@ ty@@ ls .
oh wait , it &apos;s on your side , bar@@ ry .
these are female and male stem cells .
so , i turned on the tv , and i don &apos;t watch tv very much , but you know this person ? this is paris hil@@ ton , appar@@ ently .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ?
the b@@ ard said everything best , of course , and he &apos;s making my point here but he &apos;s making it hyper@@ bo@@ lic@@ ally : &quot; &apos; tis nothing good or bad / but thinking makes it so . &quot;
this is da@@ ve ar@@ ring@@ d@@ ale who &apos;s actually been a lon@@ g@@ time gu@@ est at vivi@@ an &apos;s mot@@ el .
but that &apos;s totally another and separate top@@ ic .
y@@ as@@ hen@@ g hu@@ ang : does democracy sti@@ f@@ le economic growth ?
so it &apos;s likely that i &apos;m related to every res@@ ni@@ ck that i ever meet , but i don &apos;t know .
for a hun@@ gry child , poli@@ tics and freedom are not even thought of .
we don &apos;t need any of that ; we work on a be@@ ating heart .
so of course , this is a very cru@@ de machine , but we &apos;re working on a micro@@ -@@ scale version of these , and hopefully the cu@@ bes will be like a po@@ w@@ der that you p@@ our in .
give me no@@ vel@@ ty , give me famili@@ ar@@ ity .
now , i would say , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-@@ on-@@ one ? &quot;
so i kept on thinking , where do those cru@@ sts go ?
so my fres@@ h@@ man year of college i signed up for an inter@@ n@@ ship in the hous@@ ing un@@ it at greater boston legal services .
that means 9@@ 1 percent , even after the cen@@ sus , still remain to be discovered .
she thought i &apos;d gone off my head .
that &apos;s ne@@ o-@@ na@@ z@@ i math for you .
try experi@@ en@@ cing that on a kind@@ le .
so he said , &quot; all right . i get the point . &quot; he went back .
and it &apos;s really an od@@ d sort of structure .
it developed in colle@@ cti@@ ves of human beings .
i think , quite a nice feature .
describe for me the equipment since you have it here .
back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , no one touched the contin@@ ent with a bar@@ ge pole .
this remarkable image is not a map of the world .
it completely blo@@ ws apart the way that per@@ fu@@ me is , and provi@@ des a whole new form@@ at .
but i think people have recogni@@ zed the san@@ cti@@ ty of our urban areas .
he said human beings act differently when they know they &apos;re alone than when they know somebody else is around .
and so the idea of ro@@ le-@@ play is both as an em@@ pathy tool , as well as a tool for pro@@ totyp@@ ing experiences .
are treated with more and more skep@@ tic@@ ism , and move off the table .
you want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check , th@@ row money at you , right there before you leave .
i mean , companies are all about finding the right people , in@@ spir@@ ing those people , you know , dra@@ wing out the best in people .
thank you .
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own p@@ ort .
and it &apos;s a series of markets for low-@@ level trade that can be ful@@ filled by a person or a small company .
person@@ ally , i really didn &apos;t know if i was capable of hand@@ ling such a mon@@ str@@ ous task .
so for every digital ren@@ e@@ ga@@ de that is revol@@ ting in the streets of te@@ hr@@ an , there may as well be two digital cap@@ tives who are actually re@@ b@@ elling only in the world of war@@ craft .
in northern india , we started m@@ apping the cases using satelli@@ te ima@@ ging like this , so that we could gui@@ de our invest@@ ments and vacc@@ in@@ ator shel@@ ters , so we could get to the millions of children on the kos@@ hi river bas@@ in where there are no other health services .
after all , it was the buildings , not the earth@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , that killed 2@@ 20@@ ,000 people , that in@@ ju@@ red 3@@ 30,000 , that dis@@ placed 1.@@ 3 million people , that cut off food and water and supp@@ lies for an entire nation .
and it &apos;s something i &apos;ve never really found a good way of doing .
but we know how to fix this .
they have something called r@@ na instead .
and l@@ o and be@@ hold , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak .
so i constantly chat@@ ted to him about bo@@ y@@ friends , even when i didn &apos;t have any at all .
they thought it would reduce their property values .
so let me start in on that problem .
and of course , it made me question , if i wasn &apos;t able to have another child , what would that mean for my marri@@ age , and just me as a woman .
gre@@ etings to all of you from pakistan .
so today i want to up@@ grade it to 2.@@ 0 version .
it &apos;s not obvious exactly what &apos;s going on .
so , effectively we created a digital puppe@@ t that bra@@ d pit@@ t could oper@@ ate with his own face .
it &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wi@@ der world .
what the global deli@@ very model allows is , it allows you to take previ@@ ously geo@@ graphi@@ cally cor@@ e-@@ lo@@ cated tas@@ ks , break them up into parts , send them around the world where the exper@@ ti@@ se and the cost structure exists , and then speci@@ fy the means for rein@@ te@@ gr@@ ating them .
i have to kill a fren@@ ch@@ man when i come back at home ?
you can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a te@@ tr@@ is game that you wrote in jack and then comp@@ iled into machine language in a comp@@ il@@ er that you wrote also , and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand n@@ and g@@ ates .
we started with a slide of my te@@ ds , and i had to add this slide , because i knew that the minute i showed this , my mom -- my mom will see this de@@ ck somehow , because she does read my blog -- and she &apos;ll say , &quot; why wasn &apos;t there a picture of me ? &quot;
about a billion miles away , here &apos;s what happens to earth &apos;s or@@ bit : it becomes elli@@ p@@ tical instead of circu@@ lar .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation@@ -@@ state level , and we had to have mu@@ tual non-@@ ag@@ gr@@ ession , or through a series of confli@@ cts , we eventually came to a r@@ ough international bar@@ ga@@ in to lar@@ gel@@ y keep the peace .
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed .
they don &apos;t feel as if they &apos;re doing something that really matters to them , so they pick up these kinds of activities .
all of us ? designers ?
and if there &apos;s one bran@@ ch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the no@@ des of cros@@ sing -- internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative path@@ ways for chan@@ nel@@ ing nutri@@ ents and information .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
i developed a dete@@ ctor that re@@ places the current dete@@ ctors that hom@@ eland security has .
life can &apos;t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
so , he pe@@ ti@@ tioned the higher go@@ ds so that he may have justice .
and they all kind of lau@@ gh@@ ed and they pat@@ ted him on the back .
that &apos;s a real uncomfortable feeling , when all the equipment &apos;s come out and a whole son@@ y team , and people are going to be sitting there in the audience .
i didn &apos;t take them . how did i get them ?
and that &apos;s going to pose an enorm@@ ous problem .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swe@@ pt around the world .
so , this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nur@@ ture its own cycle of crow@@ d-@@ acceler@@ ated innovation .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear a t@@ one -- and a fl@@ ash of light occurred there .
this is the size of the earth going through that same -- -- frame . and to make it really clear , i &apos;ve put all four on one graph .
vulner@@ ability is not we@@ ak@@ ness .
on the other hand , if you light a mat@@ ch the whole planet will blo@@ w up .
n@@ m : i &apos;m not tun@@ ed . hold on .
so oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
in this case , she pi@@ cks up her phone , she can map food prepar@@ ation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sun@@ light . an algorith@@ m will keep it in that location as long as she &apos;s enga@@ ged in that activity .
we &apos;re trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa . they will die soon .
any vehi@@ cu@@ lar ou@@ ting with that woman from the time i was a young child , guys , naturally included fl@@ ash@@ ing , blue lights .
that exac@@ er@@ bat@@ es and contin@@ ues this model .
they &apos;re actually both pro@@ of of how right vol@@ ta@@ ire was when he talked about the benefits of work , and the fact that it sa@@ ves us from not one but three great evi@@ ls .
but not just work . it &apos;s within these tri@@ bes that societies get built , that important things happen .
part of the art of designing a simple , good interface , is kno@@ wing when to use which one of these fe@@ atures .
the cor@@ als say , &quot; you che@@ ated . you didn &apos;t pay your r@@ ent . &quot;
i &apos;ve run several dozen such sur@@ ve@@ ys in different parts of the world , and in all cases except one , where a group actually under@@ estim@@ ated the tra@@ de-@@ to-@@ g@@ dp ra@@ ti@@ o , people have this tendency towards over@@ esti@@ ma@@ tion , and so i thought it important to give a name to this , and that &apos;s what i re@@ fer to as global@@ on@@ ey , the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars .
but the problem is these are in@@ struc@@ tional cue devices .
this is in response to the aw@@ ful mobile tra@@ il@@ ers and the out@@ dated text@@ books and the terrible materials that we &apos;re building schools out of these days .
so let &apos;s start with care anywhere .
and almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both .
the present en@@ cap@@ su@@ l@@ ates the past and a promise for the future .
and to do that -- the brain doesn &apos;t feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that &apos;s gone into the internet and communic@@ ations and so on -- op@@ tical fi@@ bers connected to las@@ ers that you can use to activ@@ ate , in animal models for example , in pre-@@ clin@@ ical studies , these neurons and to see what they do .
and that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ changing between groups .
i hold out hope that we &apos;ll be able to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this conflict with some sort of , some yet un@@ invented technology .
&quot; why ? because you don &apos;t let us develop .
two new kinds of wh@@ ales have been discovered , along with two new an@@ tel@@ op@@ es , do@@ zens of mon@@ key species and a new kind of eleph@@ ant -- and even a distinct kind of gor@@ ill@@ a .
but today , against my better judg@@ ment , against the ad@@ vice of my own wife , i want to try to d@@ ust off some of those legal skills -- what &apos;s left of those legal skills .
out of ad@@ versi@@ ty can come innovation , and how can we help the ambi@@ tious co@@ ders and ma@@ kers in kenya to be res@@ ili@@ ent in the face of proble@@ ma@@ tic infrastructure ?
natural sound can do that too .
these women weren &apos;t going to go to anybody else because they liked me , and i kind of figu@@ red it out .
could we have the solutions ?
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in fa@@ vor of civili@@ an nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predi@@ cted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 20@@ 11 .
the three of us go to the ex@@ am together , and we sit down .
and i mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , &quot; look , i &apos;m good .
you could say to a princi@@ pal , &quot; you &apos;re having a problem every th@@ ur@@ s@@ day at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
this is work done by qu@@ enti@@ n lin@@ d@@ sey who &apos;s a gradu@@ ate student .
and i can &apos;t help but en@@ joy looking at everything in the world .
which isn &apos;t a great idea .
we have a technology that works , and one that , if used cor@@ rec@@ tly , will alle@@ vi@@ ate some of the pressure we are putting on the world &apos;s ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us reser@@ ves .
but i don &apos;t know , reading things on a laptop -- whenever i pull up my laptop , it always feels like work .
although it &apos;s called agriculture in the world of food .
rather than getting your camera out of your po@@ cket , you can just do the gest@@ ure of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .
a chinese speak@@ er can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speak@@ er &apos;s e@@ ars .
there &apos;s a great ne@@ al ste@@ phen@@ son line where he says that wired people should know something about wir@@ es .
and i said , &quot; well , when did you decide ? &quot;
take a look at what brain activity might look like .
in that case , the con@@ sequences are rather sever@@ e .
you can see things . not only the face shape changes , but all sorts of different skin bu@@ ck@@ ling and skin wr@@ in@@ kl@@ ing occur@@ s .
who are the c@@ ast of charac@@ ters ? what &apos;s the co@@ stu@@ me ?
now , he gets excited . that &apos;s exc@@ it@@ ement , you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
but , either way , you fall for the rest of your life .
and all of this has fu@@ eled an increase , very smo@@ oth and predi@@ c@@ table , of productivity .
because pi@@ cking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren &apos;t doing equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um analysis as well .
there were big wel@@ ts all over my mom &apos;s kitchen cab@@ in@@ et ; the air was the just full of black smo@@ ke .
&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; i ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;
sle@@ ep@@ y man ban@@ j@@ o boys : blue@@ gr@@ ass virtu@@ osity from ... new jer@@ sey ?
so low income here , high income there .
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the la@@ go@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
and you see , some of the bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence they use to avo@@ id being e@@ aten , some they use to attra@@ ct pre@@ y , but all of it , from an arti@@ stic point of view , is posi@@ tively amazing .
but it &apos;s hard to break our hab@@ its , our ad@@ ult hab@@ its .
z@@ f : so what i did was i took those vo@@ ic@@ ema@@ ils , and with their per@@ mission , conver@@ ted them to mp@@ 3@@ s and distribu@@ ted them to sound edi@@ tors who created short sounds using just those vo@@ ic@@ ema@@ ils .
it &apos;s not a particularly great metaphor in these times , especially if you live around the gulf of mexico , but i would , perhaps , adap@@ t this metaphor slightly , and i would say that data is the new soil .
my failure to pro@@ cure myself a c@@ up of swe@@ et , green te@@ a was not due to a simple mis@@ understanding .
and i started watching k@@ ak@@ i king a lot , and she would always ci@@ te pre@@ ston re@@ ed as a big influence , so then i started watching his videos , and it &apos;s very sur@@ real right now to be -- was that piece just now , that was one of his songs that you learned , or how did that happen ?
other organizations send volunte@@ ers .
we create things .
it &apos;s not possible . it would be nice but let &apos;s be reali@@ stic .
please welcome am@@ anda kit@@ ts .
if you just take influ@@ en@@ za , you will see pe@@ a@@ ks at the time where you knew big flu epide@@ mic@@ s were killing people around the glo@@ be .
animals too .
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a com@@ et passed over the mountain . hy@@ aku@@ take .
we can only watch so much .
we need green@@ peace to work with w@@ w@@ f .
40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
they were trying to put our air@@ line out of business , and they launched what &apos;s become known as the dirty tricks campaign .
ju@@ lian san@@ che@@ z : i &apos;m going to make an obser@@ vation about the way re@@ mix culture seems to be evol@@ ving ...
so i think these projects i &apos;ve showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we imple@@ ment these new technologies for a new self-@@ assem@@ bling world .
now , the str@@ ength for those top 20 percent is starting to fa@@ de on a rela@@ tive basis , but even more concer@@ ning is the education that the balance of people are getting .
of course , re@@ f@@ using to grow up -- -- even though i im@@ person@@ ate a grow@@ n@@ -up in daily life , but i do a fairly good job of that -- but really re@@ ta@@ ining that child@@ like quality of not car@@ ing what other people think about what you &apos;re interested in , is really critical .
but something kept on fli@@ ck@@ ering before my eyes .
the pack has got to be able to s@@ wal@@ low its e@@ go , be cooperative and pull together .
i bought myself a nice suit and wor@@ e lea@@ ther@@ -@@ sol@@ ed sho@@ es and re@@ vel@@ ed in this amazing access i had to world events .
rice university professor richard bar@@ ani@@ uk explains the vision behind conne@@ xi@@ ons , his open-@@ source , online education system . it cu@@ ts out the text@@ book , allo@@ wing teachers to share and modi@@ fy course materials fre@@ ely , anywhere in the world .
we &apos;re so cle@@ ver we can over@@ come all of these seem@@ ing biological im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments .
a happy patient is a healthy patient . &quot;
we have no water what@@ so@@ ever .
today , my two sons david and daniel can talk to my parents and get to know them .
ten@@ ac@@ ity is how i kept at it against all od@@ ds .
but it &apos;s going to have a big impact because we &apos;re going to have ni@@ che drugs .
remember pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar .
now , sud@@ hi@@ r got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assi@@ gn@@ ment of trying to take the i@@ o@@ wa fran@@ ch@@ ise .
but this is a str@@ ength , if you &apos;re working , for example , in technology .
let &apos;s take a look .
and i like to ex@@ hi@@ bit these paintings in the ex@@ hibi@@ tion h@@ alls without lab@@ els , and then i ask people , &quot; which one do you pre@@ fer ? &quot;
and what language would it take ?
i &apos;m as@@ suming there are not many people here who speak ic@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c .
when these neurons interact , the chemical reaction em@@ its an electrical impul@@ se , which can be measu@@ red .
all right , i like the people doing both . you are over@@ achie@@ vers .
there &apos;ll be no air@@ plan@@ es flying .
although the sc@@ en@@ ario has changed very consi@@ der@@ ably , the fact is that we haven &apos;t changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means .
so , when the us@@ da finally ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encoura@@ ged us , via their over@@ ly simp@@ li@@ stic food pyram@@ id , to eat five ser@@ vings of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables a day , along with more car@@ bs .
and so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . we &apos;re planning a perman@@ ent home in chicago .
and it works like this -- this doesn &apos;t actually produce any sound .
but how do we do that ?
and what makes me sa@@ d about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest cor@@ relation with corruption is wealth .
and then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well .
although it &apos;s closer , i heard this morning , it &apos;s closer than i thought it was .
the books and the solution get thro@@ wn in the ti@@ gr@@ is river .
i would like us to work towards that .
eventually , if you keep going down in these things , prob@@ ability says that you &apos;re going to run into a place like this .
if we go to the island of pap@@ u@@ a new guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spo@@ ken on that island alone .
and the kingdom of israel , which is headed by king sau@@ l , obviously cat@@ ches wind of this , and sau@@ l brings his ar@@ my down from the mountains and he con@@ fron@@ ts the phili@@ st@@ ines in the valley of el@@ ah , one of the most beautiful of the val@@ le@@ ys of the she@@ ph@@ el@@ ah .
think of what that means .
i had never heard of the islands 10 years ago , n@@ or the country , ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i , that ow@@ ns them , ti@@ ll two friends of mine who run a li@@ ve@@ abo@@ ard di@@ ve bo@@ at in fi@@ j@@ i said , &quot; gre@@ g , would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands ?
and , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people -- i think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; what is worth living for ? &quot;
the second one was about a woman complaining because three mini@@ v@@ ans with six be@@ ar@@ ded men pulled up and started inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
look how fat he is . he &apos;s walking back to feed his chi@@ cks .
they have figu@@ red out everything that &apos;s required to dis@@ man@@ tle , take things apart , re@@ write the circu@@ it@@ ry , re-@@ fl@@ ash the fir@@ m@@ ware , do whatever you want to with the phone , and they can fix anything so quickly .
if you think about it , sha@@ ker@@ ism was a pro@@ to-@@ environmental movement .
it &apos;s using the ap@@ i of a really great company that i work with in new york , actually , called day@@ life .
and so compu@@ tation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something , to reduce the size of the genome that you &apos;re building .
okay , there it goes . right now .
when mel@@ in@@ da and i learned how little useful feedback most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away .
so , you go back to the old indo-@@ european root again , and what do you find ? the indo-@@ european stem is pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced pay@@ en -- we would sp@@ ell it p@@ -@@ a-@@ e-@@ n -- and , l@@ o and be@@ hold , mi@@ rab@@ ile dic@@ t@@ u , it is the same root as the word compassion comes from , p@@ -@@ a-@@ e-@@ n .
so much of london &apos;s meat was coming from the north@@ west , from scot@@ land and wal@@ es .
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life .
when you open this for growing oil pal@@ ms you &apos;re creating co2 vol@@ can@@ o@@ es that are em@@ it@@ ting so much co2 that my country is now the third largest em@@ it@@ ter of greenhouse g@@ asses in the world , after china and the united states .
this is a dna synthesi@@ zer , and here at the bottom are just bott@@ les of a , t , c and g -- the four che@@ mic@@ als that make up our dna chain .
we know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get a@@ ge-@@ related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been acc@@ um@@ ulating since before we were born .
it &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous to china and the far east , but given that the pre@@ val@@ ence of malaria is here in africa , pat@@ ri@@ ck and his colleagues said , &quot; let &apos;s bring it here , because it &apos;s a high valu@@ e-@@ add product . &quot;
if nothing else , at least i &apos;ve discovered what it is we put our speak@@ ers through : swe@@ at@@ y pal@@ ms , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess ni@@ ghts , a wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ natural fear of clo@@ cks .
but people see a society for what it is , and that , it seems to me , is what ultimately will make a difference in today &apos;s information era , in today &apos;s ted age .
and you put lots of them together and you come with something called inte@@ gr@@ ated circu@@ its .
so we &apos;re starting with a variety of technologies that have conver@@ ged into these conver@@ sa@@ tional character robots that can see faces , make eye cont@@ act with you , make a full range of fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , understand speech and begin to model how you &apos;re feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you .
and with that in mind , i &apos;d like to say a few words about traditional college gra@@ ding .
i saw fir@@ st-@@ hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time , like everything beautiful in nature , is ut@@ ter@@ ly simple .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. ba@@ ti@@ uk .
and the other ner@@ dy side of me thought , &quot; this is horrible . this is completely bi@@ zar@@ re .
but you have it in planets and astero@@ ids .

but then at the very end is where we have the instru@@ mental record in black .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
that is to say , they speci@@ alize with respect to re@@ production .
and then this happened .
i had never had to deal with a black@@ out .
this ben@@ ch , although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn &apos;t like sitting on it , so she went and bought these c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons for me from a local jum@@ ble s@@ ale -- re@@ using , a job that was pretty good .
so , take , for example , the three-@@ way inter@@ section .
so a subject you &apos;re passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .
and that is the power of transformation .
it didn &apos;t happen acci@@ dent@@ ally .
i can explain you . i shall try .
a good reader has an artist &apos;s passion , a will@@ ing@@ ness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the rea@@ ders also needs the cool@@ ness of judg@@ ment of a scientist , which acts to temp@@ er and comp@@ licate the reader &apos;s intui@@ tive reac@@ tions to the story .
i welcome you on board for us to engage and disc@@ uss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initi@@ a@@ tives and disc@@ us@@ sions .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you &apos;re experim@@ enting with , and you allow it in another group that you &apos;re experim@@ enting with , and then you present those r@@ ats with a cat od@@ or@@ -@@ satur@@ ated col@@ lar , they &apos;re hard@@ wired to fle@@ e and hi@@ de .
and i noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just bar@@ ely see them walking across the bridge .
when does a ner@@ d turn into as@@ per@@ ger , which is just mil@@ d autis@@ m ?
now i think a little bit like the i@@ ke@@ a effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they &apos;re doing to a higher degree .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clo@@ cks , rather than somehow sen@@ sing the day outside .
and the d@@ m@@ ca goes back to the audio home recording act , which horri@@ fied those industri@@ es .
it &apos;s a con@@ den@@ s@@ able in the atmosphere , and so recogni@@ zing this cir@@ cum@@ stance brought to the fore a whole world of bi@@ zar@@ re possi@@ bilities . you can have me@@ than@@ e clouds , ok , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of ha@@ ze , which prevent any sun@@ light from getting to the surface .

and i want to ask three questions in this talk , in the 10 minutes that remain , about the blog@@ os@@ phere .
and i just thought to myself , &quot; wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
i think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly &apos;s brain can process information .
without saying too much about this case , this is a traffic accident , a dr@@ un@@ k driver hit a woman .
so i &apos;m going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chap@@ ters .
with inte@@ gr@@ ated circu@@ its , you can build cell@@ phones .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re st@@ ac@@ ked up .
and , you know , i mean , i &apos;ll look at a couple of things like this , but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for na@@ vel ga@@ zing .
so , it makes one wonder , &quot; why is it there ? &quot;
you will never see it again . &quot;
we managed , but sometimes those h@@ alls didn &apos;t seem exactly su@@ ited to the music i was making or had made .
you turn up the heat , you start making or breaking chemical bon@@ ds in the su@@ gar , forming a brow@@ nis@@ h car@@ am@@ el , right ?
we &apos;re going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and conne@@ cting to the world around us .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re actually going to set up these me@@ etings ourselves .
he knew that dar@@ k@@ ly p@@ ig@@ ment@@ ed peop@@ les were found close to the equ@@ ator ; li@@ ghtly p@@ ig@@ ment@@ ed peop@@ les , like himself , were found closer to the pol@@ es .

this is something that we &apos;re using today to search for e@@ .@@ t. , and the electronics have gotten very much better too .
i could ro@@ tate it by a third of a turn , or a half a turn , or put it back down on its image , or two thirds of a turn .

you can &apos;t cure or prevent what you don &apos;t know is there .
we &apos;re going as fast as we can .
it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for , because i know this strug@@ gle isn &apos;t my own .

what was the greatest invention of the industrial revolution ? hans rosling makes the case for the was@@ h@@ ing machine . with new@@ ly designed graphi@@ cs from g@@ ap@@ min@@ der , rosling shows us the magic that pop@@ s up when economic growth and electricity turn a boring was@@ h day into an intellectual day of reading .

i was still interested in this question of how do you take ban@@ da@@ ges off bur@@ n patients .
let me give you a quick s@@ nap@@ shot of what mali@@ cious code is capable of today .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
in a way , i &apos;ve got some bad news , particularly to anybody who &apos;s come to oxford from ab@@ road .

many times , the prison auth@@ orities have den@@ i@@ ed ever having issues of drug ab@@ use , issues of so@@ dom@@ y , so many issues they would den@@ y that it ever happens .
but this is a nice , sl@@ ender , very bad p@@ est .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
and this can be used by anyone .
this is the sound of a ship , and i &apos;m having to talk a little lou@@ der to talk over it .
so that &apos;s what statisti@@ cians would call an as@@ su@@ mption of indepen@@ dence .
brian sk@@ er@@ ry : the ocean &apos;s gl@@ ory -- and hor@@ ror
this is called &quot; li@@ mit out . &quot;
and one of the other things that i said to her through the trans@@ l@@ ator -- again , this thing about saying stop -- was to not pay attention to me .
now , for gal@@ o@@ is , there was actually a six@@ th symmetry .
yeah , that &apos;s particularly gor@@ ge@@ ous -- it &apos;s the tv dinner of 200@@ 1 .
there is no cre@@ ator here to be recogni@@ zed .
by the way , it &apos;s spr@@ ing@@ time now in israel .
so that &apos;s what led me to al@@ zhei@@ mer &apos;s . i started reading about al@@ zhei@@ mer &apos;s and tried to famili@@ ari@@ ze myself with the research , and at the same time when i was in the -- i was reading in the medical library one day , and i read this article about something called &quot; pur@@ ine deri@@ va@@ tives . &quot;
the al@@ umin@@ um is because it &apos;s very light .
and she read so many no@@ vels , so many different no@@ vels here .
i think there &apos;s biology to that .
but what about oil ? where is it in the energy system ?
we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body .

i was born in 19@@ 44 in brazil , in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy .
good evening . my name is hab@@ bi bel@@ a@@ ha@@ l .
and as these villages have a better standard of life , they are actually agre@@ eing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the hig@@ hl@@ ands asi@@ de , so that once again , as the trees grow back , the chimpanze@@ es will have le@@ af@@ y cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic vi@@ ability -- with other re@@ m@@ n@@ ant groups outside the national park .
there was no one to rel@@ ate publi@@ c@@ ly to .
now he &apos;s put together some thoughts : about half of that he &apos;ll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of ste@@ ps , tax@@ es will be appro@@ ved .
we have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
so after some gui@@ ded trial and er@@ ror , the child will discover , with or without help , that he or she can du@@ p@@ licate the original figure and then take the result , transp@@ ose it , gl@@ ue it to the original and then proce@@ ed &#91; with &#93; what we did before : cut , re@@ ar@@ range , pa@@ ste — o@@ ops — pa@@ ste and gl@@ ue , and tile .

what if my room@@ mate knew about my wonder@@ fully ambi@@ tious hair bra@@ i@@ der , who has just started her own business selling hair ex@@ ten@@ sions ?
i want to suggest that there &apos;s three things that help us to make our peace with regre@@ t .
one option is the fast food fe@@ tish .
should we worry . no , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
but it &apos;s very much at the beginning .
so , now we believe that the different shape of the l@@ ure is how the male recogni@@ zes the female in the an@@ gl@@ er@@ fish world , because many of these mal@@ es are what are known as d@@ warf mal@@ es .
just south of the sahar@@ a we find the sa@@ he@@ l .
think about how an individual respon@@ ds to a diagn@@ osis of a life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening illness and how li@@ fest@@ yle changes that previ@@ ously were just too difficult suddenly become rela@@ tively easy .
i told him only that he had killed one man , not two .
we have to plan issues many months in adv@@ ance ; we have to guess at what public appe@@ ti@@ tes are going to be six months , nine months down the road . so we &apos;re in the for@@ ec@@ ast@@ ing business .
they &apos;re like gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s .
we say , &quot; china , it &apos;s y@@ ours . &quot;
just one eye , looking at you , and el@@ im@@ in@@ ating everything else about a face , but just to consider ga@@ ze in an is@@ ol@@ ated way as a kind of , as an element .
and i think by pul@@ ling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and le@@ verage these , we &apos;re going to em@@ power the patient , en@@ able the doctor , en@@ h@@ ance well@@ ness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; car@@ ne , you have to be very cle@@ ver to be a diplom@@ at . &quot;
and what you can see is that nearly all the spi@@ der dra@@ gl@@ ines sur@@ pass them .
and environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
this is one that bl@@ ames you .
but if you give people vitamin d supp@@ le@@ ments , you don &apos;t change that high rate of heart disease .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convin@@ cing everybody that child labor just had to be aboli@@ shed .
and this is my -- -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
and when you synthesi@@ ze it all , it &apos;s giving us a new view of human nature .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
by tar@@ ge@@ ting the red system , what we are able to do is to make speci@@ es@@ -@@ specific , or diseas@@ e-@@ specific , anti-@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing molecules .

sam@@ u@@ el pier@@ pon@@ t lang@@ ley was given 5@@ 0,000 dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine .
one idea is to dra@@ sti@@ cally reduce public support for the arts .
i was 23 years old . no one my age had attemp@@ ted anything like this , and pretty quickly , almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong .
this is a disaster .
pretty good . and at school ?
and actually , in hot weather , i can just grow it outside .
we have to start colle@@ cting from 5@@ 55 .
i don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
most of my childhood was spent playing with le@@ gos .
another is newton and the apple , when newton was at cambridge .
you get gr@@ ass@@ roots solutions , things that work for people who have no capital or limited access .
now , i should say one thing that &apos;s very dis@@ hear@@ ten@@ ing .
but you get the picture . and then it goes to the in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation .
and our goal was to try to human@@ i@@ ze them a bit , and what i did was add type and people to the ad , which the previous campaign had not had , and nobody remem@@ ber@@ ed them , and nobody refer@@ enced them .
if you said to them , &quot; don &apos;t do this anymore , &quot; they &apos;d wonder what you were talking about .
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big clean@@ up operation on mt . everest .
so we said , &quot; what can we do with the as@@ ha wor@@ ker that &apos;ll allow this as@@ ha wor@@ ker to become an interesting filter , but not just a filter , a really well thought through refer@@ ral system that allows load balan@@ cing of the network , and dire@@ cts patients to different sour@@ ces of health care based on the sever@@ ity or the cri@@ tic@@ al@@ ness of those situ@@ ations ? &quot;
so it was pretty interesting stuff .

i was in ye@@ men recently , where -- it &apos;s the home of the last al qa@@ e@@ da fran@@ ch@@ ise that still as@@ p@@ ires to attack america , attack the west .

the light comes in from the left , his face is ba@@ th@@ ed in this glo@@ wing light . it &apos;s right in the center of the painting , and you look at it , and i found that when i was looking at it , i was standing there going , &quot; look at me . please look at me . &quot;
so most open-@@ source projects just held their n@@ os@@ es and adop@@ ted the feu@@ dal management systems .
those in small businesses can &apos;t get the capital they need to expand and those in micro@@ business can &apos;t grow out of them .

they &apos;re about doing sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce on people they know are inno@@ cent .
this is the most successful order on the planet by far .
you see a 20-@@ ye@@ ar@@ s-@@ old , 3@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar@@ s-@@ old families in a refuge@@ e camp@@ s .
the couple are bar@@ ely 18 years old .
so , it op@@ ens up more questions than it answers , i &apos;m afraid , but that &apos;s what , you know , science is really good at .
that little tag can record temperature , dep@@ th and light intensi@@ ty , which is cor@@ related with time , and from that we can get lo@@ cations .
what &apos;s nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see , oh ok , i understand now .
what we did , anyway , look , what we did , we didn &apos;t just take this lying down at john h@@ unter hospital and elsewhere .
she decided she really liked robots .
and there &apos;s the myth@@ ic glamour of the garage entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r .
and he thought to himself , &quot; they go from one den@@ si@@ ty of medium , the air , into another den@@ si@@ ty of medium , water , without a sp@@ l@@ ash . look at this picture .
if one of those fail@@ s , you still have a second chance .
and i learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
it se@@ ts things into perspective , etc . , etc .
and if i -- if i &apos;m not interested in something , i don &apos;t gras@@ p it .
i call this process &quot; patter@@ ni@@ city &quot; -- that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaning@@ less noise .
so this is a computer program .
scientists use ro@@ v@@ s to explore the oceans .
and it &apos;s really un@@ fair to humanity , because humanity is actually much more cooperative and em@@ path@@ ic than given cre@@ dit for .
the famous su@@ fi master rum@@ i , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he kno@@ cks on the door , and a voice answers , &quot; who &apos;s there ? &quot;
given the computer model , we can test the model by essentially qui@@ z@@ zing it .
and we didn &apos;t find a single record of any pre@@ ference about goals , treatments or out@@ comes from any of the se@@ ts of not@@ es initi@@ ated by a doctor or by a patient .
so there was the co@@ be satelli@@ te , which was launched in 198@@ 9 , and we discovered these variations .
so i think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and so@@ lic@@ it it , particularly from friends .
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our hi@@ stories .
we &apos;re being ad@@ vis@@ ed by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
finger , finger , finger , pin@@ k or finger .
they say , &quot; go away . &quot;
and one of the most beautiful descri@@ p@@ tions i &apos;ve come across in this research of how minds inter@@ pen@@ et@@ rate was written by a great theor@@ ist and scientist named dou@@ glas ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter at the university of indi@@ ana .
and yet , in the contro@@ ls there were three .
than@@ k@@ fully , a few years ago , things shif@@ ted for me because i heard this gent@@ le@@ man speak , dr. mu@@ ham@@ mad y@@ un@@ us .
what is the wall mostly made of ? atoms .
just up the road .
and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue , but to go to where the other be@@ es go .
&quot; first they ignor@@ e you , then they lau@@ gh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot;
so to start , i want to introduce some charac@@ ters from a book i made for teenagers .
so i started asking all my friends , please take your favorite ted@@ talk and put that into six words .
like the ber@@ mu@@ da tri@@ ang@@ le , nobody ever repor@@ ts back from there .
and so what the buil@@ der will get is every single individual part that has been cu@@ st@@ om manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red off@@ -@@ site and delivered on a truck to the site , to that buil@@ der , and a set of these instru@@ ction manu@@ als .
there &apos;s a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
but it &apos;s not perfect yet , it &apos;s very much a work in progress .
we &apos;ve met ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons all over the public sector ke@@ en to make these kinds of differences .
now to a vege@@ table plant , my apart@@ ment has got to be about as foreign as ou@@ ter space .
and so you can see this current coming up -- in this case , the hum@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t current -- that comes all the way out to the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos islands , and this deep under@@ sea current , the cro@@ m@@ well current , that up@@ w@@ ells around the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
we don &apos;t have any in@@ cen@@ tive to go and resol@@ ve it across the u.s .
every few minutes , the video p@@ aus@@ es and the students get asked a question .
those girls have never touched google .
this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
ga@@ vin pre@@ tor@@ -@@ pin@@ ney : clou@@ dy with a chance of joy
the average american sp@@ ends 19 percent of their income on their car , and there &apos;s a pressure for them to reduce that cost , yet they have no out@@ let today .
once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a mat@@ ri@@ x .
you know , this is probably how the ocean looked here one or 200 years ago , but nobody was around to tell us .
and she looks back and does this , &quot; i know . &quot;
but then we hit a new challenge , and that &apos;s the number of sk@@ ill@@ ed pros@@ the@@ ti@@ sts who are able to fit kne@@ es .
y@@ ours is faith .
it &apos;s called &quot; ti@@ dying up art &quot; and it &apos;s , as you can see , it &apos;s more or less a picture book .
so , it &apos;s a very ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous environment , with co as well , and many other gas@@ es .
and this radi@@ cal pro@@ pos@@ al has a profound impact on this my@@ ster@@ y : the amount of dark energy reve@@ aled by the no@@ bel pri@@ ze@@ -@@ winning results .
the li@@ mp@@ op@@ o sun gets really hot in winter .
tremendous and beautiful discovery .
what did they spend it on ?
and i remember years later , i was writing about my mother , and i asked her , &quot; why did you c@@ ry then ? &quot;
why not eat insects ? well first , what are insects ?
i was deci@@ de@@ dly un@@ happy ; a girl didn &apos;t mar@@ ry me .
so we got more money this year to carry on colle@@ cting more and more sam@@ ples .
the often dent@@ al con@@ son@@ ant of no indo-@@ european language .
you have to make it yourself .
anyone would glo@@ m onto a crimin@@ al justice system that has this kind of a record .
i live cy@@ cles of light and dar@@ k@@ ness .
now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assem@@ bly h@@ all .
so . thank you very much .
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is fail@@ ing . &quot;
now we looked at the clouds above this forest ; we looked at the re@@ forest@@ ation area , the se@@ mi@@ -@@ open area and the open area .
that tiny mis@@ al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment .
but this is exactly what i did because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terror@@ ist , and why she &apos;d never tried to rec@@ ru@@ it me .
but i feel bl@@ ess@@ ed to be able to work with them .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of re@@ stor@@ ing perfect hearing .
and only if your per cap@@ it@@ a income is above 6@@ ,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water .
now if i place the mouse cur@@ s@@ or over it , this is what we call a comm@@ and pro@@ mp@@ t , and using this we can navi@@ gate around the computer .
and we &apos;re getting great repor@@ ts back from corporate ghana , corporate west africa , and the things that they &apos;re most im@@ pres@@ sed about is work eth@@ ic .
and i &apos;m going to share one of these studies with you today .
some people have the mis@@ gui@@ ded idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritu@@ al things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , conf@@ ess@@ ing or doing something like that .
how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
all right , how many swe@@ dis@@ h decisi@@ on@@ ma@@ kers and politi@@ cians and business leaders use , every day , u.@@ s@@ .-@@ based services , like , you know , run windows or os@@ x , or use facebook or lin@@ ke@@ d@@ in , or store their data in clouds like ic@@ lou@@ d or sky@@ drive or drop@@ box , or maybe use online services like ama@@ zon web services or sal@@ es support ?
in the same way that when i see tree moves , then i imagine that tree making a ru@@ st@@ ling sound .
rd : sure .
in my rema@@ ining four minutes today , i can offer just a few sugge@@ sti@@ ons .
just as all car@@ bs are not bad for you , all f@@ ats are not bad for you . there are good f@@ ats .
we live in a galaxy , the mil@@ k@@ y way galaxy .
and so we left my father fast as@@ le@@ ep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by her@@ self , and we get in the car .
and again , we had to fly to the jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock .
i &apos;d like to say i don &apos;t know .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular rou@@ te that i had taken , the re@@ mot@@ er the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
he just got ti@@ red of being in front of an audience , and felt like -- a per@@ forming mon@@ key was , in fact , his term .
r@@ b : yes , i mean , we &apos;ve got -- we &apos;re setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
there &apos;s another way that or@@ gas@@ m might bo@@ ost fer@@ tili@@ ty .
they made a lot of mista@@ kes .
it &apos;s about the same as y@@ ours and mine .
kt : ok , ok , ok . oh , my god !
because remember , in my sc@@ oring system , they have to reach a min@@ imum threshold of 7@@ 00 points , and none of them have done that .
and it &apos;s kind of constra@@ ined by that circle .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incre@@ mental sort of change .
these people mu@@ dd@@ le up their sen@@ ses .
my sister was strug@@ gl@@ ing to get through under@@ grad .
the song is just a given , that &apos;s how you have to think about it .
one thing we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think is that compassion makes you mis@@ er@@ able .
now this may sound ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t , or even full of hu@@ br@@ is .
and the third boy said , &quot; frank sent this . &quot;
and when her carbon cop@@ i@@ ed questi@@ on@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jum@@ ped out with the statisti@@ cal cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
now we &apos;re making scot@@ tish tar@@ t@@ ans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of scot@@ tish ancestors .
again , give each species what it wants , let it realize its des@@ ires , its physi@@ ological distin@@ cti@@ veness .
once scientists became members of a professional group , they were slowly w@@ alled off from the rest of us .
right ? we norm@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ certain@@ ty . when he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
some who understood the project would explain it to others .
it takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is gener@@ ating enorm@@ ous amo@@ unts of information that comes out of the machine .
and so there &apos;s actually a fourth thing that we have not get to , that we won &apos;t see in the next 10 years , or 5,000 days , but i think that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to . and as the internet of things -- where i &apos;m lin@@ king directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane -- that that physical thing becomes part of the web .
but we have to practice .
thank you .
the reason , he told me , was something called post part@@ um he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
tex@@ ting , email , po@@ sting , all of these things let us present the self as we want to be .
some people -- i &apos;ve got an english friend in china , and he said , &quot; the contin@@ ent is sle@@ ep@@ walking into obli@@ vi@@ on . &quot;
and speaking of values , i &apos;ve noticed that in the discussion about moral per@@ su@@ asi@@ on online , and when i &apos;m talking with people , more often than not there is a weird bi@@ as .
and then all be@@ ts are off .
because i challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don &apos;t have cro@@ p diversity .
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society &apos;s evolution -- like , what do we want to be when we grow up , when we move past this bu@@ m@@ bling adol@@ escence where we think there are no limit@@ s and suff@@ er del@@ u@@ sions of im@@ mortality ?
you know , take a look at his face .
these are now two years out .
the gang had no way to make money .
we were risk ta@@ kers , of course .
and there was an interaction between diplom@@ acy and the power coming bot@@ tom@@ -up .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental de@@ gra@@ dation and climate change .
so these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
the answer is , not a lot .
&quot; without a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , i met you first last tu@@ es@@ day mor@@ n .
i said , &quot; it would have to show up free . &quot;
and i have to say , many of them now in the professional or@@ che@@ str@@ as throughout the world .
i have a very rela@@ tivi@@ stic view of security .
it &apos;s a powerful way of solving in@@ tra@@ c@@ table problems using natural selec@@ tion .
and most recently , neuro@@ physi@@ ological meas@@ ures have shown that people who pun@@ ish che@@ at@@ ers in economic games show activity in the re@@ ward cent@@ ers of their brain .
but , the whole point is that india is the national@@ ism of an idea .
i &apos;m the &quot; why &quot; guy . i want to know why you do what you do .
so you take a ch@@ un@@ k of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics .
we need to use less to make more .
so 96 percent is as good as 100 percent .
it &apos;s plastic pollution .
it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules -- or to my taste , new drugs for cancer .
i also translate weather data into musi@@ cal sc@@ or@@ es .
and that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .
i thought my sk@@ ein of hung@@ arian ment@@ ors had come to an end , but almost immediately i met fran@@ cis ro@@ bi@@ c@@ se@@ k , a hung@@ arian doctor -- actually a heart surgeon in char@@ lot@@ te , north car@@ ol@@ ina , then in his late se@@ venti@@ es -- who had been a pion@@ e@@ er in open-@@ heart surgery , and , tin@@ ker@@ ing away in his garage behind his house , had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those proce@@ dur@@ es .
please raise your hand high right now . ok .
every morning we wake up and re@@ ga@@ in consciousness -- that is a mar@@ vel@@ ous fact -- but what exactly is it that we re@@ ga@@ in ? neurosci@@ enti@@ st ant@@ oni@@ o dam@@ asi@@ o uses this simple question to give us a glimp@@ se into how our brains create our sense of self .
so she is just one am@@ ong@@ st the millions who are blind .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of the work we do is due to l@@ ack of r@@ out@@ ine ma@@ inten@@ ance , the sort of things that happen in all our houses .
i think there &apos;s a belief that it &apos;s just impossible , that you cannot quanti@@ fy the do@@ ings of man@@ kind , that you cannot measure history .
they went to uruguay , per@@ u , mexico .
we did not know about this life system .
but let &apos;s go back to the hig@@ gs field .
it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang , but gives us no insi@@ ght into what would have powered the bang itself .
non@@ eth@@ eless , that &apos;s how it was pres@@ ented , and at trial nobody even argu@@ ed it .
that &apos;s a magnifi@@ er times 10 .
so when the fish control the ur@@ ch@@ in population , the ocean was re@@ stor@@ ed to its natural equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
what about the electron@@ ic revolution ?
while r@@ inging in hospital staff &apos;s tic tac@@ s , i &apos;d cas@@ ually ask , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
we give you the best tools , the best tools , and now , do it .
that is the reason why i felt it was im@@ per@@ ative that i pres@@ ented you with this copy of the ga@@ y agenda .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no ade@@ qu@@ ate san@@ it@@ ation .
basic windows functions , brow@@ sing , painting , chat@@ ting and email , games and edu@@ ca@@ tional material , music down@@ lo@@ ads , playing video .
as i open@@ ed my leg , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ rying a kni@@ fe .
i &apos;m also very hopeful that in the next decades , we will make big stri@@ des on redu@@ cing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease .
it evol@@ ves .
and then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier .
and both require silence of some sort .
god himself was ut@@ ter@@ ly familiar from his earlier mani@@ fest@@ ation as ya@@ h@@ we@@ h -- je@@ al@@ ously insi@@ sting on no other go@@ ds .
how much learning can you do ?
a few months later , i went back to uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner , mat@@ the@@ w , and i had kind of built , and took pictures of seven of my new friends , po@@ sted their stories , these stories of entrepreneur@@ ship , up on the website , sp@@ am@@ med friends and family and said , &quot; we think this is legal .
we all chat@@ ter with our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps .
i saw a man@@ ta ray that looked as big as the plane i was flying in .
when the star@@ link disaster happened , there was a bat@@ tle between the ep@@ a and the fda over who really had auth@@ ority , and over what parts of this , and they didn &apos;t get it stra@@ igh@@ tened out for months . that &apos;s kind of crazy .
and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done , what has been done , how the world has rema@@ ined both in between st@@ ability and inst@@ ability .
and this is really important when you begin to look at animals .
pri@@ ces stabili@@ zed , so people could plan their economic lives .
i &apos;m going to tell you about why i became a sculp@@ tor , and you may think that sculp@@ tors , well , they deal with met@@ a , they deal with objects , they deal with bodies , but i think , really , what i care about most is making space , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve called this talk : making space .
i certainly haven &apos;t .
and when i try to explain my work to her , she wa@@ ved away all the deta@@ ils , and she said , &quot; neil , there &apos;s only one question that really matters .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
one hundred billion str@@ ands of magne@@ tic field inside this three-@@ inch dis@@ k .
another well studied sound are ech@@ olo@@ cation cli@@ cks .
i can cut any way i want to , so i cut right here .
i had never used a computer .
but at one time , it was fairly com@@ mon@@ place to think of yourself as a maker .
i think it &apos;s really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
and i &apos;m very aware that when you say the word &quot; god , &quot; many people will turn off immediately .
vision was re@@ fin@@ ed in hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e cr@@ ab@@ s , among the first to leave the sea .
when our super@@ markets have only two or three days &apos; worth of food in them at any one time , often sustain@@ ability ten@@ ds to focus on the energy effici@@ ency of the free@@ z@@ ers and on the pack@@ aging that the le@@ t@@ tu@@ ces are wr@@ apped up in .
there &apos;s one particular curious meme which i rather en@@ joy .
the reason for that is really very simple .
in this hu@@ b@@ ble image , we see two galaxies .
at that moment i was less and less human , i was also , at the same time , maybe the most human i &apos;ve ever been .
and at that population level , our planet will be de@@ aling with the limit@@ s of growth .
you could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could sh@@ ine a non@@ le@@ th@@ al laser on the bug before you za@@ p it , and you could listen to the wing be@@ at frequ@@ ency and you could measure the size .
so what they &apos;re saying is that drug users are consum@@ ers too , so they have this in their neur@@ al path@@ ways .
and for the rest of your life , every time you hear classi@@ cal music , you &apos;ll always be able to know if you hear those impul@@ ses .
medical conditions don &apos;t ne@@ gate the human condition .
and suddenly you &apos;re getting ama@@ zon , as a brand , is going head to head with the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve in terms of how you want to spend your money , what money is , what con@@ stit@@ utes money .
but as you go and you look closer at a tree , what you see is , you see increasing complexity .
in fact , the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word pros@@ per@@ ity .
this can be impro@@ ved upon in so many ways so quickly . &quot;
so think about , this is in your brain .
and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body : they &apos;re ab@@ normal ; they &apos;re very poor@@ ly constru@@ cted ; and , because of that , they &apos;re highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .
this is a bus , or vehicle , for a char@@ ity , for an n@@ go that wants to double the education budget in the united states -- car@@ efully designed , so , by two in@@ ches , it still cle@@ ars highway over@@ pass@@ es .
but once it arrived , if no bu@@ yer was to be found , or if pri@@ ces suddenly dropped , farmers would in@@ cu@@ r tremendous los@@ ses .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m ga@@ y . that &apos;s not the direction that i &apos;m headed in .
well , with the pig , at the bas@@ el@@ ine , before we blo@@ cked the pig &apos;s ar@@ tery to simu@@ late a heart attack , that was the signal .
i &apos;m doing yo@@ g@@ a and ta@@ i ch@@ i to improve my balance , so that when i start to lose it , i &apos;ll still be able to be mobile .
that is the most p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic number you can have .
that &apos;s why sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are puts all that stuff in ham@@ let -- you know , op@@ hel@@ ia going mad and the play within the play , and yor@@ i@@ ck &apos;s sk@@ ull , and the gra@@ ve@@ dig@@ gers .
but when you take a close look , you start to see the holes , and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways .
and so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it .
so we pil@@ ed into a tax@@ i , and this is our tax@@ i driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; where are you going ? &quot;
they arri@@ ve first .
we think in narra@@ tive structures .
but , the future -- we can now tell who &apos;s going to get type ii diabetes from all the common vari@@ ants , and that &apos;s going to get filled in more with low-@@ frequ@@ ency vari@@ ants in the future .
now we had to start changing these people and conver@@ ting them from using that for a li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood , to getting something else .
every time the di@@ atoms rep@@ licate , they give the genetic information that says , &quot; here &apos;s how to build glass in the ocean that &apos;s perfectly nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
as i say , every home should have a scanning electr@@ on micros@@ cope to be able to see these .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light len@@ sed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shado@@ w and really not notice that anything drama@@ tic had happened .
it &apos;s this per@@ v@@ asi@@ veness , combined with the cent@@ r@@ ality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history .
he lost no worse than most people do .
so arch@@ ie spli@@ ts the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sa@@ ti@@ ation .
i &apos;m much more trying to add to some of the questions we &apos;re talking about .
and 50 percent of the e@@ u budget is going to subsi@@ di@@ ze agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have over@@ produced .
now i &apos;ve come to the con@@ clu@@ sion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don &apos;t have a problem of economics , technology and public policy .
this electric h@@ ush , as if they could sense what was about to happen .
it becomes the rain@@ storm .
if you just p@@ lot how much fuel we &apos;ve got left , in units of present world consumption .
so , microsoft -- this is a project that -- worldwide telescope is de@@ di@@ cated to jim gray , who &apos;s our collea@@ gue , and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible .
but her suffering is equal to mine .
they &apos;re en@@ rich@@ ing others , not out of altru@@ ism but as a way of en@@ rich@@ ing themselves .
i &apos;ll roll that for you now . this was the first test for benjam@@ in button .
so we get this .
you can &apos;t fix that problem without add@@ res@@ sing sh@@ ame , because when they teach those folks how to su@@ ture , they also teach them how to stit@@ ch their self-@@ worth to being all-@@ powerful .
how do we make an election system completely ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able while keeping the vot@@ es absolutely secret ?
we also produce media for dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation to the public -- free through the cy@@ ar@@ k website .
the entire aid flo@@ ws to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion .
and this is such an in@@ version , and such a wonderful example of children being the ag@@ ents of change .
you should be looking for the perfect pe@@ p@@ sis . &quot;
imagine , with somebody who &apos;s lost their whole arm , we still have four major ner@@ ves that go down your arm .
but being less di@@ verse is not necessarily good for our health .
and i realized , oh my god . this is what i &apos;ve been doing for 20 years .
&quot; sh@@ h@@ h . &quot;
now it &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able that this has all got inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed over hundreds of years .
they actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like low-@@ threshold peri@@ pher@@ al activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bon@@ ding social capital that we &apos;re l@@ ac@@ king . and very , very quickly -- i love puppe@@ ts . here &apos;s a puppe@@ t .
em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ism is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate because , well , scientific theor@@ ies explain the seen in terms of the un@@ seen .
i &apos;m so used to that .
this is quite remarkable , because , again , why did no one look at this before ?
so all in all , that &apos;s going very well .
that can be very embar@@ rass@@ ing .
so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds .
and so then we read his blog , which was getting -- you know , sort of going from bad to worse , and we said the related search was , &quot; re@@ tar@@ ds . &quot;
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i river , and yet it &apos;s only a min@@ or feature on chron@@ os .
right now , earth is the only planet still that we know is te@@ em@@ ing with life .
the other belie@@ ves this is one of many lives .
use science to , you know , work back@@ wards and say , &quot; well , really , what were they thinking ? &quot;
in kur@@ zwei@@ lian terms i &apos;m like the ee@@ yor@@ e of economic growth .
what does the system look like ?
we &apos;re not the first ones to make paper . we &apos;re not the first ones to try to optimi@@ ze pac@@ king space , or to water@@ pro@@ of , or to try to heat and cool a structure .
and apollo was one of the greatest motiv@@ ators ever .
it &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; what ? &quot;
one day , i was fac@@ ed fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with chr@@ ist .
now , why would a phan@@ tom li@@ m@@ b be paraly@@ zed ?
it was the fact she was going so slow .
what really matters is basically to manipu@@ late the emo@@ tions of the people .
but she went into cro@@ ch@@ et over@@ drive .
so something can be done , even in such extreme environments as afghanistan .
a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , &quot; love and compassion are ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ties .
tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known i should .
anyway , the question i think people should talk about -- and it &apos;s absolutely tab@@ o@@ o -- is , how many people should there be ?
the important point is that these same amp@@ li@@ fying feed@@ bac@@ ks will occu@@ r today .
so not just hon@@ ey , most of the mon@@ keys went with guys who had more .
they want to be self -- they want to self-@@ police themselves .
the last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the ab@@ stra@@ ct descri@@ ption to the fol@@ ded shape -- that &apos;s hard .
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -- things like your family relationships , friend@@ ship , community , values -- then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in poli@@ tics .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
what if it is the equivalent , depen@@ ding on where you are , of the grand can@@ al , in terms of tou@@ ri@@ sts , hab@@ it@@ ation , des@@ al@@ ination , agriculture ?
or should i leave the piece int@@ act as it is right now ? &quot;
these are the two species of spi@@ ders for which the vast majority of time and money on syn@@ thetic spi@@ der sil@@ k research has been to rep@@ licate their dra@@ gl@@ ine sil@@ k proteins .
that little issue took the team two years to solve .
they &apos;ve been here for billions of years , and what they are are sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed micros@@ cop@@ ic organis@@ ms .
for 2@@ 8 years , den@@ ise her@@ zing has spent five months each summer living with a po@@ d of atlan@@ tic sp@@ ot@@ ted dolphins , following three generations of family relationships and behaviors . it &apos;s clear they are communic@@ ating with one another -- but is it language ? could humans use it too ? she shar@@ es a fascinating new experiment to test this idea .
could we le@@ verage the clou@@ d ?
now that doesn &apos;t mean they only get half their education , but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what &apos;s going on .
and he &apos;s here also today .
j@@ m : thank you all .
that &apos;s me , getting a nas@@ al la@@ v@@ age .
my one year turned into six years : thousands of stories , hundreds of long interviews , focus groups .
super@@ organis@@ ms have proper@@ ties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals .
and now i get to teach her how things work , and we get to build projects together , and i wonder what kind of lessons that she &apos;ll learn from them .
and this can be a problem , as i learned .
thank you . all right .
fire@@ works dis@@ plays , the sm@@ ell of per@@ fu@@ me : no .
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
we created public pen@@ sions .
so heart is fil@@ tered out , so i can see if i &apos;m curious about that .
and i ended up in a town called fra@@ ck@@ ville .
at age 3@@ 1 -- that &apos;s my age now -- in aug@@ ust i took two weeks to re-@@ exam@@ ine swimming , and question all the of the obvious aspe@@ cts of swimming .
and if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that tor@@ que , we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly fac@@ ing situ@@ ations which are simply un@@ thin@@ k@@ able .
and this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that i think can deli@@ ver that vision when you &apos;re out and about on the street talking to people and so forth .
and you can sc@@ roll around and see some of the different air@@ por@@ ts and the different patterns that they have .
so if i take this salt d@@ ough , again , it &apos;s like the pla@@ y-@@ d@@ ough you probably made as kids , and i plu@@ g it in -- it &apos;s a two-@@ lead battery pack , simple battery pack , you can buy them at radio sh@@ ack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up .
but the men had a better idea .
well , the best example i know is a study of 7@@ 9@@ ,000 men follo@@ wed over 20 years , in which it was found that men who consum@@ ed coo@@ ked tom@@ at@@ o@@ es two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent redu@@ ction in their risk of developing prostate cancer .
and then i was a mas@@ se@@ use . and then i was a landscape gar@@ den@@ er .
you understood exactly what i just said in english .
i hope you all realize that .
if you go and search on something -- this is goo@@ gle@@ .com , the different versions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an al@@ ph@@ a rel@@ ease , and this is what it looked like at stanford .
and i had a ma@@ c classi@@ c . and it &apos;s a little box .
infrastructure at that large scale is also inse@@ par@@ able from communication .
thank you for having me .
i ema@@ iled charlie and steve cou@@ s@@ ins of wil@@ low garage , and we formed the robots for humanity project .
no , not at all , no problem , take your time .
i &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
what &apos;s the context of this me@@ al ?
in this gu@@ ise of living object approach , i like the idea of a kind of invisible design , as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves .
i believe we focus on the lines that cross bor@@ ders , the infrastructure lines .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into exist@@ ence , full of a strange kind of energy -- in@@ fla@@ tionary energy -- which ble@@ w it up .
these are the cars .
it &apos;s 27 kilometers in cir@@ cum@@ ference .
but it has been ama@@ zingly successful in one reg@@ ard , in that it has become , it has con@@ ge@@ aled into this endangered people &apos;s movement that was missing in the 20@@ th century .
it goes on . we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york . the board of ed@@ . had no idea .
i stayed thri@@ ll@@ ed until i got home , thre@@ w the hel@@ met onto my bed , fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an in@@ scri@@ ption .
simple a@@ war@@ en@@ ess is where it beg@@ ins .
r@@ ory stewart : why democracy matters
you know , think of the fast food industry , the drug industry , the ban@@ king industry .
am : in these ?
but three days seemed to be the opti@@ m@@ um amount .
people think they &apos;re sort of low@@ bro@@ ws .
i hope you guys recognize it .
electrical pul@@ ses form the thoughts in our brains .
you can deri@@ ve many ideas from that .
and there &apos;s this huge hu@@ b@@ bu@@ b .
and also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even res@@ ent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad .
and i &apos;ll be honest , all i wanted was for him to not be angry at me .
thank you so much , prime minister , that was both fascinating and quite in@@ spir@@ ing .
they , in fact , told me three weeks .
here is the green one .
now , have a look at that . that &apos;s the anes@@ thesi@@ ology machine .
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m contin@@ ually ama@@ zed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world &apos;s population can go online to learn , to create and to share .
the behavi@@ oral economist george lo@@ wen@@ stein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate k@@ is@@ s from a cele@@ bri@@ ty , any cele@@ bri@@ ty .
maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies be@@ have .
but this brought me -- with ne@@ tra man@@ aging my career -- it brought me a lot of success .
50 companies signed up , 200 products came out , gener@@ ated 100 million in sal@@ es .
if your ene@@ my was really happy , why would they bo@@ ther to be your ene@@ my ?
when i became president in 199@@ 3 , there were none of these organizations in russia .
because he can &apos;t see him .
and she said , &quot; i want to write a case , eu@@ vin -- a case on a publi@@ c@@ -@@ sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world . &quot;
k and because of that , a@@ h@@ me@@ dab@@ ad is known as india &apos;s first chil@@ d-@@ friendly city .
so this technology push , a demographic ki@@ ck from a new generation and a dem@@ and pull from a new economic global environment is caus@@ ing the world to open up .
it &apos;s taken off the deli@@ very truck .
all throughout the technology world , we &apos;re seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndro@@ me .
she &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
but , having had a father with heart disease , and reali@@ zing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten , and having a good friend step in to help , i really believe that all people deser@@ ve access to health at pri@@ ces they can afford .
so , &quot; we cannot stay here , it &apos;s dangerous .
there are only 16 different pieces of wood , only 16 different assem@@ bly parts here .
but let me war@@ n you , these are th@@ a@@ i@@ -@@ si@@ zed , so be very care@@ ful .
we didn &apos;t really realize that until 19@@ 14 , when the last passen@@ ger pi@@ geon , a female named mar@@ th@@ a , died at the cin@@ c@@ inn@@ at@@ i zoo .
but it &apos;s important to remember that before we learned how to share the fru@@ its of the industrial revolution with the bro@@ ad s@@ wa@@ thes of society , we had to go through two depres@@ sions , the great depression of the 193@@ 0s , the long depression of the 18@@ 7@@ 0s , two world wars , commun@@ ist revolu@@ tions in russia and in china , and an era of tremendous social and political up@@ hea@@ val in the west .
it &apos;s 16 , 16 , 16 , 48 , 4@@ ,@@ 800 -- 4@@ ,@@ 800 , the answer to the sum .
and we &apos;re very lucky in ir@@ eland , we have pl@@ enty of bas@@ king sharks and pl@@ enty of opportunities to study them .
i had wo@@ ven carbon fi@@ ber spr@@ in@@ ting legs mod@@ eled after the hind leg of a che@@ e@@ ta@@ h , which you may have seen on stage yesterday .
no scho@@ ol@@ ing was possible for him , except a few weeks here , a few weeks there .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
thank you .
another photo that has great@@ ly influ@@ enced me , or a series of photos , is this project that &apos;s done by an argent@@ ine@@ an man and his wife .
now my stories are not the stories that you &apos;ll hear on the news , and while it &apos;s true that africa is a har@@ sh place , i also know it to be a place where people , animals and ec@@ osystems teach us about a more inter@@ connected world .
and this is exactly what you expected , isn &apos;t it ?
do you want to go for a wee@@ k@@ end to ro@@ me ?
it was a slow , cum@@ ber@@ some process that depen@@ ded on chicken eg@@ gs , millions of living chicken eg@@ gs .
one of many different techniques using wireless sensors .
and they wouldn &apos;t let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn &apos;t come back .
un@@ rel@@ at@@ ed@@ ly -- japan is doing crazy things with toile@@ ts .
today &apos;s its de@@ but .
so there &apos;s a basic line for people . and also , it can be changed .
and in particular , one area of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be is called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ rus .
there &apos;s another thing , which is you &apos;ve got to get these genes into cells .
kit@@ es : i &apos;m going to give you a brief history , and tell you about the magnificent future of every child &apos;s favorite play@@ thing .
we team@@ ed designers and investment exper@@ ts up with 11 water organizations across india .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping defin@@ e the whole experience from the inside out .
a lot of people are worried about what is ration@@ ality about ?
no job , no money , no security , no pros@@ pe@@ ct . &quot;
but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expec@@ tancy , we &apos;re also concerned about the quality of life lived .
that &apos;s clearly enjo@@ y@@ able for myself .
he didn &apos;t actually buy anything , just some data .
now let &apos;s zo@@ om in on it here , so we can see it in more detail .
but particularly here in america , we are poll@@ u@@ ting so much because we &apos;re thro@@ wing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway , then these two problems would seem to share the same solution , which is to make our cities more wal@@ k@@ able .
our research often starts with a very simple question .
they have evolved over mil@@ len@@ nia .
every once in a while , i have to say , &quot; ah , fu@@ ck it . &quot;
it &apos;s called can@@ non@@ au .
it &apos;s a problem across the developing world , and in middle income countries too . in ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a , for example -- look at ja@@ mai@@ can members of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent , you meet them , and they &apos;re often people who are r@@ ho@@ des sch@@ ol@@ ars , who &apos;ve studied at har@@ vard or at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on , and yet , you go down to down@@ town king@@ ston , and you are looking at one of the most depres@@ sing sites that you can see in any midd@@ le-@@ income country in the world : a dis@@ mal , depres@@ sing landscape of bur@@ nt and hal@@ f-@@ ab@@ and@@ oned buildings .
i &apos;ll go through the three basic con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations .
with body language , here &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do .
so if there &apos;s a problem with a shor@@ tage of baby@@ si@@ tters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the v@@ et@@ ting and training , an invest@@ or can pay for it and the system will ti@@ the back the en@@ han@@ ced ear@@ n@@ ings of the individuals for maybe the next two years .
this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year .
that was a big deal ; that was important . he worked for ko@@ da@@ k for a while ; that was important .
and about five years ago , we asked what was the most important need for innovation in scho@@ ol@@ ing here in the u.@@ k .
and it actually causes your car to char@@ ge sa@@ f@@ ely and effici@@ ently .
it tells a story . the story can reach into ob@@ sc@@ ure des@@ ires .
i have no staff ; it &apos;s all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
they cover us in an invisible body ar@@ mor that keeps environmental insu@@ l@@ ts out so that we stay healthy .
we should take our foot off the pe@@ dal right now , and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years .
so they have more de@@ bt and worse friend@@ ships than they had before they won the lot@@ tery .
don &apos;t they just po@@ p into your head ?
i feel a clos@@ en@@ ess to this cho@@ ir -- almost like a family .
the second point is about the ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of tiny actions .
by combin@@ ing tissue engineering techniques with micro@@ flu@@ i@@ di@@ cs , the field is actually evol@@ ving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your li@@ ver or an anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant might affect your heart .
we can do this . don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
what are these terms ?
that &apos;s not the way history works .
my gir@@ l@@ friend at the time , who &apos;s no longer my gir@@ l@@ friend — — hat@@ ed it .
in the developing world , access to in@@ cu@@ bat@@ ors is limited by cost and distance , and millions of pre@@ mat@@ ure babies die each year . fellow jan@@ e chen shows an invention that could keep millions of these in@@ fan@@ ts warm -- a design that &apos;s safe , port@@ able , low-@@ cost and life@@ -@@ saving .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the ch@@ amp@@ s-@@ el@@ y@@ se@@ es .
in some other countries , the o@@ ec@@ d conven@@ tion is not yet proper@@ ly en@@ forced .
it &apos;s not like i can just check it in the lab .
so that &apos;s what the mi@@ dden workers do .
in the afgh@@ an section in london responsible for gover@@ ning afgh@@ an policy on the ground , i was told last year that there was not a single staff me@@ mber of the foreign office in that section who had ever ser@@ ved on a po@@ sting in afghanistan .
what all administra@@ tions say when there &apos;s a sc@@ and@@ al .
what has happened is this : that china is growing , it &apos;s not so equal any longer , and it &apos;s appe@@ aring here , over@@ looking the united states .
okay . you are the people to wh@@ om my talk will be of practical value .
he studies the brain using mri , and he cla@@ im@@ s that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scan@@ ned .
pa@@ ol@@ o car@@ din@@ i : forget multi@@ tasking , try mon@@ ot@@ asking
we started to do pe@@ t scans , ee@@ gs and genetic analysis to see where the bad news is .
what we did -- be@@ tty rap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and i -- was actually to give the babies two bow@@ ls of food : one bowl of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bowl of deli@@ cious gol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ ck@@ ers .
in the hands of the ted community , these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world , but in the hands of su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bom@@ bers , the future can look quite different .
there have been remarkable advan@@ ces in understanding the brain , but how do you actually study the neurons inside it ? using gor@@ ge@@ ous ima@@ gery , neurosci@@ enti@@ st and fellow car@@ l scho@@ on@@ over shows the tools that let us see inside our brains .
to understand what that means , let &apos;s look at the lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ based class@@ room , and let &apos;s pick the medi@@ an per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as a threshold .
and we also sam@@ pl@@ ed the out@@ door air .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asi@@ an person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
what do you like ? dark , rich , hear@@ ty ro@@ ast !
&quot; for s@@ ale : white tr@@ ash comp@@ ac@@ tor . &quot;
there are some other book@@ mobil@@ es running around .
because this is treating your audience like a mor@@ on .
dr. v : see , mcdonald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple .
and i think that this is really the orig@@ in of what you and i call &quot; love at first si@@ ght . &quot;
all of these speak@@ ers , by the way , are young women , 18 or 19 years old .
i can run , and now you can go to school .
and it was the cu@@ st@@ om of those fl@@ an@@ eur@@ s to show they were men of lei@@ sure by taking tur@@ t@@ les for wal@@ ks and le@@ tting the rep@@ tile set the pace .
and perhaps the clear@@ est example of this is st@@ on@@ ing adul@@ ter@@ ers .
if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipl@@ ine of flying .
so this kind of tra@@ cks me at any given moment .
well actually , you are going to whist@@ le along .
this is an ad for m@@ t@@ n , which is a south african mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional active in about 25 countries , and when they came into nigeria — nigeria is the big dog in africa .
we walked into the off@@ ices of the m@@ uni@@ cip@@ al corpor@@ ation , the police , the press , businesses , and basically said , &quot; when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resi@@ des in every child ?
but the fis@@ hes , as i say , are the best known .
it co@@ sts us , like , 20 dollars a month just for ho@@ sting .
bat@@ s as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years .
that &apos;s social . let &apos;s look at education .
mar@@ cin ja@@ ku@@ bow@@ sk@@ i : open-@@ sour@@ ced blue@@ prin@@ ts for civilization
we put suff@@ o@@ cation war@@ n@@ ings on all the -- on every piece of plastic film manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in the united states or for s@@ ale with an it@@ em in the united states .
now , it &apos;s about 35 percent .
we have 10,000 times more of that spectrum , which is there for us to use .
this is very difficult , and you have to have a b@@ ond with your team that per@@ mit@@ s you to do this , because their life is wr@@ apped up in that too .
and i was required to answer : a. i have never had a genetic test , b. i &apos;ve had one , here you go , and c. i &apos;ve had one and i &apos;m not telling .
you miss the real patterns . you don &apos;t want to be too skep@@ tical .
so here , to follow my cards , i must look at the shu@@ ff@@ le from the begin -- ah , we are started together . it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
so , everybody &apos;s always suggesting new hum@@ ble ma@@ ster@@ pieces , and at mom@@ a we put out some books just for people to suggest their own hum@@ ble ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
i think this aff@@ ir@@ ms something that &apos;s long been known by diplom@@ ats -- nam@@ ely , that the va@@ gu@@ en@@ ess of language , far from being a bug or an im@@ perfe@@ ction , actually might be a feature of language , one that we use to our advantage in social inter@@ actions .
about the same time , she was going to take two students to a lea@@ der@@ ship conference in lar@@ am@@ ie , which is a couple of hours away , and she was going to drive them in her car , but the school said , &quot; no , you can &apos;t drive them in the car for li@@ ability reasons .
and then finally , c@@ ag@@ at@@ ay ev@@ y@@ ap@@ an , aka cha@@ 0 -- one of the most remarkable h@@ ack@@ ers ever , from an@@ kar@@ a in tur@@ key .
walk around for four months with three wi@@ sh@@ es , and all the ideas will start to per@@ col@@ ate up .
and mo@@ bility to your dest@@ ination is clearly solved .
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-@@ vision our relationship to past people and events , neur@@ al path@@ ways can change .
he decided to sp@@ ell , or , rather , mis@@ sp@@ ell ra@@ e@@ han with an a-@@ e .
and i ended up in student health , and they ran some lab@@ work and came back right away , and said , &quot; ki@@ d@@ ney problems . &quot;
and if you could see invisible matter , too .
today , though , i &apos;m going to talk about darwin &apos;s other strange in@@ version , which is equ@@ ally puzz@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important .
none of these problems are real .
then i made a san@@ it@@ ary pad and hand@@ ed it to sh@@ ant@@ i -- my wife &apos;s name is sh@@ ant@@ i .
in this case , it &apos;s ye@@ ast , but ye@@ ast is lea@@ ven . what does lea@@ ven mean ?
they -- in fact , they don &apos;t update or up@@ keep ligh@@ thou@@ ses anymore , and lor@@ an , the only back@@ up to gps , was dis@@ continued last year .
my sister is chasing someone else . it &apos;s not me .
here &apos;s the little dra@@ wing that tells them how that works -- and that &apos;s what will happen in the end .
i wish this meme would go ex@@ tin@@ ct .
and then on the right is what i re@@ fer to as a foot@@ note pan@@ el .
hope for the best .
and wh@@ ining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .
pra@@ k@@ ash , as many of you know , is the s@@ ans@@ kr@@ it word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of she@@ dding light on some of the deep@@ est my@@ steri@@ es of neurosci@@ ence .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of be@@ au , and the blackaw@@ ton be@@ e project .
but that fourth chap@@ ter always ends with an ex@@ ec@@ ution .
most of our planet does not feel the warm@@ th of the sun .
but , if you look at this p@@ lot , you can see that countries that we think about as very similar actually ex@@ hi@@ bit very different behavior .
thank you .
nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
and on the right you actually see a car@@ o@@ ti@@ d ar@@ tery that was engine@@ ered .
and they took it to washington ; they showed them ; and they &apos;re going to be involved now , watching how these things get absor@@ bed in a number of cities , like atlan@@ ta , where we &apos;re doing trials to see if it really can , in fact , help re-@@ energi@@ ze their down@@ town .
she and i were both very pre@@ gn@@ ant at that time , and my heart just ach@@ ed for her , imag@@ ining how afraid she must be .
now there &apos;s the more urban midd@@ le-@@ class pi@@ ous musli@@ ms who , again , look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition , and they understand that they need to be changed and questi@@ oned and re@@ formed .
now what does that mean ?
it blo@@ cks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways .
so , i went .
in fact , it &apos;s compar@@ able to anything we eat as meat at the moment .
if there &apos;s no solution on the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field , three factors can accoun@@ t for the pre@@ vention of ethnic conflict and civil war , or for sustainable peace afterwards : lea@@ der@@ ship , diplom@@ acy and institu@@ tional design .
vol@@ ant@@ or@@ -@@ like hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , perhaps .
this is just before he got ki@@ cked out by the parks services , for compe@@ ting with the book@@ store there .
we &apos;ve just come out , we &apos;re commer@@ ci@@ ali@@ zing , this year , generation 2.@@ 0 of the mar@@ row min@@ er .
thank you . x@@ ie x@@ ie .
i &apos;m an ig@@ no@@ stic .
they made sure that their lo@@ an reci@@ pi@@ ents were staying up with their pay@@ ments .
this is another sequence of mot@@ ts &apos; brain .
and so now we go onto en@@ cel@@ adu@@ s . en@@ cel@@ adu@@ s is a small moon , it &apos;s about a tent@@ h the size of titan . and you can see it here next to england , just to show you the size . this is not meant to be a threat .
so example number one : the internet itself .
and then he said , &quot; no , we can modi@@ fy the work@@ ben@@ ch maybe to put a special sto@@ ol , a special an@@ vi@@ l , special vice , and maybe an electric scre@@ w@@ driver . &quot;
every single debate has been sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed by &quot; clean coal . &quot;
none of us want that , and we all have that in common . so what else do we have in common ?
r@@ g : which is too bad because , of course , it &apos;s a very common and very trau@@ ma@@ tic experience .
today , not so much has changed .
they ate , and he showed me on a ch@@ art , how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their li@@ vers .
let me show you about what it &apos;s like to code in sc@@ rat@@ ch .
looking at what we &apos;re doing today with these machines that we have , we can , just in a few seconds , get 2@@ 4,000 images out of a body , and that would cor@@ respon@@ d to about 20 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data , or 800 phone books , and the pi@@ le would then be 200 meters of phone books .
and then l@@ ately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slo@@ p .
but does this then mean , as many people tend to think , that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people -- on different contin@@ ents , for example ?
it takes eight seconds to do this , and now that that &apos;s done , we can choose a mov@@ ement@@ -@@ based action .
and because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat .
an emo@@ tion , then , creates what we &apos;re going to do or the action .
ok , drop it in .
you just drive to the ne@@ ar@@ est lake , stick your h@@ ose in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
so as i sha@@ ke this ket@@ ch@@ up bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
i would like to quote one of my own house@@ hold go@@ ds .
this was a piece on tour@@ ism in the united states .
and indeed , it &apos;s not just by chance that they &apos;re like them .
the only difference between the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
we can pick up and fly to the deep@@ est place : seven miles down , the mari@@ ana tren@@ ch , where only two people have ever been .
so i actually spend most of my &quot; world 3@@ .@@ 0 &quot; book working through a li@@ t@@ any of market fail@@ ures and fe@@ ars that people have that they worry glob@@ alization is going to exac@@ er@@ bate .
he clos@@ es his eyes .
so now i &apos;m going to show you a number of projects that we &apos;ve built , from one-@@ dimensional , two-@@ dimensional , three-@@ dimensional and even four@@ -@@ dimensional systems .
that &apos;s a complicated problem ; that &apos;s a lot to know .
now , let &apos;s try that again .
internation@@ ally compar@@ able data on life expec@@ tancy , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ acy sc@@ or@@ es , on in@@ f@@ ant mortality rates , hom@@ i@@ ci@@ de rates , propor@@ tion of the population in prison , teen@@ age bir@@ thr@@ ates , levels of trust , o@@ bes@@ ity , mental illness -- which in standard diagno@@ stic classi@@ fication inclu@@ des drug and alco@@ hol addi@@ ction -- and social mo@@ bility .
doctor sel@@ ig@@ man , what is the state of psych@@ ology today ? &quot;
but , his re@@ fin@@ ements were incredible .
and most of all , i think the way that we partici@@ pate in each other &apos;s stories is of deep importance .
the combin@@ ation of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
so what did we learn ?
so i get the im@@ pres@@ sion that some parts of the scientific establi@@ sh@@ ment are mor@@ ph@@ ing into a kind of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
so i did . i went home , i grab@@ bed a pen@@ cil , and i just started le@@ tting my hand sha@@ ke and sha@@ ke .
now , i &apos;d been staying in this room for about three months -- it was a little 15@@ -@@ story kore@@ an hotel .
what if they &apos;re doing important work ?
we &apos;re really excited about the possibility of an inter@@ species internet , and k@@ .@@ j@@ . has been enjo@@ ying the conference very much .
this particular one came in out of the forest to li@@ ck this boy and cur@@ led up around the fi@@ replace to go to sleep . a wild animal .
and what i understand from my brazi@@ lian friends is that this guy is just a c@@ liche machine .
the sen@@ s@@ or is just a little stri@@ p of metal in that head@@ band there .
my name is ur@@ sus we@@ hr@@ l@@ i , and i would like to talk to you this morning about my project , ti@@ dying up art .
would you spend your rema@@ ining money on re@@ plac@@ ing it ?
and the final one is that most anti-@@ economic of activities , but give .
we &apos;re working with kei@@ th son@@ ni@@ er in new york , and we &apos;re making this large outside room , which is possible in los angel@@ es , and which is very much refle@@ ctive of the urban , the con@@ temporary urban environments that you would find in shi@@ bu@@ ya or you &apos;d find in mexico city or sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , etc . , that have to do with activ@@ ating the city over a longer sp@@ an of time .
and if we can find that , then we &apos;ll be able to find , within each one of us , what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : how do we change ?
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
so let me show you , this is our estim@@ ates of how fast we could translate wikipedia from english into span@@ ish .
of course , the best vacc@@ ine imag@@ in@@ able is only valu@@ able to the ex@@ tent we get it to everyone who needs it .
a galaxy . hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?
what does that do to the pay@@ ments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
she said , &quot; but it &apos;s too high . &quot;
now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver .
do you remember the hand@@ over of hong kong by bri@@ tain to china in 1997 ?
heart rates are slo@@ wer ; you live longer ; diff@@ usion of oxygen and resources across mem@@ bran@@ es is slo@@ wer , etc .
but in the end , it was na@@ than@@ iel who showed me that if i was truly passionate about change , if i wanted to make a difference , i already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
so i &apos;m re@@ aching over . she &apos;s got the scar@@ f on her right side .
i love public art .
would you tie those two str@@ ings together ? &quot;
gene is looking a little older .
so the van@@ tage point you take deter@@ min@@ es virtu@@ ally everything that you will see .
n as you know , the image of a lot of ye@@ men@@ i women is a lot of black and covered , vei@@ led women .
i worked up a port@@ fo@@ li@@ o , and i was headed to new york .
and that grew to 16@@ 0,000 students from 20@@ 9 countries .
i mean , come on , i &apos;m not going to turn down my thermo@@ st@@ at .
and oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on@@ ally they suff@@ er inten@@ se g@@ rie@@ f reac@@ tions because the child they &apos;ve gro@@ wn to love has changed so drama@@ tically and they don &apos;t recognize them .
in a hear@@ t-@@ mel@@ ting moment , education h@@ ost john le@@ gend si@@ ts at the piano to sing &quot; true colors , &quot; giving the ly@@ ri@@ cs a special meaning for kids and teachers . &quot; so don &apos;t be afraid / to let them show / your true colors / are beautiful , like a rain@@ bow . &quot;
well , i think what is far worse is man &apos;s de@@ struc@@ tive power over man .
what are you foc@@ using on ?
i lived in new york city .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken a group of teenagers in , and this has worked the best .
and as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in super@@ markets , and even in fa@@ st-@@ food out@@ lets .
that physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless em@@ body the same mathematical and cau@@ sal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
just as fish swim and birds fly , people form tri@@ bes . it &apos;s just what we do .
cro@@ ws , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it &apos;s not is@@ ol@@ ated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
everybody talks about carbon tax@@ es -- it won &apos;t work -- emis@@ sion sch@@ em@@ es , but for example , one policy measure , fee@@ d-@@ in t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s on the energy system , which is already applied , from china doing it on off@@ sh@@ ore wind systems , all the way to the u.s .
and i always wanted to go back into these mountains , to see if this could possibly be true , as indeed had been repor@@ ted by the great anthrop@@ ologist , reich@@ el@@ -@@ dol@@ mat@@ off .
we think that this these &quot; why &quot; questions can give us clu@@ es about the fundamental principles of nature .
here are the implan@@ tation sites .
so for example using your thum@@ b under with c major .
but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up ted , sm@@ all-@@ scale architecture -- at the present time can &apos;t really happen without a conversation about this , the world trade center , and what &apos;s been going on there , what it means to us .
i think that &apos;s a wor@@ thy research project myself .
we &apos;ve been told for 40 years already that they &apos;re coming soon .
and if you just listen to the guys who are hy@@ ping those issues , and making a lot of money out of it , you &apos;ll be mis@@ in@@ formed , and you &apos;ll be worrying about the wrong things .
so to our blue@@ print , we spli@@ t some ha@@ irs .
when i first read that , i thought , &quot; that sent@@ ence is in@@ an@@ e .
and this can create great natural shel@@ ters for animals , but they &apos;ve also been appro@@ pri@@ ated for some rather du@@ bi@@ ous human uses , including a bar , a prison and even a to@@ i@@ let inside of a tree .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
there was an interest in what was going on .
so these three p@@ ill@@ ars of personal health , care anywhere , care net@@ working , care cu@@ stom@@ i@@ zation , are happening in pieces now , but this vision will completely fail if we don &apos;t step up as care@@ gi@@ vers and as patients to take on new ro@@ les .
but when we began to bring more money , when we began to invest more resources , things got worse , not better . how ?
the problem with this pro@@ position is that the chinese state enjo@@ ys more le@@ giti@@ ma@@ cy and more auth@@ ority am@@ ong@@ st the chinese than is true with any western state .
do we live in a bor@@ der@@ less world ?
often we run into ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les . this is us coming back from one of these very r@@ ural sites , with spec@@ im@@ ens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours .
and i believe that what will be built at ground zero will be meaningful , will be in@@ spir@@ ing , will tell other generations of the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces , of the meaning of this event .
and i &apos;m not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem , because i don &apos;t care .
by the time i step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely , completely pre@@ vent@@ able problem .
time perspective is the study of how individuals , all of us , divide the flow of your human experience into time z@@ ones or time categories .
we don &apos;t know anything that e@@ ats it , we &apos;re trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stands , it &apos;s the mon@@ ster from hell , about which nobody knows what to do .
has anyone of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
is it simply the by@@ product of a cru@@ de mechan@@ ical action ?
they can use both my hands ; i can use ch@@ or@@ ding actions ; i can just go right up and use all 10 fing@@ ers if i wanted to .
e : hey , baby .
that seemed really like a crisis to me , that they had never been able to develop a vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary about escape , and about travel , and moder@@ nity in this tra@@ il@@ er that was consi@@ stent with the sh@@ ell .
in our media environment , it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t even exist .
you think black enter@@ tain@@ ers have it hard finding work in this business ? i &apos;m a sus@@ pi@@ cious mul@@ at@@ to , which means i &apos;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right .
i mean basically they &apos;ve we@@ an@@ ed us on to these hits of su@@ gar , salt and fat , and x , y , and z , and everyone lo@@ ves them . right ?
in a very , very ear@@ l@@ y-@@ morning set , they might be gi@@ ants rock the final day of ted@@ 2007 .
there &apos;s a recei@@ ver .
look around you -- here will do , in this room .
so we asked if humans and be@@ es might solve complex problems in the same way .
when we do this process , we make two types of err@@ ors .
of course not . you know , and someone who said , well , it was spinn@@ ing around in space and it &apos;s so huge , they would lock you up , and that &apos;s what they did back then .
men , women , young people , old people -- more women than men , actually , interestingly .
wor@@ k-@@ life balance , says ni@@ gel mar@@ sh , is too important to be left in the hands of your emplo@@ yer . mar@@ sh la@@ ys out an ide@@ al day balan@@ ced between family time , personal time and productivity -- and offers some stir@@ ring encoura@@ gement to make it happen . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to re@@ cover the memor@@ ies of these fro@@ zen brains .
we ad@@ ore babies because they &apos;re so c@@ ute .
i saw this diag@@ ram dra@@ wn by a french architect , and i thought , &quot; wow ! what a beautiful fra@@ c@@ tal ! &quot;
the theme next year is re-@@ birth .
and if we continue down this path , if we continue to feed kids bad food , if we continue not to teach them what good food is , what &apos;s going to happen ? you know , what is going to happen ?
we took standard statisti@@ cal techniques , so i &apos;m going to not talk about that .
their children are more self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent , more independent , and more so@@ cially sk@@ ill@@ ed than are our children .
so that &apos;s true love , right there .
no figh@@ ting , ladies .
i did this building in japan .
they &apos;re very little understood .
but this min@@ d@@ set has continued to be fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful to the soil and to the land that it emer@@ ged from .
that means , we can imagine -- i don &apos;t say it was fantastic , but in the &apos; 80s , there was not too much war , like that , it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civili@@ zed .
the room went ber@@ ser@@ k -- -- as frank nel@@ son cole sat down , having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words .
but , you know , would you have thought back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial cap@@ itali@@ st-@@ like thing to do to buy a ti@@ cket to go to the moon would be in russi@@ an hardware ?
and brian allen was able , in a mira@@ cul@@ ous flight , to get the g@@ os@@ samer al@@ bat@@ ross across the english chan@@ ne@@ l , and we won the 100@@ ,@@ 000-@@ po@@ und , 200@@ ,@@ 000-@@ dollar prize for that .
so i don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
for christ@@ mas i got a magic box and a very old book on card manipu@@ lation .
thank you very much .
now , in the process of doing this over here , how do you remember the sequences and do@@ ers ?
and then he sat down .
&quot; what ? &quot; i said , &quot; stop . &quot;
and in fact , it &apos;s gro@@ wn all over the world -- yu@@ c@@ ca , tap@@ i@@ o@@ ca , mani@@ o@@ c , cas@@ sa@@ va , it &apos;s all the same thing -- a very star@@ ch@@ y root vege@@ table .
so we can make a model of your heart , your brain on a chip .
no one is exactly shocked .
the site ch@@ osen is across from the lin@@ col@@ n memor@@ ial ; you see it there directly on the mall . it &apos;s the last building on the mall , on access of the ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt bridge that comes in from virginia .
five fac@@ tor@@ ial is 120 .
back to some of the more m@@ un@@ dan@@ e issues of thinking about un@@ certain@@ ty .
let me go right into the sli@@ des .
you can create forms , and once you &apos;ve created the forms , you push them to a variety of common mobile phones .
this fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
i had 13 students when i first walked into the class .
now what are the imp@@ li@@ cations of that ?
it &apos;s a huge problem .
oh sorry , i dropped one .
human rights is also important , but it just gets one cross .
the wisdom lives inside of them .
what matters here isn &apos;t technical capital , it &apos;s social capital .
every school succe@@ e@@ ds .
i think there are acci@@ dent@@ al parents ; there &apos;s no doubt about that .
obviously , that &apos;s heavy for am@@ anda .
si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half thousand people dying a day in africa may be africa &apos;s crisis , but the fact that it &apos;s not on the ni@@ ghtly news , that we in europe , or you in america , are not treating it like an emergen@@ cy -- i want to argu@@ e with you tonight that that &apos;s our crisis .
now here at ted , over the last couple of days , i &apos;ve seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible .
it &apos;s not an idea . it &apos;s not equivalent to anything else , really .
and we du@@ g up giant tor@@ to@@ ises , and eleph@@ ants and things like that .
that gives us , it turns out , quite a good cl@@ ue , except you have to go back quite a long time .
and artists who were for@@ mer@@ ly constra@@ ined can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
and you may wonder why .
a wise person knows when to b@@ end the rules .
so then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to ha@@ unt you .
puts it in re@@ verse . fif@@ ty-@@ five out of the dri@@ ve@@ way , in re@@ verse .
here is a clos@@ e-@@ up of the fossi@@ l , after five years of clean@@ ing , prepar@@ ation and descri@@ ption , which was very long , and i had to exp@@ ose the bones from the sand@@ stone block i just showed you in the previous slide .
the first story is i didn &apos;t have any money -- that &apos;s a sign i used a lot .
you would literally hear the sound .
and it fun@@ ds a lot of my research .
the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe .
but you go and look to the center of the galaxy , it &apos;s thousands of years ago .
you can touch it .
that &apos;s something i think is very , very important .
what glamour is all about -- i took this from a bl@@ ur@@ b in the table of cont@@ ents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about trans@@ cen@@ ding the everyday .
it &apos;s not about foun@@ da@@ tions necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
and he had nine days to make it .
it &apos;s just d@@ ough that is we@@ t .
lu@@ cy m@@ cra@@ e : how can technology trans@@ form the human body ?
and i thought it might serve as a kind of perman@@ ent m@@ ne@@ mon@@ ic device .
and at that time , it became set in stone : the aqu@@ a@@ tic theory should be du@@ mp@@ ed with the u@@ fo@@ s and the ye@@ tis , as part of the lun@@ a@@ tic fr@@ in@@ ge of science .
thank you .
david is fe@@ ar@@ less of technology , and he is absolutely ten@@ ac@@ i@@ ous .
by the middle of fe@@ bru@@ ary , i found myself in tur@@ in , where enthusi@@ astic crow@@ ds che@@ ered when any of the 80 olymp@@ ic teams was in the street .
now that we &apos;ve had all that happen , and we have all this data out there telling us that it &apos;s much better to have diversity around the decisi@@ on-@@ making tables , will we see business and fin@@ ance change ?
okay , they think money is slightly important .
it &apos;s an american , american soldiers , american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east -- in iraq or afghanistan .
now that would give you an un@@ fair advantage . &quot;
we need to breathe . the only fac@@ tory capable to trans@@ form co2 into oxygen , are the forests .
well it &apos;s hard to say .
we &apos;re going to do some open-@@ heart surgery . i was the only br@@ it , on a team of about nine american car@@ dia@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons , car@@ dia@@ c nurse , inten@@ sive care nurse .
i think we should be as@@ suming computers for doing the calcul@@ ating and only doing hand calcu@@ lations where it really makes sense to teach people that .
but i realized that there was this one h@@ ill on our golf course , the 1@@ 3@@ th hole that had this huge h@@ ill .
wher@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ars are white .
we use this word &quot; happy , &quot; and it &apos;s this very large um@@ br@@ ell@@ a of a term .
so we have this huge challenge , this huge gap .
people say , oh , do that . an astro@@ lo@@ ger tells me to do something .
if you have 500 grams , 1000 , one kilo@@ gram , he will gr@@ ind it for it for you ; the fl@@ our@@ mil@@ l will not gr@@ ind such a small quanti@@ ty .
and i think if we can just admit that we &apos;re all trying to appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te the truth of our own communities , it will make for a much more nu@@ an@@ ced and a much more interesting conversation .
i thought , this is somebody i &apos;ve got to get in this series .
n@@ w : so this is from this animal right here , greater sp@@ ot@@ -@@ n@@ osed gu@@ en@@ on .
it &apos;s one of the challenges in our prof@@ ession to try and explain what we do .
i had to eat right , exer@@ cise , medi@@ tate , pe@@ t dogs , because that lo@@ wers the blood pressure .
and thir@@ dly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a c@@ liche . and i &apos;m happy to say , i was par@@ tly responsible for that c@@ liche that machines are becoming biological , but that &apos;s pretty evi@@ dent .
what i have in mind is : terror@@ ism happens here ; we over@@ re@@ act to it .
because i want to simp@@ li@@ fy them for you .
and bee@@ f production uses 100 times the water that most vege@@ tables do .
our answer , of course , was yes .
and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected . and in that way , you can connect with the auth@@ ors of these stat@@ ements if you feel some degree of em@@ pathy .
the who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
but we have something .
and so i fell in love with this , and said look , we have all this knowledge about brains . how hard can it be ?
thank you .
he was saying this in a less eff@@ em@@ in@@ ate way .
and when he came out of the san@@ it@@ ari@@ um , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found trans@@ fin@@ ite set theory because the largest set of infin@@ ity would be god himself .
so instead , we decided to take the col@@ um@@ n , and we decided to build it as a la@@ y@@ ered model , made out of very many sli@@ ces , thin@@ ly st@@ ac@@ ked over each other .
mal@@ col@@ m mclean was moving from one country to another and was wonder@@ ing why it took these guys so long to get the box@@ es onto the ship .
all right . so we &apos;re going to immer@@ se ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because , you know , it &apos;s really nai@@ ve to think that the e@@ aster bun@@ ny put all the resources on the contin@@ ents .
and they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
they repor@@ ted this to who . who took a little while taking action because who will only recei@@ ve a report from a government , because it &apos;s the united nations .
this is how we go into a relationship , and it &apos;s hun@@ k@@ y-@@ d@@ ory for a year .
that also doesn &apos;t even get into the whole prot@@ ein extra@@ ction that we do from the ocean .
so i tor@@ e my kne@@ e jo@@ int men@@ is@@ c@@ us car@@ ti@@ lage playing soc@@ cer in college .
how can we create inter@@ faces , new windows into the minds of animals , with the technologies that exist today ?
who -- put up your hands -- who says two years ?
this is from a work@@ ben@@ ch in j@@ il@@ in city , in china , and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together .
second it &apos;s driving itself .
&quot; okay , hon@@ ey . a thousand@@ th of an inch to the left .
it &apos;s a se@@ du@@ ctor , but i just feel in my bones that that &apos;s possible .
so let &apos;s move to chap@@ ter two : the oil era .
okay , next , clu@@ b@@ bing .
we have less than we had before , and most of them are in fairly ste@@ ep decl@@ ine .
our friends , our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things .
ko@@ ko once bl@@ am@@ ed her pe@@ t kit@@ ten for ri@@ pping a sin@@ k out of the wall .
and we didn &apos;t have the evidence for that .
and they fly into the er@@ up@@ ting vol@@ can@@ o .
be@@ ver@@ ly + der@@ eck j@@ ou@@ bert : life lessons from big cats
we finished ps 2@@ 34 , and had dinner with a small group .
the man , his name was ma@@ hm@@ ou@@ d , and the child , whose name was ra@@ fi , left .
thank you so much for sharing this idea at ted .
in the teacher &apos;s contra@@ ct , it will li@@ mit the number of times the princi@@ pal can come into the class@@ room -- sometimes to once per year .
but i tell you what happened to me .
you know , it &apos;s interesting .
and not only that , they make the analo@@ gy to rela@@ tivity theory and cos@@ m@@ ology often .
fortun@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
so this is an example from the ya@@ ho@@ o regi@@ stra@@ tion page .
okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
so i could do a lot of projects , and here i am going to share with you only three of them .
and it &apos;s sho@@ ck@@ ingly not a new idea .
re@@ my@@ a j@@ ose has developed ...
never mind that it doesn &apos;t affect our lives at all .
a song must be heard in sequence over time , and you must play it back in sequence over time .
and they &apos;re an enorm@@ ously useful tool in modern molecu@@ lar biology .
earlier this year , in mar@@ ch , clay took his own life .
it co@@ sts 50 bu@@ cks just to inst@@ all it on your computer , making the publi@@ sh@@ er about another 2@@ 75 million .
take any cognitive dom@@ ain you want , memory , motor planning , thinking about your mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , getting angry at people , emotional response , it goes on and on , put people into func@@ tional mri devices , and image how these kinds of vari@@ ab@@ les map onto brain activity .
and let &apos;s rec@@ ru@@ it students from the whole of africa , bring them together with lec@@ tur@@ ers from all over the world , and we &apos;ll try to give them a fantastic education .
now , back to the un@@ fol@@ ding ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ se .
he says , &quot; i can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
fri@@ day street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a fri@@ day .
this is a political education , to be sure .
my mom grab@@ bed us by the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders . she mar@@ ched us out in the field .
you see , the ma@@ gi@@ cian doesn &apos;t really saw the la@@ dy in half . &quot;
now , there &apos;s one piece of good news i have that may save the world . okay .
i believe that these tools that worked in these 4@@ 2 pil@@ ot cases can be con@@ soli@@ dated in standard process@@ es in a b@@ p@@ o kind of environment , and made available on web , call@@ -@@ center and fran@@ ch@@ ise physical off@@ ices , for a fe@@ e , to serve anyone con@@ fron@@ ted with a dem@@ and for a bri@@ be .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
give it up for the fundamental partic@@ le that be@@ que@@ a@@ ths all other fundamental particles their mass .
the blue whale , it &apos;s a d@@ warf if compared with the real biggest cre@@ ature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequ@@ o@@ i@@ a@@ den@@ dron gi@@ gan@@ te@@ um .
i mean , it &apos;s &quot; the future we will create . &quot;
but when we went to speak with her , when we took this photograph , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders were still men@@ ac@@ ing us from the si@@ del@@ ines . they ha@@ dn &apos;t been really p@@ ush@@ ed back .
so i had to give up the approach of dra@@ wing the fantas@@ y shap@@ es and conver@@ t it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing , the shape of the f@@ us@@ el@@ age and so on -- and build an air@@ plane over these drawings that i knew follo@@ wed some of the principles of flying .
now , so , our autis@@ m study is just beginning . we got three million dollars .
what kinds of people would join a global community wel@@ coming people from every discipl@@ ine and culture , who se@@ ek a deeper understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
and this also actually happens with tun@@ a and sc@@ allo@@ ps .
and this pe@@ a@@ ks at super bowl sun@@ day when guys would rather be in a bar with str@@ an@@ gers , watching a totally over@@ dres@@ sed a@@ ar@@ on ro@@ d@@ gers of the green bay pack@@ ers , rather than jen@@ ni@@ fer lo@@ pe@@ z totally na@@ ked in the bedro@@ om .
so every time you buy tick@@ ets on tick@@ et@@ master , you help to digiti@@ ze a book .
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this do@@ c , and i get your ct s@@ can today and you &apos;ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your li@@ ver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
i know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that i &apos;m car@@ los sal@@ in@@ as de gor@@ tar@@ i &apos;s son from the fact that i &apos;m a citi@@ zen concerned about the country &apos;s current situation .
because half the world &apos;s population r@@ uns the risk of contra@@ cting a kil@@ ler disease like malaria through a simple mos@@ qui@@ to bi@@ te .
play a real quie@@ t gro@@ om@@ ing song .
there &apos;s not one that we know of . &quot;
car@@ l hon@@ or@@ é : in pra@@ ise of slow@@ ness
this is the fla@@ g of mon@@ ac@@ o . ladies and gent@@ lemen , the fla@@ g of indones@@ ia . please exam@@ ine .
in fact , in the united states , the teaching system has worked fairly well .
we know about this stuff .
we &apos;re seeing the emergen@@ ce of long-term and hig@@ hl@@ y-@@ fund@@ ed program@@ s which a@@ im at understanding our net@@ worked world from a complexity point of view .
it &apos;s called &quot; aria . &quot;
so the story of our team , a de@@ di@@ cated team , is fish and chi@@ ps .
and i don &apos;t just mean that always happens with the internet , i mean that always happens with media , full stop .
his wife was home in new ze@@ al@@ and , seven months pre@@ gn@@ ant with their first child , and rob asked to be pat@@ ched into her . that was done , and rob and his wife had their last conversation .
sh@@ an@@ k@@ ar ve@@ dan@@ ta@@ m is the author of &quot; the hidden brain : how our un@@ consci@@ ous minds ele@@ ct presi@@ dents , control markets , wage wars , and save our lives . &quot;
i remember what she looked like before she left .
difficult .
now , the animal mind , and also my mind , puts sensor@@ y-@@ based information into categories .
so as a ro@@ o@@ kie teacher , i created opportunity .
what could i do ?
i &apos;m going to ste@@ al a story from a friend of mine , a bos@@ ni@@ an friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illu@@ strate for you exactly what it feels like .
and i was just recently at the e@@ ve online fan fe@@ sti@@ val in re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ v@@ í@@ k that was quite amazing .
when i started in journal@@ ism -- financial times , 20 years ago -- it was very , very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper .
tumor treating fields were invented by dr. yor@@ am pal@@ ti , professor emer@@ it@@ us at the techni@@ on in israel .
&quot; not we , i@@ . &quot;
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term .
don &apos;t put it in the fo@@ yer .
and that moment of inspiration , that key invention moment , was when i was sitting in front of my design not@@ e@@ book and i started thinking about somebody grab@@ bing a le@@ ver , and if they gra@@ b near the end of the le@@ ver , they can get an effectively long le@@ ver and produce a lot of tor@@ que as they push back and forth , and effectively get a low ge@@ ar .
just try both of them .
but that &apos;s not happening here .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
and you can adap@@ t really precisely .
so being a gang leader in the inner city wasn &apos;t such a bad deal in the mi@@ d@@ - &apos; 80s .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
this is bigger than the state of ari@@ zon@@ a .
i call them the che@@ e@@ ta@@ h generation .
and , i noticed that most in@@ ven@@ tions fail , not because the r &amp; amp ; d department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually succe@@ ed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the ti@@ ming is wrong -- not all the enab@@ ling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection .
the mathematics of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics very accur@@ ately describes how our universe works .
this is how we &apos;ve been taught in school .
so the countries that had women repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives were can@@ ada , ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , phili@@ pp@@ ines , tr@@ ini@@ dad to@@ b@@ ago , ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a , lich@@ ten@@ stein and me .
the teachers said , &quot; is this deep learning ? &quot;
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be inter@@ rup@@ ted .
we were able to tell that she bel@@ on@@ ged to the human family tree because the legs , the foot , and some fe@@ atures clearly showed that she walked up@@ right , and up@@ right walking is a hall@@ mark in humanity .
what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
we have jam@@ i from hung@@ ary , who first starts making weap@@ ons : he &apos;s the technology wi@@ z .
you have one te@@ tra@@ he@@ dron which is the gate that &apos;s going to do your computing , and you have two input te@@ tra@@ he@@ dr@@ ons .
i know you think of yourself as human beings , but i think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacter@@ ial .
and so it &apos;s not an accident that a great flo@@ wer@@ ing of innovation happened as england swit@@ ched to te@@ a and coffee .
in his 20@@ s , he was a hot@@ shot ad ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive , and as mad men has told us , a ra@@ ging alco@@ holi@@ c .
this is a typical african hospital . we can &apos;t dep@@ end on the el@@ ites -- they go to usa , ger@@ many , u.k. for treatment . unbelie@@ vable .
i &apos;ve called this vehicle , gener@@ ically , a vol@@ ant@@ or , after the latin word &quot; vol@@ ant , &quot; meaning , to fly in a light , nim@@ ble man@@ ner .
and then what i can do is manipu@@ late them with both of my fing@@ ers at the same time .
so they came to me -- c@@ n@@ n -- and they said , &quot; professor sel@@ ig@@ man , would you tell us about the state of psych@@ ology today ?
we showed them the whole cut , and they were all completely , what is this ?
are you blin@@ ding pass@@ ers by and mot@@ ori@@ sts on the free@@ ways ?
this time , i &apos;m going to talk about mental illness .
so here are the new rules of swimming , if any of you are afraid of swimming , or not good at it .
so , here is the imp@@ li@@ cation of the relationship between the worlds of cri@@ me , terror , and illegal economy , and our economy .
the queen just la@@ ys the eg@@ gs . there &apos;s no management .
so traditional reac@@ tors like a pres@@ su@@ ri@@ zed water reactor or bo@@ iling water reactor , they &apos;re very , very hot water at very high pres@@ sur@@ es , and this means , essentially , in the event of an accident , if you had any kind of bre@@ ach of this sta@@ in@@ less steel pressure ves@@ sel , the cool@@ ant would leave the core .
because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing and world-@@ alter@@ ing -- ted 199@@ 8 -- e@@ h .
and i in@@ tend to focus on most of the world &apos;s land that is turning to des@@ ert .
and all this time , i never saw a single rat in any of these places , until recently , when i was in the london se@@ wers .
death : death can cat@@ ch you anywhere , any@@ time , even at the organic .
but is it happening anywhere ?
it was a such a vis@@ cer@@ al , emo@@ tive experience . &quot;
em : that &apos;s right . so it &apos;s important that the ro@@ cket st@@ ages be able to come back , to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours .
so , i would say that what seems sometimes to be altru@@ ism , in relation to africa , or in relation to developing countries , is more than that . it is en@@ ligh@@ tened self-@@ interest for us to work with other countries .
this fish is called the sh@@ ining tu@@ bes@@ hou@@ l@@ der because it actually has a tube on its sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der that can squ@@ ir@@ t out light .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire &apos;s just a foundation .
but then i read on and i read this : &quot; first , no@@ ah had never seen rain , because pri@@ or to the flo@@ od god irri@@ g@@ ated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
when you know where things are , it becomes easier to share them .
it has to totally sur@@ ren@@ der , as one sur@@ ren@@ ders to an anes@@ thesi@@ ologist .
there &apos;s always confli@@ cting evidence .
my heart was three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half si@@ zes too big .

i worked on conc@@ ep@@ ts like an electron@@ ic tat@@ too , which is aug@@ ment@@ ed by touch , or dres@@ ses that bl@@ ush@@ ed and shi@@ vered with light .
i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulner@@ ability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible .
so what seems like a very cl@@ un@@ k@@ y product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
don &apos;t forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget .
do you get nervous , as@@ hl@@ ei@@ gh ?
we &apos;ve become addi@@ cted to their certain@@ ty , their as@@ su@@ re@@ dness , their defini@@ ti@@ veness , and in the process , we have ce@@ ded our responsibility , sub@@ stit@@ u@@ ting our intelle@@ ct and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
he gave lec@@ tures to cal@@ tech under@@ gra@@ ds that became &quot; the fe@@ y@@ n@@ man lec@@ tures on physics . &quot;
any of those can be open@@ ed up .
but cap@@ ital@@ ism , as we know it , is only a few hundred years old , enab@@ led by cooperative ar@@ ran@@ gem@@ ents and technologies , such as the jo@@ in@@ t-@@ stock ow@@ ner@@ ship company , shared li@@ ability in@@ sur@@ ance , dou@@ b@@ le-@@ ent@@ ry book@@ keeping .
how do we feed the world without destro@@ ying it ?
when my partner , steve , and i first started dat@@ ing , he told me this story about pengu@@ ins .
in a re@@ cent email to me , she expla@@ ined , &quot; a person should have some ambi@@ tion while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose . &quot;
i was working , i was going everyday to work for the hom@@ eless .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of micro@@ bial diversity , or variety of micro@@ bial types .
i &apos;d like to de@@ dic@@ ate this next song to car@@ mel@@ o , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so you may be asking , well why is it important that i know what enter@@ tains people ?
it &apos;s a true feeling .
some of you may recognize this image .
thank you .
du@@ ct t@@ ape .
why are you still thinking that the lessons of kat@@ r@@ ina do not apply to flu ? &quot;
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and bus@@ y doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
real quickly -- mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o once said he &apos;s there to &quot; discover the figure within , &quot; ok ?
we just did a project and then left so the media wouldn &apos;t know .
let us just take an example .
it looks like the fe@@ mal@@ es were cooperative h@@ unter@@ s with the men .
what drives the dis@@ ability for these dis@@ orders like schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ pol@@ ar and depression ?
but basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
then we set out to create an open source , di@@ y , do it yourself version that anyone can build and main@@ tain at a fra@@ ction of the cost .
the blood v@@ eins in our hands e@@ cho@@ ed a course of water tra@@ ces on the earth .
within a period of 60 days , his vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary went from two to three words to 300 words .
that &apos;s simple , the go@@ dd@@ ess of go@@ ats , very simple .
so , what &apos;s the point ? what should you do ?
diabetes i &apos;ve just mentioned . heart failure we already talked about . hyper@@ ten@@ sion : 7@@ 4 million people could have continu@@ ous bloo@@ d-@@ pressure monit@@ oring to come up with much better management and pre@@ vention .
you see a fil@@ am@@ ent , you see the light is the invisible matter , and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up .
it &apos;s a positive , virtu@@ ous circle .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
everything was done by the people to the people , and that &apos;s the power of the internet .
and there &apos;s some things you just don &apos;t need to have in songs .
it &apos;s very slow .
imagine you can do that .
it takes advantage of the others .
li@@ ke@@ wise , we can create our own whist@@ les , our own whist@@ le names , and let the dolphins request specific di@@ vers to interact with .
when life brought about a series of death and ne@@ ar-@@ death experiences within my close circle , which high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for an emergen@@ cy medical response service in india , similar to 9@@ 11 in usa .
this is similar to having the sun sh@@ ining on the earth , driving phot@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis , driving the ecosystem .
talking at the us state department this summer , hans rosling uses his fascinating dat@@ a-@@ bub@@ ble software to bur@@ st my@@ ths about the developing world . look for new analysis on china and the post-@@ ba@@ il@@ out world , mix@@ ed with classi@@ c data shows .
it can only be understood in the context of story , and everything , all of this is story .
thanks , chris .
and the 30 project is really focused on these long-term ideas for food system change .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
and certainly , when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we &apos;ve created fear and dan@@ ger , often from l@@ ack of knowledge , l@@ ack of real understanding , how do you see the way that the western press in particular is cover@@ ing this and all other stories out of the region , but in particular , in your country ?
this shows that the effect of the sun &apos;s variations on climate is over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by the increasing greenhouse g@@ asses , main@@ ly from bur@@ ning fossi@@ l fu@@ els .
and they are not mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous in vic@@ tory .
and ultimately -- and here &apos;s a picture of our bone mar@@ row transp@@ l@@ ant survi@@ vor@@ s , who come together for a re@@ union each year at stanford .
so i got inspired by that .
this has really invi@@ gor@@ ated me da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day .
some 1,@@ 500 miles south of the tro@@ pic@@ s , between chi@@ le and bo@@ li@@ via , the and@@ es completely change .
so the king of england , al@@ fre@@ d the great , will use a vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary and gram@@ mar that is quite different from the king of hi@@ p ho@@ p , ja@@ y-@@ z .
some of these are s@@ wollen ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ des that look a little larger than others .
well , then let &apos;s build something that we can both benefit from , and find some way to make a new relationship with these species .
it is transpar@@ ent , made just for you .
but that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
but then , i want to know how you &apos;re special .
this was the big bang , the beginning of the universe .
so for any of us in this room today , let &apos;s start out by ad@@ mit@@ ting we &apos;re lucky .
she &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
there are some di@@ le@@ mm@@ as you see .
these are leaders who , in ad@@ dition to being highly capable , pos@@ s@@ ess two important qualities , and they are hu@@ mili@@ ty and ambi@@ tion .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful .
that &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an apple up@@ ward and it goes up faster and faster .
man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der .
thank you .
and i thought back to that wonderful p@@ hr@@ ase i had learned as a boy from sen@@ ec@@ a , in which he says , &quot; that man is poor not who has little but who han@@ kers after more . &quot;
so this is slo@@ wed down .
and if i go back in time , i &apos;ve added some histor@@ ical statistics -- here we go , here we go , here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago .
well , that &apos;s what ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is about , right ?
and it really seems peri@@ pher@@ al , we never think about it , until we don &apos;t have access to it , and then it becomes a gat@@ e@@ keep@@ er .
and if you don &apos;t know how , please find me -- i will help you .
because i was interested in inte@@ gr@@ ating these two worlds , i thought of sti@@ cky not@@ es .
what happens if we were to take the president &apos;s dna , or a king or queen &apos;s , and put it out to a group of a few hundred tru@@ sted resear@@ ch@@ ers so they could study that dna and do pen@@ et@@ ration te@@ sting against it as a means of helping our leaders ?
is it just literally for control , for hand-@@ stick control ? why am i doing that ?
i want to basically have the entire zoo of hu@@ b@@ ble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with , again , as toys .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a ra@@ il@@ way em@@ ban@@ k@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
if you are willing to do this , you can take a couple of drop@@ s of a bit@@ ter substance or a s@@ our substance , and you &apos;ll see that face , the ton@@ gue stick out , the wr@@ in@@ kl@@ ed nose , as if they &apos;re trying to get rid of what &apos;s in their mouth .
so i write po@@ em@@ s to figure things out .
we had m@@ o bro@@ s from can@@ ada , from the u.s. , and from the u.k. ema@@ iling us and call@@ ing us and saying , hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
for a start , you won &apos;t have to listen to an in@@ suff@@ er@@ able little jum@@ pe@@ d-@@ up jesus like myself .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the most pro@@ gressi@@ ve or 21@@ st-@@ century of job tit@@ les , but i &apos;ve spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the ar@@ ctic circle , so i get out of the house a fair bit .
there &apos;s also something a little far@@ ther out , called the o@@ ort clou@@ d .
and a more re@@ cent one : &quot; the possibility of susta@@ ining high culture in our time is becoming increasing proble@@ ma@@ tical .
and for me , i quickly land@@ ed on this one : the earth has a toler@@ ance of about .@@ 17 percent from the re@@ ference sp@@ hero@@ id , which is less than the .@@ 22 percent allowed in billi@@ ard b@@ alls .
the pho@@ en@@ ix islands and all the equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al parts of our planet are very important for tun@@ a fis@@ her@@ ies , especially this yel@@ low@@ f@@ in tun@@ a that you see here .
and ri@@ l@@ ke , &quot; if your daily life seems poor , do not bl@@ ame it ; bl@@ ame yourself .
we want to talk about stor@@ ing energy , and unfortunately the best thing we &apos;ve got going is something that was developed in france a hundred and fif@@ ty years ago , the lead ac@@ id battery .
maybe a so@@ ber@@ ing thought and something you all know about .
let me give you a quick re@@ min@@ der of something that you &apos;ve long for@@ gotten .
one place we &apos;re all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . right ?
you know , the interesting thing here , though , is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .
and then he went on , and then he turned to me and said , &quot; you &apos;re an american .
you &apos;ll see what happens when there is a mista@@ ke .
it was very pri@@ mal and more remote than anything i &apos;d ever experi@@ enced before .
now , you &apos;ve all seen &quot; in@@ convenient truth . &quot; this is a little more in@@ convenient .
he even once tra@@ ded a work of art for a block of government che@@ ese because the person wanted it so b@@ adly .
sometimes they don &apos;t even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line .
if it happens , how bad do you think it will be ?
let &apos;s take a look at some numbers .
vic@@ tor@@ ia ? yes , cor@@ re@@ ct .
how many have spent it in the red places ?
let me show you some examples .
m@@ in &apos;s sister said to her parents , &quot; in america , this ba@@ g s@@ ells for 3@@ 20 dollars . &quot;
i was the first one to be pi@@ cked up , so they put me in a cell , which was just like a room with a door with bars on it .
we moved from that to becoming farmers and cul@@ tiv@@ ators of information .
we expect to start hau@@ ling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna .
and this example is the lat@@ ter .
5@@ 29 .
things have changed now . we have cars that we take across country .
but in this case , it &apos;s not about the author , it &apos;s not about the book or the movie or the story , it &apos;s about the object in and of itself .
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
after one har@@ v@@ est , they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quar@@ ter@@ -@@ acre .
but nothing prepar@@ ed us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hun@@ ting .
they even put a recip@@ e up on the wall , until they were told this was illegal .
and i think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature , and hasn &apos;t made us any happ@@ ier at all .
you get more money because your terms of trade have impro@@ ved , but also that drives up out@@ put across the board .
at least he &apos;ll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation .
all the more reason to take the million dollars , wouldn &apos;t you think , sylvia ?
it &apos;s actually mini@@ -@@ ec@@ li@@ p@@ ses that occu@@ r when a planet pass@@ es in front of its star .
and here is mer@@ ce c@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ham , i was fortunate to dance with him when i was yo@@ unger , and here he is a dan@@ cer , and while he is dan@@ cing , he is both the dan@@ cer and the dance .
now , i want to leave you with a final no .
in architecture , it works just the same .
so , this would be the twi@@ tter search screen .
i wanted to show you the ways , inno@@ cu@@ ous as they seem , in which we &apos;re in@@ corpor@@ ating what we &apos;ve learned about girls -- their des@@ ires to experience greater emotional flexi@@ bility , and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .
and as a result -- once we got over a little hur@@ d@@ le , and having to audi@@ tion twice -- they accep@@ ted me . and not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom .
and so i think the answer to this puzzle is that there &apos;s a much better solution out there , that &apos;s gotten nobody excited because everyone is so del@@ igh@@ ted with the way car se@@ ats are pres@@ um@@ ably working .
in short , we ad@@ mi@@ re their will@@ ing@@ ness to play .
go to cli@@ mat@@ ec@@ ris@@ is@@ .@@ or@@ g or carb@@ on@@ calcul@@ at@@ or@@ .com and buy carbon cre@@ di@@ ts . you could join other leaders in mand@@ ating , lo@@ b@@ b@@ ying for mand@@ ated cap and trade in u.s. greenhouse gas redu@@ ctions .
for example , when i &apos;m psycho@@ tic i often have the del@@ usion that i &apos;ve killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts .
and suddenly all these tiny , little worlds , they come together in this complex web .
we &apos;ve seen under the sea , three miles down , or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future .
everybody was really excited about curiosity , and that had this big pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um battery on board that has pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um-@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-@@ en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um fuel of these mol@@ ten salt reac@@ tors , which means that the effects would be ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activ@@ ate this reactor .
thank you .
he would have the sound coming through the reson@@ ators .
she was a leader of the men@@ om@@ ine@@ e tri@@ be , a native american peop@@ les .
and so is it any wonder , given all of the co@@ sts and the side effects of the drugs that we &apos;re using to treat these pre@@ conditions , that every year we &apos;re spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet 100,000 people a year -- and that &apos;s a conser@@ va@@ tive estimate -- are dying not because of the conditions they have , but because of the treatments that we &apos;re giving them and the compli@@ cations of those treatments ?
so i went out and studied a bunch of things , and i found a survey that showed that 9@@ 4 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the in@@ tangi@@ bles are important in their business , things like intellectual property , their corporate culture , their brand lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , and yet , only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of meas@@ uring the in@@ tangi@@ bles in their business .
she then assig@@ ned these works ra@@ cial identi@@ ties , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the op@@ posi@@ te case : bo@@ b col@@ esc@@ ot@@ t , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american artist ; le@@ on gol@@ u@@ b , a white artist .
this is a little ban@@ gla@@ des@@ hi girl from the east end of london who &apos;s got a huge mal@@ ig@@ n@@ ant tumor on the right side of her face , which has already made her blind and which is rap@@ i@@ dly growing and is going to kill her shor@@ tly .
he just started to create that dance himself .
if you want to stay alive you &apos;ve got to have back@@ ups .
what else is in this picture ?
i liked being smart .
and they said , you know what happens is , miner@@ al -- just like at your house -- miner@@ al buil@@ ds up .
each element is completely iden@@ tical , and they &apos;re bi@@ as@@ ed .
but it is a cru@@ el , vi@@ cious , absolutely consci@@ en@@ c@@ eless -- i &apos;ll be all right , keep your se@@ ats -- game that these people play .
they make mista@@ kes every single day -- mista@@ kes born out of car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
we &apos;re now tex@@ ting out to about 200@@ ,000 kids a week about doing our campaig@@ ns to make their schools more green or to work on hom@@ eless issues and things like that .
he took 20@@ ,000 and then 6@@ 0,000 dis@@ aggre@@ g@@ ated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from r@@ ats -- put them on a chip .
this is my contribu@@ tion to the civil rights fight of my generation .
and with his only diplom@@ a , his primary education cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , he found himself working at a dy@@ er - dry clean@@ er .
al@@ as@@ da@@ ir ma@@ cin@@ ty@@ re , the famous philosop@@ her , said that , &quot; we have the conc@@ ep@@ ts of the an@@ cient mor@@ ality of virtu@@ e , honor , goo@@ dness , but we no longer have a system by which to connect them . &quot;
so the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
what we are looking at is the first three hours .
no , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? so we used to di@@ al ; now we speed di@@ al .
and i &apos;m here to tell you the em@@ per@@ or has no clothes .
if you look over the past couple decades at the re@@ turns to capital -- in other words , corporate prof@@ its -- we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-@@ time high .
so think about it .
i was fi@@ red up ; i was ready to make a difference .
the internet starts with mathematics , it starts with bin@@ ary .
and a cri@@ tically important step in understanding our own des@@ ires and ta@@ stes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want deep down .
so , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don &apos;t yet , but if we did -- we should be able to calcu@@ late the allowed not@@ es , the allowed vi@@ bra@@ tional patterns .
it &apos;s great to have companies in ital@@ y who support this way of dre@@ aming .
and the secret is she op@@ ens every single one .
and so when i think about the future , people will be thinking that sharing the ri@@ de with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day .
at the end of the day , as hyper@@ connec@@ tivity and transpar@@ ency exp@@ ose companies &apos; behavior in bro@@ ad day@@ light , staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value pro@@ position .
it &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a cal@@ en@@ dar .
and she decided , despite the ad@@ vice of her neighbor@@ s , that she would take the chance and cla@@ im to be viet@@ nam@@ ese so that we could have a chance to survive , because at this point they &apos;re for@@ cing everybody to work .
even in north korea , i was an f student .
you get bar@@ e@@ foot solar engineers car@@ rying solar panels into the remote mountains .
remember , i study dec@@ eption . i can tell if you don &apos;t raise your hand .
if you &apos;re already 100 , or even if you &apos;re 80 -- and an average 8@@ 0-@@ year-old , we probably can &apos;t do a lot for you with these therap@@ ies , because you &apos;re too close to death &apos;s door for the really initial , experim@@ ent@@ al therap@@ ies to be good enough for you .
now , there were two dis@@ sent@@ ers , one of wh@@ om was justice sc@@ alia .
so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
where are you feeling this ?
all these medi@@ cations , nothing seems to be working .
so to our blue@@ print , let &apos;s atta@@ ch cla@@ ws .
new word .
by 2008 , we &apos;re going to ki@@ ck the bu@@ tt of the music industry .
now a couple of companies -- like google -- they have innovation time off , 20 percent time , where , in a sense , those are hun@@ ch@@ -@@ cul@@ tiv@@ ating mechanisms in an organization .
another really surprising part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are affected by ine@@ quality .
&quot; oh , jesus . &quot;
he &apos;s called an is@@ thr@@ i wal@@ a . but he &apos;s car@@ rying a 21@@ st-@@ century instrument .
hig@@ gs particles , if you will .
so , for example , here is a real network of college students at an el@@ ite nor@@ the@@ astern university .
it &apos;s an amazing experience .
the process to get to make the sculp@@ ture was interesting , because i wrote to bal@@ sar@@ a , who produ@@ ces that air fres@@ hen@@ er called o@@ don@@ il , saying , &quot; de@@ ar sir , i am an artist . this is my cat@@ alo@@ gue .
but there &apos;s another rare syndro@@ me , so rare , in fact , that very few physi@@ cians have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logi@@ sts .
and it works like this .
the one with the yel@@ low-@@ green suit , he &apos;s flying head-@@ down .
and you can do it the same , over and over again . &quot;
and what we see in all pa@@ irs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent es@@ cal@@ ation in force on each go .
in fact , it goes against natural survival .
by doing that , you are now part of my piece .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
you see some sort of random distribution -- perhaps 6@@ 7 attac@@ ks , one person was killed , or 47 attac@@ ks where seven people were killed .
do you know of any painting that didn &apos;t have a pain@@ ter ? yes / no .
second is , frie@@ dr@@ ich nie@@ tz@@ sche along about 18@@ 85 wrote a book tit@@ led &quot; the birth of tragedy . &quot;
he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential , p@@ ure identi@@ ty : religious , ethnic , histor@@ ical , ide@@ ological .
i was like , &quot; no , no . i &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosi@@ ves .
they &apos;re not something that &apos;s been establi@@ shed .
whether it &apos;s nature or the exer@@ cise itself , it certainly works .
it goes as far back into the past as 18@@ 00 , &apos; cause you never know .
so here , i can make a be@@ t , and this is actually one of the points where i get my money .
and it &apos;s really , just sort of -- for me , it was just really about the l@@ us@@ ci@@ ousness of oil .
hil@@ le@@ l cooper@@ man : le@@ gos for grow@@ nu@@ ps
but what about designing something that isn &apos;t physical ?
so we had to come up with a different solution .
when people ask you , &quot; what is the evidence for evolution ? &quot;
and i began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplom@@ acy -- that diplom@@ acy , like business , is a business of solving problems , and yet the word innovation doesn &apos;t exist in diplom@@ acy ; it &apos;s all zero sum games and real@@ politik and an@@ cient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they &apos;ve always done things .
he was also the ultimate self-@@ lear@@ ner , and like everything else , he did it in grand style .
i went down . i go , &quot; where &apos;s my son ? &quot;
get your book@@ ings in time . thank you very much .
so we needed a social me@@ thod for fig@@ uring out the answer to this .
fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i ! of course .
after all , they decide , and they did .
how can me@@ tr@@ on@@ om@@ es communicate ?
this is why i &apos;m on this stage , but it &apos;s al@@ ar@@ ming .
this is the first voice they &apos;ve created for an individual .
with ende@@ aring hon@@ est@@ y and vulner@@ ability , ra@@ g@@ ha@@ va k@@ k tells the col@@ or@@ ful tale of how art has taken his life to new places , and how life experiences in turn have driven his multiple rein@@ car@@ nations as an artist -- from carto@@ on@@ ist to pain@@ ter , media dar@@ ling to social out@@ c@@ ast , and son to father .
in the mean@@ time , my very large jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children , and i felt like i was under tremendous pe@@ er pressure to get my life going already .
because they took me very g@@ ently from my boo@@ k-@@ lin@@ ed study and brought me into the 21@@ st century , enab@@ ling me to speak to a much , much wi@@ der audience than i could have ever conc@@ ei@@ ved .
in terms of the shi@@ pping noise , the international mari@@ time organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establi@@ sh gui@@ del@@ ines for quie@@ ting ships , to tell the industry how you could quie@@ t ships .
and we also have more than five billion of these devices here .
on the other hand , we know that these weap@@ ons give an advantage to attac@@ king .
and it turned out that -- i just went to see , you know , what they are doing in hong kong .
but when do you have pi@@ zz@@ a ?
and so i am going to leave you now with three call@@ s for action for those who share this vision .
the smo@@ ke al@@ arm has sa@@ ved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
here is david , in the right . and he is holding a camera .
now , you ask me , how far have we gotten down this path ?
so , it &apos;s kind of like when somebody says , who did that song ?
and let us give up our nar@@ row sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess in order to embra@@ ce change , and in order to cele@@ bra@@ te with the people of that region a great future and hope and toler@@ ance .
and then , of course , it dri@@ f@@ ts back into ordinary life and the memory fa@@ des .
since that time , he &apos;s continued to work with his people , and not only the as@@ han@@ in@@ ka nation , but all the peop@@ les of the ama@@ zon and beyond .
my life started as a -- i started life in 196@@ 6 , a few months before the bi@@ af@@ ran , which la@@ sted for three years and it was three years of war .
if i spli@@ t tanz@@ ania in its income , the richer 20 percent in tanz@@ ania has more hiv than the poor@@ est one .
we are the animals who eat coo@@ ked food .
so everybody must be able to say , &quot; this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i &apos;m able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it .
d@@ r : thank you .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
but what &apos;s interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechan@@ ical device suffering , at least indi@@ rec@@ tly , from a human disease .
he bur@@ ned all his po@@ e@@ try at the age of 24 and then did not write another po@@ em for at least seven years because he couldn &apos;t rec@@ ti@@ fy the life of a poet with the life of a pri@@ est .
it &apos;s like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own co@@ workers ?
she started cr@@ ying . she asked me to call her back .
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of l@@ one genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bi@@ kes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
and they did .
just to put everything in context , and to kind of give you a back@@ ground to where i &apos;m coming from , so that a lot of the things i &apos;m going to say , and the things i &apos;m going to do -- or things i &apos;m going to tell you i &apos;ve done -- you will understand exactly why and how i got motiv@@ ated to be where i am .
we lived in eth@@ iop@@ ia for a month , working at an or@@ phan@@ age .
why are they eng@@ aging with cyber@@ space ?
same thing here : you had an intui@@ tive response to this that was very quick .
and i did want to demon@@ strate the fact that the cha@@ ir can ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date people .
we have a function here -- i can tell the world , &quot; stay where you are . &quot;
the meaning of her name is pig .
ok . another person . oh , i for@@ got , i shouldn &apos;t shu@@ ff@@ le but i think -- -- actually , my techni@@ que is to pe@@ ek , all the time .
on the stage that day , i was so nervous .
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
now , we can measure that kind of skills in the lab .
may .
eating ethnic was un@@ heard of unless you were ethnic .
instead , what we see are social frame@@ works for all of the critical things that we use property and contra@@ ct in the market : information flo@@ ws to decide what are interesting problems ; who &apos;s available and good for something ; motivation structures -- remember , money isn &apos;t always the best motiv@@ ator .
however , if a video is there that everything was expla@@ ined to you , and you have it all in the video fi@@ le , it &apos;ll be much less likely that some hot@@ shot law@@ yer will take this case on contin@@ gen@@ cy , because it won &apos;t be nearly as good a case .
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
but one time it broke down .
that won &apos;t do much difference .
so school is a game , and there have been lots of experim@@ ent@@ ations on how we do this proper@@ ly .
we knew it had to be something which had no nee@@ d@@ les , no pri@@ cking , so it would have adop@@ tion , it would not have medical waste , all those problems .
thank you very much .
take an idea , draw a stick figure .
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
what they &apos;re pro@@ pos@@ ing is an almost four@@ -@@ times increase in production , and that would industri@@ alize an area the size of florida .
trouble in the valley , and trouble by the river too .
well , there &apos;s some great new technology that has just recently become available , and it &apos;s just a bo@@ on for getting insi@@ ght into open ocean animals .
so as a pat@@ ri@@ ot , i felt it was important to -- i wear all the ear@@ plu@@ gs and the ear@@ phones , and it &apos;s really impro@@ ved my life in a surprising and un@@ expected way .
so we have a suffering god -- a god who is in@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely connected with this world and with every living sou@@ l .
they believe they can win .
and so , i run on these , and have shocked half the world on these .
this is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k -- five and a quar@@ ter@@ -@@ inch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k infe@@ cted by brain@@ .@@ a .
they have professional vide@@ o@@ grap@@ her@@ s on staff .
so that big swe@@ ep@@ ing , white sphere in the corner is saturn , which is actually in the back@@ ground of the picture .
and she walked through the ri@@ ft valley , and she had vagina and vagina re@@ plac@@ ement parts where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like , and what a mu@@ til@@ ated vagina looks like . and in the course of her travel she walked literally for eight years through the ri@@ ft valley , through d@@ ust , through sle@@ ep@@ ing on the ground -- because the mas@@ a@@ is are nom@@ ads , and she would literally have to find them , and they would move , and she would find them again . she sa@@ ved 1,@@ 500 girls from being cut .
and the exciting thing is that we do have suffi@@ cient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope sp@@ ots , hot@@ sp@@ ots .
i che@@ cked the repor@@ ts on this one .
and that anti@@ cip@@ ation en@@ han@@ ces their well@@ being .
we think this can all be standar@@ di@@ zed , and then people can person@@ alize the stuff that goes into that wall , and like the car , we can inte@@ gra@@ te all kinds of sen@@ sing to be aware of human activity , so if there &apos;s a baby or a pupp@@ y in the way , you won &apos;t have a problem .
and experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it .
and as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically , the american man has become very rich .
please join us in this ep@@ ic ad@@ venture .
so all these factors , and many more besi@@ des , we don &apos;t even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to de@@ fe@@ at a mon@@ str@@ osity as big as bin la@@ den@@ ism , the global ji@@ had , you needed this group effort .
and we can bar@@ ely find the time to refle@@ ct deeply back in on our own selves .
so this is the in@@ famous cau@@ ler@@ pa ta@@ xi@@ fo@@ li@@ a , the so@@ -@@ called kil@@ ler al@@ ga@@ e .
open your heart to the incredible gif@@ ts that civilization gives to us .
we are poli@@ cing the world , and how are we doing that ?
so , everything is not going to be up for grab@@ s .
we just took a simple sa@@ iling bo@@ at and we tried to pull something long and heavy , but as we tac@@ ked back and forth , what we lost was two things : we were los@@ ing pul@@ ling power and direction .
p@@ r : we haven &apos;t prepar@@ ed anything .
they need to be stopped because this is a cru@@ el far@@ ce .
there &apos;s an a@@ version to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
there &apos;s the dod@@ d-@@ frank act , there &apos;s the new consumer financial protection agen@@ cy that is tempor@@ arily being headed through the back@@ door by el@@ iz@@ ab@@ eth war@@ ren .
and in between , there should be a public agen@@ cy , the independent service auth@@ ority , which chan@@ n@@ els public money , and especially don@@ or money , to the re@@ tail provi@@ ders .
one of the refer@@ e@@ es who refer@@ e@@ ed the paper said , &quot; it &apos;s too good to be true , &quot; which was not very nice .
in fact , i &apos;ve managed to stay clear of hos@@ pit@@ als for almost three decades , perhaps my pr@@ ou@@ dest ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment .
&quot; oh , well -- men are more adul@@ ter@@ ous ! &quot;
it was recently drag@@ ged for plan@@ k@@ ton by scientists , and they found six times as much plastic as plan@@ k@@ ton .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
it &apos;s better than a new monit@@ or . it &apos;s better than new software , or whatever people typ@@ ically use .
now , i was about hal@@ f@@ way through my pro career in , i would say , the mi@@ d@@ - &apos; 80s .
the cu@@ stom@@ er is happy , because the cu@@ stom@@ er is god .
now , i want you to just look really close up onto what &apos;s happened there .
and when you &apos;re hun@@ gry , food becomes more attra@@ ctive , and so forth .
it fol@@ ds in thirds . it &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that orig@@ ami .
this perhaps is why we find the god complex so temp@@ ting .
it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you ho@@ ok up with them .
and what if we could get ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te control over the essen@@ ce of energy , the electr@@ on ?
that &apos;s what wired magazine spent on this .
if you just run the simu@@ lation , it will just collap@@ se , like this .
is there an actual inspiration behind each one ?
it makes a difference whether you say , &quot; i &apos;m a part of this city .
you can put these things away , and then you can be inter@@ rup@@ ted on your own sch@@ edu@@ le , at your own time , when you &apos;re available , when you &apos;re ready to go again .
but if we look at the human scale , there &apos;s massive problems that aren &apos;t being add@@ res@@ sed by those nan@@ os@@ c@@ ale technologies .
so nobody knows how bad this bi@@ as with the official statistics actually is , so i thought i would ask the person who &apos;s spe@@ ar@@ head@@ ing the effort to generate data on this , pas@@ cal lam@@ y , the director of the world trade organization , what his best guess would be of expor@@ ts as a percent@@ age of g@@ dp , without the dou@@ ble@@ - and tri@@ ple@@ -@@ coun@@ ting , and it &apos;s actually probably a bit under 20 percent , rather than the 30 percent@@ -@@ plus numbers that we &apos;re talking about .
and it &apos;s something that we didn &apos;t think was possible .
girl : okay .
even in the rain , people stood between ma@@ dis@@ on and 5@@ th a@@ venue under their um@@ br@@ ell@@ as char@@ ging their cell phones from out@@ lets on the street .
jos@@ ette she@@ er@@ an , the head of the un &apos;s world food program , talks about why , in a world with enough food for everyone , people still go hun@@ gry , still die of starvation , still use food as a weap@@ on of war . her vision : &quot; food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person . we have to stand together . &quot;
i hope that in the last 16 minutes i &apos;ve told you something that you didn &apos;t know about aids , and i hope that i &apos;ve gotten you questi@@ on@@ ing a little bit some of the things that you did know .
with my dad , that turned out to be le@@ tting him fill out forms .
they might have been able to do it earlier .
and you can imagine the medical world went nu@@ ts over this as well .
the pun@@ ch@@ line to your journey ? look at the hori@@ zon .
and here you see a dead du@@ ck .
this probably is : the ar@@ al sea .
i did not have sexual rela@@ tions with that woman , miss le@@ win@@ sky .
when it comes time to she@@ et@@ rock , if you use ec@@ or@@ o@@ ck it &apos;s about a quar@@ ter of the em@@ bo@@ died energy of standard she@@ et@@ rock .
but , of course , i &apos;m working since 25 , doing more or less what you see here . this is ca@@ st@@ le@@ ton china .
and then i managed a restaurant , and then i sli@@ pped on things .
now these are multi@@ func@@ tional areas of the brain .
and i &apos;ve always had bu@@ o@@ yan@@ cy problems .
dry water body . children are standing on a very difficult device to explain .
there are many problems out there in the world .
what my language would have forced me to do , instead of just telling you , &quot; this is my un@@ cle , &quot; is to tell you a tremendous amount of addi@@ tional information .
how much land mass would ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les need to power a nation like the uk ? an entire country &apos;s worth . in this pra@@ g@@ ma@@ tic talk , david ma@@ ck@@ ay t@@ ours the basic mathematics that show worrying limit@@ ations on our sustainable energy options and explains why we should pur@@ su@@ e them anyway . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i remember looking at the guys thinking , &quot; what do i take from this journey ? &quot; you know ? seriously .
first of all , we have all these things in our hands .
i kept getting this call from this on@@ c@@ ologist named david a@@ gu@@ s .
and there &apos;s a pas@@ sage in it which i would love to share with you .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super@@ -@@ human str@@ ength and abilities .
one of them ended up with beat@@ rice &apos;s parents , and that go@@ at had tw@@ ins .
but he was right , it was a stupid idea .
in that moment and still today when i doubt , when i feel afraid , when i need to re@@ connect with that feeling , i remember his words , they were so powerful .
it &apos;s not fair for me ; it &apos;s not fair for my country .
i had no joke for that .
thank you .
but after one week of practic@@ ing , my thro@@ ws became more like this .
if the government &apos;s fis@@ cal survival depen@@ ds on it having to raise money from its own people , such a government is driven by self-@@ interest to gover@@ n in a more en@@ ligh@@ tened fashion .
we &apos;re beginning to look inside the brain .
be@@ au lot@@ to + am@@ y o &apos;@@ to@@ ole : science is for everyone , kids included
and i &apos;ve never seen anybody com@@ ment , looking at a football game , saying , &quot; all those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . &quot;
our lat@@ est ende@@ a@@ vor , with a gr@@ ant from the department of cor@@ rec@@ tions at washington state , they &apos;ve asked us to expand this program to three more pris@@ ons .
this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home .
all they had was mi@@ ke &apos;s hard le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent alco@@ hol .
there &apos;s few animals -- i think eleph@@ ants and ap@@ es can do that kind of thing -- but there are very few animals who can do that .
he gather@@ ed them together after an initial tour of that fac@@ ili@@ ty and he asked if there were any questions .
in@@ fr@@ in@@ gement is a lot easier to dis@@ prove .
so , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot;
my guess is , for what it &apos;s worth , is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years , 15 , but the context in which she holds her power has now radi@@ cally alter@@ ed ; it has radi@@ cally changed .
as long as we believe that people , our own neighbor@@ s , are sel@@ fish , stupid or la@@ zy , then there &apos;s no hope .
we can do bigger car st@@ unts than ever before now .
this will be a premi@@ ere today .
and when he dar@@ ed to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imag@@ ined .
and it was done in europe .
as i spo@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; you know what we need ? we really need a school for girls . &quot;
in this photograph a ho@@ sti@@ le crow@@ d in a sl@@ um surro@@ unds him .
&quot; promise anything to her , &quot; &quot; promise her anything , &quot; and so on .
here &apos;s one the russi@@ ans are already building that flo@@ ats on a bar@@ ge .
i had maybe nine months .
it looks like i got a bal@@ des@@ sar@@ i painting for free .
and what we found is very exciting .
day@@ an@@ anda sar@@ as@@ wat@@ i : the profound journey of compassion
i mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . right ?
this new computer , built to become the ner@@ ve center of a de@@ fen@@ se network , is able to per@@ form all the complex mathematical problems involved in counter@@ ing a mass ene@@ my raid .
they could have put them all out in view .
not an obvious path , she said to me , &quot; it &apos;s all connected .
and i would like it to be eth@@ iop@@ ia .
but that was not the end of the story .
we don &apos;t keep them all .
the poet au@@ den said , &quot; thousands have lived without love ; none without water . &quot;
we can tell who &apos;s going to get breast cancer from the various genes .
if you actually think , you re@@ move the my@@ th and there is still something wonderful .
she said , &quot; if you help me get money , i could open a house . &quot;
so you can click on things and re@@ move it .
what they did was they ho@@ o@@ ked up har@@ vard under@@ gradu@@ ates to an electric sho@@ ck machine .
his mother showed up the next week at my brother &apos;s class@@ room and beg@@ ged se@@ ven@@ -year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
i wanted to check to find out how he &apos;d calcul@@ ated this , and get the sour@@ ces and so forth .
and once you &apos;ve changed its state , it sta@@ ys there until you change its state again .
it was still governments telling people what to do .
even though they were lab@@ eled whale meat , they were dol@@ phin meat .
cause and effect .
does it really lead to a single an@@ c@@ est@@ or some 20 , 2@@ 5,000 years ago ?
basically what that means is , you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and explo@@ it to main@@ tain itself .
it &apos;s not the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ ot@@ ene , it &apos;s the car@@ rot .
in r@@ wand@@ a , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the cont@@ ents of prison@@ ers &apos; bo@@ wel@@ s .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind technology is we &apos;d have to take up r@@ ough@@ ly from the 10 to mul@@ h@@ oll@@ and , and from the 4@@ 0@@ 5 to la ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ ds .
they created pollution , they created od@@ ors , they were hard to control , the light was di@@ m , and they were a fire ha@@ z@@ ard .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
and michael flei@@ sch@@ man was another ph@@ .@@ d@@ . student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following obser@@ vation : that &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analy@@ zing how language conne@@ cts to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , de@@ b , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot;
i didn &apos;t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college .
so that means we could then start to develop different plat@@ forms for explor@@ ing this evolution .
i came to the heart institute in 200@@ 6 , as part of my elec@@ tive in my anes@@ thes@@ ia and inten@@ sive care program .
but you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power .
and what they found with the first se@@ a@@ water greenhouse that was built was it was produ@@ cing slightly more fres@@ h@@ water than it needed for the plants inside .
wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad water pollution and massive de@@ gra@@ dation of la@@ kes and ri@@ vers .
the consci@@ ous mind hun@@ gers for success and pre@@ stige .
18@@ 24 .
you &apos;ve got to create a system that will work better and better .
the reason i &apos;ve taken this time is i &apos;ve been fascinated to hear some of the reac@@ tions to this .
if mand@@ ela was the national and international em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment , then the man who taught me the most about this value person@@ ally was this man , sol@@ ly m@@ hl@@ on@@ go .
this is cultures , iden@@ tical cultures , of cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer cells .
now , if neurons are the func@@ tional information process@@ ing units of the brain , then the ow@@ ners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities .
ec@@ ologist eric ber@@ low doesn &apos;t feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med when fac@@ ed with complex systems . he knows that more information can lead to a better , sim@@ pl@@ er solution . illu@@ str@@ ating the ti@@ ps and tricks for breaking down big issues , he dist@@ ills an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming in@@ fo@@ graphic on u.s. strategy in afghanistan to a few element@@ ary points .
i &apos;m going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy , rather than against democracy .
it takes this wor@@ m two days to age as much as the normal wor@@ m ages in one day .
so again , this is an immedi@@ ate rel@@ ie@@ f .
it &apos;s just a matter of the con@@ sequences .
and it &apos;s my hope that some of these &quot; hope sp@@ ots &quot; can be in the deep ocean , an area that has histor@@ ically been seriously ne@@ gle@@ cted , if not ab@@ used .
thank you .
imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve raised -- maybe you &apos;re a politi@@ cian in a developing country and you have a budget to spend . you want to spend it on the poor : how do you go about it ?
and eventually , our worst ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are happened : they f@@ loo@@ ded the engine .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily for me , that home and the love inside of it , along with help from teachers , ment@@ ors and friends along the way , was enough .
today , food aid , our food aid -- huge engine -- 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world .
so he designed a pl@@ ot@@ ter as well , and , you know , at that point , i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine .
then of course , it goes into the ent@@ rap@@ ment device .
you could fight for your country , you could die for your country , you could serve in your country &apos;s civil service , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stron@@ ger society in the way that you do now .
so children ju@@ dge themselves , learn to ju@@ dge themselves , by the behavior of adul@@ ts around them .
what if we had an african television network that broad@@ c@@ ast di@@ verse african stories all over the world ?
to be able to compu@@ te answers to specific questions that people have , not by se@@ arch@@ ing what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compu@@ te fres@@ h new answers to specific questions .
i love this idea that came from the village level : three keys to un@@ lock that war@@ e@@ house .
bi@@ p@@ in des@@ ai is a u.@@ c. ri@@ ver@@ side theore@@ tical physicist who also happens to be the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent organi@@ zer of rare wine tast@@ ings , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a ta@@ sting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 ch@@ ev@@ al b@@ lan@@ c . &quot;
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states .
now , why is that a problem ?
we would be thri@@ ll@@ ed if we had one se@@ mit@@ one pit@@ ch perception in co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant users .
this is -- in other words , we never get the o-@@ h -- we never mista@@ ke it for an s-@@ h , ok ?
they dre@@ am@@ ed up a variety of horri@@ fying sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os .
because through your m@@ ask , they let thei@@ r@@ s go .
if you look at the word &quot; sal@@ vation &quot; in the bi@@ ble -- the chri@@ stian us@@ age that we &apos;re familiar with -- saving sou@@ ls , that people go to hea@@ ven -- that &apos;s actually a lat@@ e@@ com@@ er .
but this comple@@ ment may be much in@@ f@@ eri@@ or to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot;
but the next morning , while i was still in the hospital , i got a tele@@ phone call .
i call myself a body architect .
and i &apos;m not talking about los@@ ing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys .
and the network really matters .
but changing the way i thought about science was surpris@@ ingly easy . once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , i then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
so i made a we@@ ar@@ able wall that i could wear as a back@@ pack .
so what does this tell us ?
first one is the political system .
but as charlie m@@ unger says , &quot; if economics isn &apos;t behavi@@ oral , i don &apos;t know what the hell is . &quot;
it took focus . it took de@@ di@@ cation .
but it can also sound like this .
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ apping . all right ?
if you go forward the next 10 years and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a bar@@ re@@ l , you will pay 2.@@ 2 trillion .
ligh@@ ting architect ro@@ gi@@ er van der hei@@ de offers a beautiful new way to look at the world -- by pa@@ ying attention to light . examples from classi@@ c buildings illu@@ strate a deeply thou@@ gh@@ t-@@ out vision of the play of light around us . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the bott@@ les connect together , and you can create different shap@@ es , different forms .
so these are the kinds of la@@ yers , the kinds of questions i wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , what are the inten@@ tions that you bring to be@@ ar when you &apos;re designing something ?
and from them in the time sequence we &apos;re going to have to go from these tiny variations to these ir@@ regu@@ lar galaxies and first stars to these more advan@@ ced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simp@@ li@@ city gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
sometimes in rice we found incredible increas@@ es in yiel@@ d when you mix different var@@ ie@@ ties of rice side by side .
and then her ol@@ dest brother stood up and said , &quot; i too have something to tell you .
i would love to talk about my a@@ stronom@@ y , but i suspe@@ ct that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative transfer in non-@@ gray atmos@@ pher@@ es and pol@@ ari@@ zation of light in ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shel@@ ter .
i do know that education is a huge part of it .
it &apos;s something they feel imp@@ ell@@ ed to do because they care about it .
it &apos;s been a t@@ ough journey for me , traveling the world , telling my story in form of a book .
okay , now re@@ play this sc@@ ene now , and you &apos;re appro@@ aching the one who has language .
and especially she saw carto@@ ons of ker@@ mit the fro@@ g .
so the question is , what is the first question for designers ?
and finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called ur@@ p , for urban plan@@ ners , in which we give architects and urban plan@@ ners back the models that we con@@ fis@@ cated when we insi@@ sted that they use c@@ ad systems .
and i work a lot in what i call &quot; re@@ tro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism , &quot; which is looking back to see how yesterday vie@@ wed tomorrow .
we found 90 percent of the first decisi@@ on-@@ ma@@ kers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent re@@ turned some of it .
they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it .
they were making scary faces to play the car@@ ic@@ ature of themselves .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and dis@@ appeared into the shado@@ ws , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
i actually had my daughter -- gave her a t@@ ally coun@@ ter , and i gave her an assi@@ gn@@ ment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our house@@ hold .
we understand the scientific basis for the inter@@ rel@@ at@@ e@@ dness of life but our e@@ go hasn &apos;t caught up yet .
but here &apos;s another video that shows some of our challenges .
let me tell you something interesting .
and i really strug@@ gl@@ ed with this one .
mon@@ i@@ ka bu@@ la@@ j : the hidden light of afghanistan
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
we bring instru@@ ments in , from two separate cu@@ ts in the side , and then you can start mani@@ pul@@ ating tissue .
and they grow to be about this size .
there &apos;s no dis@@ course anymore .
it &apos;s a precise speci@@ fication with a precise for@@ mal language that causes mathema@@ tica to know what to do here .
that &apos;s the second land@@ mark .
and those little gray lines are the conne@@ ctions that connect them together .
but that is changing rap@@ i@@ dly with the aid of new genom@@ ic technology .
and so what i &apos;m going to show you is a three-@@ minute reader &apos;s di@@ gest version of the first aspe@@ ct of this film that we produced . it &apos;s an on@@ going project that &apos;s going to go another four or five years .
and she told me this , she said , &quot; we were in the train going to au@@ schwi@@ tz , and i looked down and saw my brother &apos;s sho@@ es were missing .
and they &apos;re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the by@@ product of their industry -- with os@@ b and partic@@ le board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of har@@ v@@ est in the forest if consum@@ ers are wa@@ sting the har@@ v@@ est at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
you see , technology is a way to evol@@ ve the evolution .
and in budd@@ h@@ ism , they cat@@ ch it in the future life .
because just that soil could make the ac@@ ou@@ stic difference .
it all began when i was only six years old , and my father taught me that my@@ steri@@ ous art of keeping sc@@ ore while listening to bas@@ e@@ ball games -- so that when he went to work in new york during the day , i could record for him the history of that after@@ noon &apos;s brooklyn dod@@ gers game .
here , maybe you &apos;ll have better lu@@ ck .
and that &apos;s what we use to in@@ je@@ ct , as we start to do our deep di@@ ves .
what i find amazing is that africa is trans@@ cen@@ ding its geo@@ graphy problem .
the model of the self that au@@ r@@ ora had in her mind has been exp@@ and@@ ed to get one more arm .
y you can also go to the website , answer -- respon@@ d to the questions also .
it takes about 10 cal@@ ories to produce every cal@@ or@@ ie of food that we consu@@ me in the west .
and what i &apos;ve discovered since is this : bu@@ lli@@ es use violence in three ways .
for them , of course , it can &apos;t possibly by mar@@ du@@ k that made all this happen .
so , basically you breath p@@ ure o@@ 2 first , oxy@@ gen@@ ating your body , fl@@ ush@@ ing out co2 , and you are able to hold much longer .
the fourth thing is labor is dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately more expensive than materials .
it &apos;s necessary and , just as important , it &apos;s good for the california economy .
kids -- you can see these sig@@ ns in kids .
how should we be making our decisions ?
now , we &apos;ve been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom .
it should be more like private accoun@@ ting .
you know , as we speak today , young people are being killed in sy@@ ri@@ a , and up until three months ago , if you were in@@ ju@@ red on the street , an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce would pick you up , take you to the hospital , you &apos;d go in , say , with a broken leg , and you &apos;d come out with a bul@@ let in your head .
with kids , it &apos;s hea@@ ven . &quot;
so i thought , okay , i &apos;ll start with five .
but it makes for good theater , and it &apos;s power@@ fully ca@@ th@@ arti@@ c as you probably saw last week .
so welcome to my home .
he &apos;s an architect , and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change .
they call it a mo@@ ai . and if you &apos;re in a mo@@ ai you &apos;re expected to share the boun@@ ty if you en@@ coun@@ ter lu@@ ck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , par@@ ent dies , you always have somebody who has your back .
and so , all the time you say , oh , i can predict the things .
and here &apos;s this , like , dirty , kind of , sho@@ d@@ dy , kind of , dark computer room .
iron@@ ically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation of difference , that uni@@ te us .
what good is more going to do ?
le@@ yma@@ h g@@ bo@@ we@@ e : un@@ lock the intelligence , passion , great@@ ness of girls
right ?
it &apos;s often been described because of its fra@@ gi@@ le nature and its complexity , as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation .
and there &apos;s different text .
and tom@@ as@@ z , a young poli@@ sh man said , &quot; i don &apos;t need tw@@ enty kinds of che@@ wing g@@ um .
so in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politi@@ cians are going to make on certain issues , are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politi@@ cians to repe@@ at their posi@@ tions , even the very wrong posi@@ tions , because consi@@ sten@@ cy is going to be more important than common sense ?
it is to explain death to a child , and it deser@@ ves a piece of pla@@ in-@@ song music . &quot;
and this light can be used to trans@@ mit wireless data that these things &#91; use &#93; to communicate with each other .
and they eat about eight times as much to@@ f@@ u as americ@@ ans do .
they &apos;re able to very quickly and very flexi@@ bly adap@@ t to new challenges and new resources in their environment , which is really useful if you live in a city .
and he said , &quot; this genetic resource , &quot; -- and i &apos;ll never forget the words -- &quot; stands between us and cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c starvation on a scale we cannot imagine . &quot;
we can also see the super@@ stars . these would be the people that are kind of the lo@@ om@@ ing hero@@ es and hero@@ ines in the universe of bill clin@@ ton . so there &apos;s bill clin@@ ton , h@@ ill@@ ary , iraq , george bush , barack obama , s@@ co@@ ot@@ er li@@ b@@ by -- these are kind of the people of bill clin@@ ton .
okay , for example , that &apos;s pal@@ est@@ ine .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circu@@ lation ?
this thing does something else which is un@@ usual .
a month ago today i stood there : 90 degrees south , the top of the bottom of the world , the geo@@ graphic south pole .
the teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they domin@@ ate the lea@@ gue by the time they &apos;re done .
i was faster but just as depres@@ sed .
it &apos;s a great honor to be here talking about cities , talking about the future of cities .
this is called the cap@@ gras del@@ usion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head in@@ jury , comes out of com@@ a , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; this looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or .
and as i grew up , i heard so much knowledge and so many insi@@ ghts and so much wisdom come out around this table , i began to call it the wisdom table .
these are stim@@ uli i &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
you &apos;re allowed to have an elec@@ ted government , colle@@ ct tax@@ es , provide m@@ uni@@ cip@@ al services , and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
as she says , &quot; it &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
instead , the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies , as they interact , have produced the pres@@ um@@ ption that these activities are illegal .
we &apos;re , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image .
but , &quot; a very important but , &quot; i love christ@@ mas car@@ ols .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily he agre@@ ed . and the theme , in two years , is going to be &quot; c@@ ute pictures of pupp@@ ies . &quot;
but we can change how it was interpre@@ ted , because it was interpre@@ ted according to the time and mi@@ lie@@ u in the middle ages .
climate change has affected the world for a long period of time , and gradu@@ ally , the forests dis@@ appeared , the country began to dry out , and the number of kinds of thy@@ l@@ ac@@ ines began to decl@@ ine , until by five million years ago , only one left .
articles on contro@@ versi@@ al top@@ ics are edi@@ ted a lot , but they don &apos;t cause much contro@@ vers@@ y within the community .
i know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
and it shows that the ocean , because of its va@@ st@@ ness , can hi@@ de secre@@ ts for a very long time .
it &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
i &apos;d put out feel@@ ers to re@@ tail@@ ers , to au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers , and it was coming up empty .
they fli@@ p the negative .
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl , and he said , &quot; clean . &quot;
and i con@@ clu@@ ded , after resear@@ ching every other technology that we could dep@@ lo@@ y for stor@@ ing energy -- fl@@ y@@ whe@@ els , different for@@ mu@@ lations of batter@@ ies -- it just wasn &apos;t practical to store energy .
school drop@@ out rate is up to 70 percent .
these are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iphone when they first came out , when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shel@@ f .
my life completely changed when i found a spot wel@@ der .
that &apos;s absolutely the right thing , for people to follow their self-@@ interest .
and this changes everything .
each one of these genes has potential diagno@@ stic test .
so for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regu@@ lar newspaper .
so i said to him , &quot; do you want to come with me ?
i wanted to make po@@ sters , not newsp@@ ap@@ ers .
so we decided to see if flies could be pro@@ vo@@ ked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the pro@@ ver@@ bial was@@ p at the pic@@ ni@@ c table , you know , the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vi@@ gor@@ ously you try to s@@ w@@ at it away , and it seems to keep getting irri@@ t@@ ated .
small animals eat insects .
and at this time , when i was going through what i call my &quot; pre-@@ mid-@@ life crisis , &quot; africa was a mess .
per@@ u@@ vi@@ ans love japanese wo@@ od@@ block prin@@ ts .
this is a bu@@ ck@@ min@@ ster@@ ful@@ ler@@ ene , a carb@@ on-@@ 60 .
with vi@@ br@@ ant video cli@@ ps cap@@ tured by sub@@ mar@@ ines , david g@@ all@@ o takes us to some of earth &apos;s dar@@ k@@ est , most violent , tox@@ ic and beautiful hab@@ it@@ ats , the val@@ le@@ ys and vol@@ c@@ anic ri@@ d@@ ges of the oceans &apos; dep@@ ths , where life is bi@@ zar@@ re , res@@ ili@@ ent and sho@@ ck@@ ingly ab@@ und@@ ant .
and another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like &quot; am i dr@@ un@@ k ? &quot;
the influence -- and if you have noticed , one of my sp@@ her@@ es of influence is biology -- is from a gras@@ sh@@ op@@ per .
what happens is two-@@ thirds of the kids give in to temp@@ tation .
i got into this business designing products .
and when you look at what happens to that pi@@ pel@@ ine , you start out maybe with thousands , tens of thousands of com@@ pounds .
and so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a res@@ pir@@ atory virus chip .
and let &apos;s just pick out a few elements .
both my parents were edu@@ cat@@ ors , my mat@@ ern@@ al grand@@ parents were edu@@ cat@@ ors , and for the past 40 years i &apos;ve done the same thing .
why did we use that word , science ?
and i think it &apos;s particularly pain@@ ful for us now in the west in the gri@@ ps of what i sometimes think of as a contro@@ l-@@ z culture -- contro@@ l-@@ z like the computer comm@@ and , un@@ do .
so instead , i decided to go for a lab .
you look at some other scientific revolu@@ tions , and this case , i &apos;m talking about the solar system , that &apos;s c@@ oper@@ nic@@ us , darwin &apos;s evolution , and te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic pl@@ ates , that &apos;s we@@ gen@@ er .
and@@ re@@ a is one .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
and then we went home . we &apos;d sort of done it .
and i would get har@@ ass@@ ed sometimes .
so they introduced me to five families .
not many people can say that .
well , in order to fly , just as in a human aircraft , you need wings that can generate suffi@@ cient a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic forces , you need an engine suffi@@ cient to generate the power required for flight , and you need a controll@@ er , and in the first human aircraft , the controll@@ er was basically the brain of or@@ ville and wil@@ bu@@ r sitting in the co@@ ck@@ p@@ it .
give them an extra mix up .
we really don &apos;t know .
so we developed a different approach .
and that sounds really heavy , but in the last five or 10 years , 15 years , how have there been some decisions you &apos;ve made that if you &apos;d made a different decision , your life would be completely different ? how many can think about it ?
i work for the new yor@@ ker , and i do cover@@ s , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and ut@@ ter end of the world as we knew it .
student 4@@ l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sp@@ on@@ ge ball because they &apos;re two totally different wei@@ ghts , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
it was a thousand hall@@ el@@ u@@ ja@@ h@@ s and a million om@@ s .
we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .
the first one was done in new del@@ hi in 199@@ 9 .
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
and millions of children die of these diseases every year .
you give it a p@@ at behind the e@@ ars , and everything is all right again .
his de@@ di@@ cation inspired me to come up with this expedition : a run to the south pole where , with an inter@@ active website , i will be able to bring young people , students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me , as active members .
out of four bri@@ tish people , three said that they were optimi@@ stic about the future of their own families .
thanks .
we happen to get ro@@ und to te@@ sting , let &apos;s say , newton &apos;s law of gra@@ vity about 300 years ago .
and radio waves are limited .
juan en@@ ri@@ que@@ z : will our kids be a different species ?
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
for those without dis@@ abilities , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated according to age and gender , they are arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily separated from their si@@ bl@@ ings , often without even a chance to say goo@@ d@@ by@@ e .
exactly what lo@@ an@@ ing means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
when i made the anno@@ un@@ c@@ ement , george did not turn ros@@ y , but went p@@ ale as my dou@@ b@@ let .
it is a technology that em@@ power@@ s the individual to determine its own life course , to shape itself .
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
which is an area along the am@@ ur river , which is up here .
one was that i realized , oh my g@@ os@@ h , i don &apos;t feel like that anymore . you know .
we have a successful company because of ti@@ ming , and because of per@@ sever@@ ance , but it &apos;s simple stuff -- it &apos;s not ro@@ cket science .

what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many ?
this is a photo of a le@@ m@@ on shar@@ k pu@@ p , and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these prote@@ ctive man@@ gro@@ ves .

kt : yes .
when i bought my first desk@@ top , it was a de@@ c rain@@ bow .
they were really looking for us , the designers , to create the s@@ kin@@ s , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box .
to hear this di@@ alo@@ gue that &apos;s just increasing in ten@@ or and vel@@ o@@ city , of decisions about trade and companies wan@@ ting to come .
she &apos;s being fil@@ med with a hidden camera .
we don &apos;t seem to have a word for that .
the question is : why are we still in afghanistan one decade later ?
now that &apos;s something i fall short of on a daily basis .
but that &apos;s what the rain bo@@ ots are for , because rain will was@@ h away everything , if you let it .
i gave you three simple answers to three questions : give l@@ enti@@ ls to imm@@ uni@@ ze people , provide free bed nets , de@@ wor@@ m children .
am@@ at@@ eur@@ s can do it also .
this guy on the left , dr. richard be@@ ver@@ ley cole , he lived in phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a and he took the pan@@ ama rou@@ te .
secon@@ dly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world -- which i think is what china will become -- will be not from the west and from very , very different civili@@ za@@ tional roots .
or you can r@@ amp up and go up to 50 stars on a fla@@ g , with 13 stri@@ p@@ es .
today we don &apos;t con@@ front the chaos of nature .
and so from that we can produce these tra@@ cks .
because without these kinds of people we can &apos;t have places like this .
&quot; bad sp@@ elling , in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness as well as in@@ elegan@@ ce of expression in writing . &quot;
you &apos;ll find a sta@@ ir that &apos;s the same l@@ ength as the su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t .

thank you .
so he said , &quot; i told them about nap@@ o@@ le@@ on and al@@ ex@@ ander the great and fre@@ deri@@ ck the great and ju@@ li@@ us ca@@ es@@ ar , and they loved it .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully func@@ tioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . it &apos;s actually available on the market .
every student knows what &apos;s required to be successful .
this is an en@@ core he used to do .
and let &apos;s put it back into the de@@ ck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
just as that woman tried to k@@ is@@ s my feet when we were taking her sons .
and the organis@@ ms , i promise you , have all of their pri@@ orities in order .
well , to go back to our original story , the parents have p@@ ani@@ cked . they &apos;ve lo@@ cked all the do@@ ors .
i had just left wall street , cut my hair to look like margaret me@@ ad , given away most everything that i ow@@ ned , and arrived with all the essenti@@ als -- some po@@ e@@ try , a few clothes , and , of course , a guit@@ ar -- because i was going to save the world , and i thought i would just start with the african contin@@ ent .
there was a lot of people there -- the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful come to be in their -- whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs and cru@@ t@@ ches , and so on .
one , two , three , four fol@@ ds we make .
j@@ ac@@ ek ut@@ ko is an extraordinary poli@@ sh newspaper designer whose re@@ designs for pap@@ ers in eastern europe not only win a@@ wards , but increase circu@@ lation by up to 100 % . can good design save the newspaper ? it just might .
one of my favorite brain stories described these midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged guys .
the cur@@ ved line is very similar to the le@@ x@@ ig@@ ram .
girl : oh my god !
if we had , our brains probably would percei@@ ve rocks as full of empty space . rocks feel hard and im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ able to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot pen@@ et@@ rate each other . it &apos;s therefore useful for our brains to constru@@ ct no@@ tions like &quot; soli@@ di@@ ty &quot; and &quot; im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ability , &quot; because such no@@ tions help us to navi@@ gate our bodies through the midd@@ le-@@ si@@ zed world in which we have to navi@@ gate .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular ac@@ ute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyram@@ id problem .
i remember vivi@@ dly the week it all came together .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
most of all , i was just surprised with what i was finding .
i would create a la@@ d@@ der to use to get up on top of the tree .
now both of these options -- the boy genius and the sc@@ am@@ mer -- and therefore more pr@@ one to taking even bigger ris@@ ks in the future .
actually as was pointed out earlier , we forget about all the strug@@ gle there was in getting there .
i had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour .
and thank you very much .
but suppose you take some di@@ rt and dig through it and then put it into these spec@@ tro@@ meters , because there &apos;s bacteria all over the place ; or you take water anywhere on earth , because it &apos;s te@@ aming with life , and you make the same analysis ; the spectrum looks completely different .
and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yeah . or maybe you &apos;re the only one who had to go to the ba@@ th@@ room . &quot;
and on one particular day , the cam@@ pers were jum@@ ping through inner tu@@ bes , they were di@@ ving through inner tu@@ bes . and i thought this would be great fun .
so again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
we &apos;re also working on more sop@@ hi@@ sticated pr@@ inter@@ s .

it &apos;s never &quot; the go@@ d@@ father ; &quot; it &apos;s never &quot; citi@@ zen kan@@ e ; &quot; it &apos;s always some third rate movie with some second rate star .
and i thought that if pattern can uni@@ te these dis@@ par@@ ate elements , it can do just about anything .
thank you .
now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ stra@@ ct like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te metaphor .
the experiments had to be wrong , and they were .
and i have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be su@@ bli@@ m@@ ated to other needs .
you see , he had hero@@ es , like ram -- ra@@ gh@@ u@@ pat@@ i ram and kris@@ hn@@ a , go@@ vin@@ da har@@ i .

we can mate , so i &apos;m going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me . yeah .
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be .
that &apos;s between , say at an average use , that &apos;s maybe 2@@ 5,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
our problem is that we are separated from our cre@@ ator , which we call god , and we need to have our sou@@ ls re@@ stor@@ ed , something only god can do .
and it &apos;s one of the nic@@ est pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
so if we &apos;re somewhere in the northern he@@ mis@@ phere , look at what &apos;s happening to the ultra@@ vio@@ let radi@@ ation .
nine months later i found myself spra@@ ying messa@@ ges in tahri@@ r square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my new@@ s@@ feed .
l@@ b : well , you know , as r@@ on st. john -- i hope you &apos;ll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him -- when he started g@@ phin -- in 1997 , there was an outbreak of bird flu .
what set up with zip@@ car -- zip@@ car started in 2000 .
my name is dan co@@ hen , and i am acade@@ mic , as he said .
this type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
she said that the hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations were un@@ related to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or dis@@ appear .
the color was added for two reasons .
and i kept thinking over and over in my mind , what had happened ? where did it go wrong ? why didn &apos;t i understand ?
from having no water what@@ so@@ ever to consum@@ ing water to the high@@ est degree , higher than any other nation .
but see all those different working things ?
now here , on one website , one state in america , every single dollar spent by that government is se@@ arch@@ able , is analy@@ z@@ able , is check@@ able .
ju@@ an@@ it@@ a is her name .
so i said , &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot;
it &apos;s really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening , and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends .
cricket wasn &apos;t always this spee@@ d-@@ driven generations game .
and so we took the language of this ex@@ posed steel and used it , per@@ ver@@ ted it , into the form of the fish , and created a kind of a 19@@ th-@@ century contr@@ ap@@ tion that looks like , that will sit -- this is the beach and the har@@ bor out in front , and this is really a sh@@ opp@@ ing center with department stor@@ es .
that &apos;s all for now .

&quot; looking for the buddha in person , &quot; he said .
so it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile , and it was dum@@ b lu@@ ck . we were working on i@@ bot@@ s , but once we made this , we inst@@ antly decided it could be a great alternative to je@@ t sk@@ is . you don &apos;t need the water .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loo@@ p : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indi@@ c@@ ate .
they &apos;re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that class and they &apos;ll give you the grade . &quot;
&quot; de@@ ar sir , good day , compli@@ ments of the day , and my best wi@@ sh@@ es to you and family . i know this letter will come to you surpris@@ ingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arri@@ ving un@@ anno@@ un@@ ced , and , as an a@@ da@@ ge says , origin@@ als are very hard to find , but their e@@ cho@@ es sound lou@@ der . so i decided to cont@@ act you myself , for you to ass@@ ure me of safety and hon@@ est@@ y , if i have to ent@@ r@@ ust any amount of money under your cu@@ sto@@ dy .
convin@@ ce just 100 key companies to go sustainable , and w@@ w@@ f &apos;s jason clay says global markets will shi@@ ft to protect the planet our consumption has already out@@ gro@@ wn . hear how his extraordinary ro@@ und@@ tables are getting big brand ri@@ v@@ als to agree on green practic@@ es first -- before their products du@@ ke it out on store shel@@ ves .
so , i lo@@ cked myself in a room , figu@@ red out the content , organized the docum@@ ent , and wrote it in pla@@ in english .

how shall we in@@ scri@@ be in@@ tent on all the objects we create , on all the cir@@ cum@@ stan@@ ces we create , on all the places we change ?
because not many people are really going to read archi@@ medes in an@@ cient gre@@ ek , but they should have the chance to do it .
and this is main@@ frame healthcare .
it &apos;s wrong to take his phone because he &apos;s a person and he has rights and he has dignity , and we can &apos;t just inter@@ f@@ ere with that .
there are 1,@@ 600 people , i believe .
they felt pretty stupid , so they started sen@@ ding in their repor@@ ts earlier .
i off@@ ered five cents each for bottle cap@@ s .
j@@ n : i see . and who is that ?
she fo@@ unded the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement .
and so what i &apos;m about to show you is an accurate repres@@ entation of the actual dna repli@@ cation machine that &apos;s oc@@ curr@@ ing right now inside your body , at least 200@@ 2 biology .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a water drop@@ let .
&quot; v@@ ali@@ ci@@ a . &quot;
and your children are playing instru@@ ments .
it &apos;s the precise amount of har@@ m that comes to media companies whenever a single copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted song or movie gets pir@@ ated .
that iran was once a se@@ cu@@ lar society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stol@@ en from us by the american government , by the bri@@ tish government .
i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separ@@ ation of children from their families .
you have tissue culture cells . there are a ton of vir@@ uses .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; here &apos;s your solution . thanks very much . next . &quot;
i mean , there &apos;s been this u.s. intelligence analy@@ st , bra@@ d@@ ley man@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ sted , and it &apos;s alle@@ ged that he conf@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 classi@@ fied u.s. em@@ b@@ ass@@ y cab@@ les .
this is an idea that we got from a fellow ted@@ ster here , dan den@@ ne@@ tt , who talked about taking the inten@@ tional stance .
the average dep@@ th at the top of it is about a mile and a half .
is this something that other people can do ?
and i thought , &quot; these ants , are they looking for the queen ant ?
and he created these gor@@ ge@@ ous buildings where you can see the sky , and where you can experience the sun , that give us a better life in the built environment , just because of the relev@@ ance of light in its bri@@ ght@@ ness and also in its shado@@ ws .
when we think about accidents , we usually consider them to be harm@@ ful , unfortunate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
the difference was , or@@ ville and wil@@ bu@@ r were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
you can &apos;t do very much learning in your own life , it &apos;s so short , and there &apos;s nobody to pass on what you do learn .
they &apos;d wor@@ n themselves out , be@@ ating themselves against the window , i took them outside and as i let them go , that spli@@ t second , even though they were very ti@@ red , that second i let them go they ho@@ vered for a second , then zi@@ pped off into the distance .
can i request a moment of absol@@ ute silence ?
as you get further and further away from the pu@@ m@@ p , the de@@ a@@ ths begin to grow less and less frequ@@ ent .
they tell us about our world in a lot of different ways , and particularly the ocean .
stories matter .
i suppor@@ ted the war in iraq .
it &apos;s the first mission that &apos;s going to try to land near the north pole of mars , and it &apos;s the first mission that &apos;s actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet .
for the true selves of companies to come through , open@@ ness is par@@ amount , but radi@@ cal open@@ ness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
and in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
i started working on it in 198@@ 5 , and it &apos;s been evol@@ ving very slowly .
and it si@@ ts in the mem@@ bran@@ e of the cell and it &apos;s got a por@@ e in it .
it will be launched next september .
so when two up quar@@ ks and a down quar@@ k are combined to make a pro@@ ton , it has a total electric char@@ ge of plus one .
so it &apos;s really un@@ expla@@ ined as to why we need to put it in .
and he would actually say , while he was be@@ ating me , &quot; don &apos;t you c@@ ry . don &apos;t you d@@ are c@@ ry . &quot;
here &apos;s an a@@ eri@@ al photograph of one of the an@@ as@@ a@@ z@@ i ru@@ ins ; you can see it &apos;s circu@@ lar at the largest scale , but it &apos;s rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar at the smaller scale , right ?
with no money to f@@ und my studies , i sc@@ aled new hei@@ ghts .
six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .

these things are fa@@ int .
and the air ar@@ ma@@ ment center at e@@ gl@@ in air force base in florida is responsible for the dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ment and te@@ sting of all air@@ -@@ delivered weap@@ on@@ ry coming from the united states .
you have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen .
now this is not something that &apos;s ready for the public , but it is in working progress .
you know , you buy that vi@@ king range , this is what your kitchen will look like .
so this is a blog de@@ voted to unfortunate portra@@ it@@ ure .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve all seen or heard this before : &quot; we , the willing , have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now quali@@ fied to do anything with nothing . &quot;
the longer i stayed in the hospital , the si@@ cker i became , and the more expensive it became , and this happens to millions of people around the world every year .
they tell us to have a bath .
and unique high-@@ an@@ kle design and human@@ -@@ like looks , &#91; unclear &#93; and functions .
and the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the micro@@ phone in her face , said , &quot; what do you mean by that ? &quot;
you &apos;re all welcome to join .
and so this is fi@@ ve-@@ foot , fi@@ ve-@@ in@@ ches of fr@@ ost that she left behind .
it turns out that those aren &apos;t the things that are really di@@ stra@@ cting .
just to make it a little bit more exciting .
he wanted to make that which was expensive free .
and my ti@@ ming was not great either : 2005 , when i did the atlan@@ tic , was the year of hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e kat@@ r@@ ina .
it &apos;s about each person coming to this platform , embra@@ cing it in their own way , and being significant in their own life .
and then , in ad@@ dition to that , at the same time , hand tools were re@@ placed by massive electric tools and hand-@@ powered electric tools , all achie@@ ved by electricity .
we &apos;d be different , our charac@@ ters would be different , if our neuro@@ -@@ an@@ atom@@ y and our physi@@ ological chemistry were different .
but drag@@ on@@ flies are not the only creatures that make the cros@@ sing .
you say it long enough , it starts to be a part of you .
so when i had my ted wish last year , i said , look , i &apos;m going to switch my concept .
think of models of terror@@ ism , child ki@@ dn@@ apping , air@@ line safety , car safety .
tur@@ bo &apos;s never been fed .
you do . i do .
so i &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergen@@ ce and development of non@@ violent movements in the west bank , ga@@ za and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be pal@@ est@@ ine .
we could actually go to may@@ flo@@ wer to ei@@ sen@@ ho@@ wer , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is ri@@ ghtly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneur@@ s , but also have the collap@@ sing countries .
cognitive resear@@ cher nan@@ cy et@@ co@@ ff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it , the way it &apos;s un@@ te@@ ther@@ ed to our real cir@@ cum@@ stan@@ ces , and its surprising effect on our bodies .
and i spr@@ in@@ ted home , and i didn &apos;t fall , and i didn &apos;t crash .
and that &apos;s how my relationship with corruption really began .
but they concent@@ rate in the gulf and then fan out all across the ar@@ ctic .
i mean , prob@@ ability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gam@@ bling .
as a young repor@@ ter , i thought that i should do it in a different way , so that it has a max@@ imum impact , since everybody knew that it was happening , and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system .
but more importantly , they discovered edi@@ fi@@ ces down there that they did not understand .
they just aren &apos;t , it &apos;s a bad deal .
for example : why is apple so innovative ?
i &apos;ve seen people have &quot; punk farm &quot; bir@@ th@@ day par@@ ties , people have dres@@ sed up as &quot; punk farm &quot; for hal@@ lo@@ ween , a &quot; punk farm &quot; baby room , which makes me a little nervous for the child &apos;s well-@@ being in the long term .
how do we em@@ power her with simple tools that &apos;s not diagno@@ stic but more scre@@ ening in nature so she at least knows how to adv@@ ise the patients better ?
so they pick a shape they like -- like a diam@@ ond , or a square , or a tri@@ ang@@ le , or a tr@@ ap@@ e@@ zo@@ id -- and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape , and the next larger shape .
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21@@ st century .
two thirds are not saving now .
these were money taken out in su@@ it@@ cases or in con@@ tain@@ ers , in c@@ ash of course .
they &apos;re magnificent . you see leon@@ ardo at work .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
and one of the things that came out -- alli@@ son , who actually nom@@ in@@ ated me , said something earlier on in a brain@@ stor@@ ming . she said that re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ing in can@@ ada had a fantastic ent@@ ry into our psy@@ che through kids between grade four and six .
will ge@@ e@@ ks become endangered species ?
but more than that , people are building green houses around green school , so their kids can walk to school on the pa@@ ths .
there &apos;s a political and social question out of this .
we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
and every time the h@@ ul@@ a ho@@ op would s@@ mus@@ h against her body , it would connect two little pieces of cop@@ per t@@ ape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loo@@ p the same sounds over and over again .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and here &apos;s the photo . right . lab@@ eled , &quot; bad day at work . &quot;
and this is what happens to that food web when it &apos;s sto@@ cked with non-@@ native fish that never lived there before .
so how did a city like this feed itself ?
that was not what was going on .
and on ju@@ ly 7@@ th , around the world , i learned only yesterday , there will be global live earth concer@@ ts .
and i looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when i was working at the electron@@ ic music studio !
and whether it &apos;s in the expression of a gre@@ ek sculp@@ ture that re@@ minds you of a friend , or a dog po@@ op@@ ing in the corner of a tap@@ e@@ stry , or , to bring it back to my tu@@ tor pie@@ tr@@ o , those dan@@ cing fig@@ ures who are indeed kno@@ cking back the wine , and that nu@@ de figure in the left fore@@ ground .
right . we &apos;re now able to do that kind of thing with groups .
and what we need to do is re@@ connect with those really pri@@ mal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say , &quot; you know , i think i would like to put c@@ ds across the wall there .
we can , for example , go find mik@@ o &apos;s lo@@ cker and get some more information about her .
but they had great diversity , and , inside , great complexity .
now , i would talk about one particular such plan that i know something about , but i don &apos;t want to viol@@ ate ted &apos;s first comm@@ and@@ ment of selling , so i &apos;m not going to talk about this at all .
i had no idea there were so many belie@@ vers at a ted conference .
central manhattan became possible .
he has no book@@ ings left .
so you see how trans@@ forma@@ tive little bits of help can be .
the positive perspective , i think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things .
but if you &apos;re trying to generate solar energy in a sta@@ tic place the weight doesn &apos;t matter so much .
we &apos;re not a mira@@ cle , okay ?
and that &apos;s not always going to happen in physical spac@@ es .
and we rel@@ eas@@ ed to youtube this , the virtual cho@@ ir project , 18@@ 5 sing@@ ers from 12 different countries .
this was an incredible , co@@ ordin@@ ated global response .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you hit print -- and this is from 14@@ 50 , by the way -- all of the arti@@ facts of modern com@@ ics start to present themselves : rec@@ ti@@ line@@ ar pan@@ el ar@@ ran@@ gem@@ ents , simple line drawings without t@@ one and a le@@ ft-@@ to-@@ right reading sequence .
thank you .
when people i knew , you know , people who consi@@ dered themselves liberal , and everything else , were making fun of jen@@ ni@@ fer flowers and pau@@ la jones .
this is how you hold the nee@@ d@@ le .
right now , 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the u.n. , and then given pri@@ mar@@ ily to people around africa .
and if i had to pick a group that i think is our invisible college , is our generation &apos;s collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service , not for more argu@@ ments , but for better argu@@ ments , i &apos;d pick the open-@@ source program@@ mers .
they &apos;ve been swe@@ pt away over the last two decades by these types of world-@@ fl@@ atten@@ ing digiti@@ zation technologies , right ?
but i want to tell you what the con@@ go has got to do with you .
i do like sym@@ pathy . i do like magic .
ready ?
when we hold our babies for the first time , we might imagine that they &apos;re clean sl@@ ates , un@@ mar@@ ked by life , when in fact , they &apos;ve already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in .
this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice .
so as we are fac@@ ing all the multiple cris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titu@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ veness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
i &apos;m doing this as a dem@@ o , and it &apos;s more play@@ ful , but ine@@ vit@@ ably , all of this can be used .
the tri@@ ck here is my brother would become an experim@@ ent@@ al poet , not a busin@@ ess@@ man , but the inten@@ tion was really good .
have you ever had any diseases ?
that &apos;s because we afri@@ c@@ ans concent@@ rate -- i am from eth@@ iop@@ ia , by the way -- we concent@@ rate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere , or from outside .
which lea@@ ds me to my second passion besi@@ des ocean science , which is ou@@ ter space technology .
and also , i began to be fascinated by machines -- you know , like copy machines -- and so this is actually in bas@@ el .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
as the number one market for lux@@ ury br@@ ands -- that &apos;s not including the chinese expen@@ di@@ tures in europe and elsewhere .
most laws are national in their imple@@ ment@@ ation , despite cyber@@ cri@@ me conven@@ tions , where the internet is bor@@ der@@ less and international by definition .
we all have come from a long way , here in africa , and conver@@ ged in this region of africa , which is a place where 90 percent of our evolu@@ tionary process took place .
so let &apos;s talk about the personal story for a moment .
ok , school .
there is something about clothes , i think , and sho@@ es .
do they , for inst@@ ance , capture rain@@ water so that we can reduce water use ?
you can buy half a billion today , and they are actually better , because they are faster .
the other is power diff@@ usion , the way power is moving from all states west or east to non-@@ state ac@@ tors .
actually , that &apos;s a docum@@ ent@@ ary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something -- somebody you &apos;re kind of vie@@ wing as alien , who &apos;s doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do the things they do is a mor@@ ally re@@ de@@ em@@ ing ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment , because you &apos;ve got to rel@@ ate their experience to y@@ ours .
thanks to my ancestors for rob@@ bing me of my invention .
it &apos;s just that , whereas that device rel@@ ies on pul@@ ses of in@@ fr@@ ared light , your language rel@@ ies on pul@@ ses , dis@@ cre@@ te pul@@ ses , of sound .
so thank you very much .
we look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
and so what this is , is we &apos;re taking a cros@@ s-@@ section of her body here , and you can see in the middle there is her heart , and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will inv@@ ade and will kill her , un@@ treated , in a matter of weeks .
you &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tricks .
the oper@@ ator says , &quot; just take it easy .
people fear them -- they help the re@@ bel@@ li@@ on a lot .
so first , nothing , nothing , nothing .
and they &apos;ve actually issu@@ ed a pil@@ ot &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se -- a power@@ li@@ ft pil@@ ot &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se -- for this type of aircraft .
i think the joke is that k@@ hat@@ ang@@ a isn &apos;t the end of the world , but you can see it from there .
they all have bank accoun@@ ts .
so what if we could just take these chan@@ nel@@ r@@ ho@@ dop@@ s@@ ins and other molecules and inst@@ all them on some of these other sp@@ are cells and conver@@ t them into little camer@@ as .
journal@@ ism had provided a chan@@ ne@@ l for people &apos;s natural sense of gener@@ osity , and the rea@@ ders respon@@ ded .
she said that the last time she had done it was on the dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land tra@@ m .
who among us would actually say that people read this ?
m@@ ck@@ im published a paper in 196@@ 6 , descri@@ bing an experiment that he and his colleagues condu@@ cted to test the effects of psy@@ che@@ del@@ ic drugs on creativity .
so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and re@@ active , i create a ball , a roll@@ ing ball able to analy@@ ze and find where does aggressi@@ ve sound come from , and roll , at home or at work , towards aggressi@@ ve noise , and em@@ its white noise in order to neu@@ tr@@ alize it .
and they left .
since then our aid has hal@@ ved .
not only do they supp@@ ress the dop@@ am@@ ine circu@@ it , but they kill the sex drive .
and you norm@@ ally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve ex@@ hau@@ sted the l@@ umin@@ escence when we bring them up in nets .
so , if not us , then who ?
when have you been ap@@ pointed to play god ?
put that another way -- of all of them who test positive -- so here they are , the individuals involved -- less than one in 100 actually have the disease .
i found other re@@ ference . a@@ vi &#91; ar@@ a &#93; che@@ k@@ may@@ an , a new jer@@ sey edi@@ tor , actually found this res@@ in mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on at a fle@@ a market in 199@@ 1 , although it took him five years to auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ate this bird to the au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers &apos; speci@@ fi@@ cations , because there was a lot of contro@@ vers@@ y about it .
not running from loss , but ent@@ ering g@@ rie@@ f , sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to sor@@ row .
now if you managed to rise up -- say , and be that local leader , the guy who &apos;s the equivalent of the mcdonald &apos;s fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ee -- you &apos;d be making 100,000 dollars a year .
how will you co@@ ok your chicken now ?
and here studying , in three dimensions , how to give some kind , again , of order , a structure ; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .
but war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the dr@@ c .
you c@@ ant hit your el@@ bow on bottom .
so if these images are uncomfortable to you or dist@@ ur@@ bing to you , that means we did the right job .
and we actually used the combin@@ ation of the satelli@@ te images and the ro@@ ver to actually condu@@ ct science , because we can ob@@ serve large areas and then you can get those ro@@ vers to move around and basically go to a certain location .
so with that , maybe i can switch back to the world .
se@@ ba@@ stian : draw thy s@@ word .
so@@ c : i , in my research , have seen that the taliban have perfe@@ cted the way in which they rec@@ ru@@ it and train children , and i think it &apos;s a fi@@ ve-@@ step process .
it ho@@ o@@ ks up all parts of the brain .
it is a ch@@ ess game .
i also use it as a tool for visu@@ ali@@ zing and tra@@ cking pollution .
as@@ ho@@ k : you also encoura@@ ged me to work .
camp@@ three is at the base of l@@ hot@@ se , which is the fourth high@@ est mountain in the world , but it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fed by everest .
a thin film will cre@@ ep up the inside wall , flow over the top and right out the outside .
i &apos;m a per@@ former .
we did our due di@@ li@@ gen@@ ce .
there &apos;s a dre@@ ad@@ ful fun@@ gu@@ s that &apos;s sort of moving and it &apos;s na@@ iling fro@@ gs all over the world .
and from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fis@@ her re@@ turns it for a thousand@@ -@@ dollar re@@ ward , we can get tra@@ cks ben@@ e@@ ath the sea for up to five years now , on a back@@ bon@@ ed animal .
but you can &apos;t even expand more , no , because chinese sin@@ a weib@@ o , when it was fo@@ unded was exactly one month after the official blo@@ cking of twi@@ tter@@ .com .
how do we solve it ?
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a cur@@ ved surface ?
if life has ar@@ is@@ en on only one planet in the entire universe , that planet has to be our planet , because here we are talking about it .
you can today down@@ load a product with software like this , view the product in 3d .
most afri@@ c@@ ans today , by far , are farmers .
that &apos;s a big sk@@ ull .
it has the chemical sequences of amin@@ o acids , which says , &quot; this is how to build the structure .
you can im@@ plant it in the body without nee@@ ding to re@@ trie@@ ve what is implan@@ ted .
they &apos;re killing each other .
what are we supposed to do ?
and if you think about space , everything we hold of value on this planet -- met@@ als and miner@@ als and real est@@ ate and energy -- is in infin@@ ite quanti@@ ties in space .
maj@@ ora car@@ ter : gre@@ ening the g@@ he@@ t@@ to
so we know for our 17@@ ,000 manag@@ ers across i@@ ke@@ a that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to sen@@ ior management .
if we are going to stop the spread of hiv in our life@@ time , then that is the change we need to spread .
she chas@@ ed that big se@@ al away , went and got its pengu@@ in and brought it to me .
millions of women live like this today .
as howard lo@@ ves to say , &quot; the mind knows not what the ton@@ gue wants . &quot;
and i had this idea : if i could get 50 people to all do this same thing , sing their parts -- sop@@ ran@@ o , al@@ to , ten@@ or and b@@ ass -- wher@@ ever they were in the world , post their videos to youtube , we could cut it all together and create a virtual cho@@ ir .
so babies and young children are very bad at nar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
i can hard@@ ly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was ac@@ ting .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechan@@ ism , called red@@ d plus -- a sche@@ me for the redu@@ ced emis@@ sions from de@@ forest@@ ation and forest de@@ gra@@ dation .
we thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against .
so how can we per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate this pion@@ e@@ ering spirit with something that will be independent from fossi@@ l energy ?
it &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ ert island .
see this whe@@ el &apos;s head@@ ing here ?
so i &apos;ll just give you my message up front : try not to go ex@@ tin@@ ct .
we have now data of about 15 years , to see how that forest is contribu@@ ting to the carbon redu@@ ctions .
four hundred and fif@@ ty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
this is the new york city farm col@@ ony , which was a poor@@ house in stat@@ en island from the 18@@ 90s to the 193@@ 0s .
two quot@@ ations to more or less end with .
he ble@@ w himself up , killing six .
so here &apos;s to another day at the office .
the only thing i had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stu@@ ff@@ ed for the collection .
and one of the other things that happened in the three gor@@ ges -- a lot of the agri@@ cultural land that you see there on the left was also lost ; some of the most fer@@ tile agri@@ cultural land was lost in that .
very pleas@@ ed to welcome you back .
and one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mu@@ tual curiosity .
and so from a brand@@ ing perspective , they got a lot right .
there are lots of things that appear .
what you also notice is that in any case our perception is le@@ ak@@ y .
if we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company can do it , anybody can .
robots are the most human of our machines .
i store them as words , and later on re@@ trie@@ ve them as numbers .
the immer@@ sive u@@ gl@@ iness of our everyday environments in america is ent@@ rop@@ y made visible .
so every five minutes , i took a photograph .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
and then after@@ ward , i said , &quot; sir , i want to give you the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table in case you &apos;re ever in a b@@ ind and need to calcu@@ late molecu@@ lar weight . &quot;
and she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portra@@ yed to work against those images in the media .
i have one gram , five gram , 10 gram . how many gram do you want ? &quot;
we have interviews , we have sur@@ ve@@ ys .
they can &apos;t fish there for a radius of 200 miles .
it &apos;s around 19@@ 00 .
in poli@@ tics also , there are different opini@@ ons .
this actually is r@@ ough@@ ly , in man@@ -@@ years of work , 200@@ ,000 dollars r@@ ough@@ ly , if you keep them on the low sal@@ ari@@ es with no benefits .
but perhaps if they &apos;d been able to read their fe@@ ars more like a scientist , with more cool@@ ness of judg@@ ment , they would have listen@@ ed instead to the less violent but the more likely tale , the story of starvation , and headed for ta@@ hit@@ i , just as mel@@ ville &apos;s sa@@ d comm@@ ent@@ ary sugge@@ sts .
and all of these are the same principles that apply to the sa@@ dd@@ le-@@ shaped spring in stom@@ at@@ op@@ ods .
when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start reali@@ zing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
then the front moves into the nor@@ the@@ ast mon@@ soon .
the first thing they do is they de@@ cor@@ ated the c@@ ei@@ ling .
winter is like magic . it &apos;s a time of change , when warm@@ th turns to cold , water turns to s@@ now , and then it all dis@@ appe@@ ars .
this is an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te from his tra@@ vels in south america .
india is a good place to do such an experiment in , because we have all the ethnic diversi@@ ties , all the -- you know , the genetic diversity , all the ra@@ cial diversi@@ ties , and also all the soci@@ o-@@ economic diversi@@ ties .
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of &quot; art is &quot; and trying to determine what art was .
chris anderson asked me if i could put the last 25 years of anti-@@ poverty campaig@@ ning into 10 minutes for ted .
my swe@@ et angel@@ s , come back . &quot;
so i want to show you a clip of algorith@@ ms developed by frank s@@ hen and professor na@@ than michael that shows this robot ent@@ ering a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
and this was very surprising to me , because i &apos;ve gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments i decided not to do -- and i never got this gu@@ il@@ t trip to this ex@@ tent .
they &apos;re dynamic .
the most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blin@@ ded by our own in@@ centi@@ ves .
which i &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t want .
and the be@@ ar is a cu@@ dd@@ ly , friendly animal .
t@@ wel@@ ve in their ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ a@@ sti@@ cal or cultural or tri@@ b@@ al at@@ ti@@ re aff@@ ir@@ ming one message .
we put names on the board , atta@@ ch them to gu@@ esses , and kids have bought in here .
abed could still turn his whe@@ el left so that i would see him wh@@ o@@ os@@ h by out my window and i would remain whole .
you &apos;re married to a guy and he pi@@ cks his nose ?
also on the web , when the text is too small , what you do is hold down the control key and hit plus , plus , plus .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hi@@ re a c@@ f@@ o . we put out a job descri@@ ption for a c@@ f@@ o at zero sal@@ ary , and we had a qu@@ eu@@ e of people .
the truth is , there are just simply not enough don@@ or organ@@ s to go around .
let &apos;s go back to high school physics here .
it gro@@ ws up into the ad@@ ult stage like that and then goes through a benjam@@ in button phase , and actually goes back@@ wards and back@@ wards until it &apos;s like a little em@@ br@@ yo again , and then actually gro@@ ws back up , and back down and back up -- sort of yo@@ -@@ yo -- and it never dies .
one kilo@@ gram of gras@@ sh@@ op@@ pers has the same amount of cal@@ ories as 10 hot dogs , or six big ma@@ cs .
an obvious question , and you &apos;ll have an answer now in your heads .
but now you will ; we put a bio@@ graphy of james wat@@ t in .
for you , that might be surprising .
you know what ? we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
people did not believe this .
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot didn &apos;t it ?
so i found a therap@@ ist .
and this was a hard shot to get -- i think this is the shot of the ant foot on the super@@ str@@ ings .
when nan@@ cy lu@@ bl@@ in started tex@@ ting teenagers to help with her social ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy organization , what she found was sho@@ cking -- they started tex@@ ting back about their own problems , from bu@@ ll@@ ying to depression to ab@@ use . so she &apos;s setting up a tex@@ t-@@ only crisis line , and the results might be even more important than she expected .
so here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the he@@ mo@@ zo@@ in and where the malaria par@@ as@@ ites are inside those red blood cells .
on that sch@@ ema@@ tic picture , a sort of ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se picture , we &apos;re hal@@ f@@ way .
and forward . yeah .
i thought that was it .
i think the beautiful mal@@ in &#91; ak@@ er@@ man &#93; put it perfectly .
we &apos;re all hi@@ v-@@ positive .
the whole thing about this , though , is that , you know , why am i showing it ?
and i ever met more hum@@ ble people .
but she &apos;d given the boys girls &apos; names , and the girls boys &apos; names .
now we had an interest in getting tissue sam@@ ples for genetics because we knew they were very valu@@ able .
don &apos;t you see it &apos;s un@@ accep@@ table what you &apos;re doing ?
let &apos;s look at this in greater detail .
and she was just the start .
it &apos;s about opening up . and this is true across the animal kingdom . it &apos;s not just limited to pri@@ mates .
the ar@@ row shows you the long axis of the skelet@@ on .
up until recently , that was the solar system -- four ear@@ th-@@ like planets with small radius , smaller than about two times the size of the earth -- and that was of course mer@@ cur@@ y , ven@@ us , mars , and of course the earth , and then the two big , giant planets .
why is it such a bad job ?
of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; where is your home ? &quot;
something always seems to stop us .
the service respon@@ ded effectively and effici@@ ently , during the unfortunate 26 / 11 mumbai terror attac@@ ks .
and because i had 70 percent of my body bur@@ ned , it would take about an hour .
i met ag@@ nes three years ago in the ri@@ ft valley .
so if you put these physi@@ ological process@@ es to work , i &apos;d hypo@@ thesi@@ ze that it might be our increased in@@ take of re@@ fin@@ ed grains , sug@@ ars and star@@ ches that &apos;s driving this epide@@ mic of o@@ bes@@ ity and diabetes , but through insu@@ l@@ in resi@@ stance , you see , and not necessarily through just over@@ eating and under@@ -@@ exer@@ cis@@ ing .
what i love about this project is he solved a problem that hasn &apos;t , that doesn &apos;t exist yet , so -- we also think that we can democra@@ ti@@ ze access to bike lan@@ es .
okay , hands down .
and the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that g@@ au@@ dy .
and at some point i &apos;ll even pass around what the $ 100 laptop might be like .
the imp@@ li@@ cation of that is that the wa@@ ve function has to go to zero , it has to van@@ ish when the hel@@ ium atoms touch each other .
jo@@ ey .
and they all come and they for@@ ti@@ fy the house .
so they &apos;d take one str@@ ing and they &apos;d pull it over here and they couldn &apos;t reach the other str@@ ing .
in fact , i know this is his sister , and you can just see him saying , &quot; okay , we &apos;re doing this for the camera , and then afterwards you ste@@ al my c@@ and@@ y and you pun@@ ch me in the face . &quot;
you get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter , 7@@ ,000 tons .
in spi@@ te of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
and so , you know , don@@ n@@ ell and i are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play , but we don &apos;t have any of those ready .
the vessels looked better .
the first move is going to be what ?
well , she did that because she , at that time , had ac@@ qui@@ red a new arm .
why ?
now , i want to end by saying a little bit about what i think this means for cap@@ ital@@ ism .
when we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really , really good .
this is based on an f@@ . scot@@ t fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald short story .
millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brain@@ storms into action , into movement .
once again , they &apos;re useful members of society .
but anyway , i used this for a cover for the nine inch na@@ ils d@@ v@@ d , and i &apos;ve also now fi@@ x@@ ed the bom@@ b shel@@ ter with du@@ ct t@@ ape , and it &apos;s ready . i think i &apos;m ready . so .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
it ven@@ ds out little individual vi@@ als .
also ro@@ de on one . i ...
but the electri@@ fied vehi@@ cles don &apos;t need to bur@@ den the electricity grid .
so , pretty horri@@ fic .

these are com@@ mon@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts .
so when you look online at the way people aggre@@ gate , they don &apos;t aggre@@ gate around age , gender and income .
you can run on our women &apos;s track team here . &quot;
i pra@@ yed for them , and things started to change .
death : adam ?
well , i &apos;m not here today to lam@@ ent about the situation , or wr@@ ing my hands .
your seat , your sleep and your play on a big geo@@ des@@ ic island made of lea@@ ther .
but i think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements , they cannot cross a bar@@ rier that was created by a les@@ i@@ on on the spin@@ al cor@@ d .
huge differences can occu@@ r without drugs , without surgery .
you ever notice here in america , social equ@@ ity seems to pe@@ ak at about age 24 ?
now i want to take you into the cal@@ der@@ a .
and they value that connec@@ tivity .
and that &apos;s why bio@@ diversity data can be so valu@@ able .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
these models , like the le@@ ak@@ y bu@@ cket , work well in most situ@@ ations .
and it has real beauty and real explan@@ atory power .
her talk about the aqu@@ a@@ tic ape , and the link , of course , the link between dar@@ win@@ ism and the fact that we are all na@@ ked ben@@ e@@ ath this -- we &apos;re not hir@@ su@@ te and we can swim rather well .
the go@@ ds sent the storm . &quot;
this is in the mandar@@ a mountains , near the ni@@ geri@@ an bor@@ der in camer@@ o@@ on , mo@@ k@@ oule@@ k .
once i go through this tradition , i was going to become a wife .
because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand .
and indeed , we now know why .
first , i want to explain how and why cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine had such a profound influence on inn@@ er-@@ city gangs .
and he said , &quot; of course not .
i was very happy to hear that .
and then we had dance s@@ olo@@ s where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
we were hop@@ ing that it w@@ ass going to have a kind of evil , spi@@ der@@ y walk , but instead it created this pretty l@@ ame way of moving forward .
and our partners across africa are extremely enthusi@@ astic about this .
but you can aggre@@ gate this and you can discover things about treatments .
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
economic games . so what we do is we go into two areas .
my ob@@ s@@ ession with this book , and the reason i made this into a film , is because it at once was add@@ res@@ sing the question of being a female -- tradition@@ ally , histor@@ ically in iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change , freedom and democracy -- while the country of iran , equ@@ ally , as if another character , also strug@@ gl@@ ed for an idea of freedom and democracy and indepen@@ dence from the foreign interven@@ tions .
it does work in bul@@ g@@ aria , you guys . two reasons .
the patient or sp@@ ouse agre@@ es not to fi@@ le a law@@ suit if one of the known proce@@ dur@@ e fail@@ ures occur@@ s .
well , trying to stay out of trouble was a little un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
but at the same time , i questi@@ oned myself and my own integri@@ ty and purpose in stor@@ y@@ telling .
it ste@@ ms from the character of gra@@ vity .
and they deser@@ ve more than that . &quot;
so english man@@ ia is a turning point .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like ad@@ just the data and everything that goes with the data .
in biology , carbon takes center stage .
it &apos;s a group of pro@@ p cra@@ zi@@ es just like me called the repli@@ ca pro@@ ps for@@ um , and it &apos;s people who trade , make and travel in information about movie pro@@ ps .
if there are 15 oper@@ ations , you know that none of them work .
indeed , an outbreak would be multiple kat@@ rin@@ as at once .
te@@ dat@@ ten@@ de@@ es , hy@@ att@@ l@@ b . where do you think i &apos;m staying ?
so it kind of cool@@ ed my te@@ st-@@ driving for a little while .
1,@@ 000-@@ dollar anti@@ body in@@ je@@ ctions under the skin , by the way , and 20 of them .
after watching eight ted@@ talks , he wants to become leon@@ ardo da vin@@ c@@ i .
you know spi@@ der@@ we@@ bs ? sure , they are products of evolution .
but eventually they did come around .
the li@@ sts go on and on .
the taliban now run their own schools .
so here , if you look at this poster , it has all the tr@@ app@@ ings of western culture .
jar@@ re@@ th mer@@ z , a s@@ wis@@ s-@@ gh@@ ana@@ ian film@@ maker , came to ghana in 2008 to film the national elec@@ tions . what he saw there taught him new lessons about democracy -- and about himself .
so besi@@ des physi@@ cally coming out again into this idea that it &apos;s not just virtual , it &apos;s actually going out to things .
bit@@ tor@@ r@@ ent turns every down@@ lo@@ ader into an up@@ lo@@ ader , making the system more efficient the more it is used .
unfortunately the school system is gro@@ om@@ ing this world to say , &quot; hey , let &apos;s be a law@@ yer or let &apos;s be a doctor , &quot; and we &apos;re missing that opportunity because no one ever says , &quot; hey , be an entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r . &quot;
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
nobody gets up in the morning and thinks , &quot; wow ! i &apos;m going to go buy some three-@@ carb@@ on-@@ to-@@ 12@@ -@@ carbon molecules to put in my t@@ ank and drive happ@@ ily to work . &quot;
to s@@ val@@ b@@ ard , in fact .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy out@@ put for two percent of your body weight ?
there are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic core , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ ghtly .
i listen@@ ed to her words . i suppose they were true .
but what did dist@@ ur@@ b her was she got very per@@ si@@ stent images or hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations of faces and as with ros@@ al@@ ie , the faces were often de@@ formed , with very large te@@ eth or very large eyes .
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .
today many of these children are addi@@ cted to drugs like hero@@ in , and they are dest@@ it@@ ute , like these young men in the image .
in the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled .
i &apos;m now very pr@@ ou@@ d to be a part of inter@@ voice , the organi@@ za@@ tional body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor mari@@ us ro@@ mme and dr. sand@@ ra es@@ cher , which lo@@ c@@ ates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to in@@ sane cir@@ cum@@ stan@@ ces , not as an ab@@ err@@ ant symp@@ tom of schizophren@@ ia to be en@@ du@@ red , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be expl@@ ored .
i said , &quot; do i really want to meet a guy from dis@@ ney , who designed computers ? &quot;
and some other ones that are not used in the set of 20 , they will not appear at all in any type of concent@@ ration .
and then finally , turn it back to the real world .
and it &apos;s walked away down the micro@@ tu@@ bu@@ les .
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
this is the library of human imagination .
it &apos;s really only a successful escape .
i wanted to learn myth@@ ology . but there is no@@ where you can study .
they would anes@@ the@@ ti@@ ze people , con@@ vul@@ se them , but the real difficul@@ ty was that there was no way to paraly@@ ze mus@@ cles .
and ground zero , despite all its difficul@@ ties , it &apos;s moving forward .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
thank you very much .
i mean , this is a very per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve -- this is part of our dna .
and the most bio@@ fuel we might need , just three million bar@@ rel@@ s a day , can be made two-@@ thirds from waste without dis@@ plac@@ ing any cro@@ pl@@ and and without har@@ ming soil or climate .
how can we fit more people into cities without over@@ crow@@ ding ? k@@ ent lar@@ son shows off fol@@ ding cars , quick@@ -@@ change apart@@ ments and other innova@@ tions that could make the city of the future work a lot like a small village of the past .
this ne@@ ar@@ by city of b@@ ali@@ k@@ pap@@ an has a big problem with water ; it &apos;s 80 percent surro@@ unded by se@@ a@@ water , and we have now a lot of in@@ tru@@ sion there .

now i &apos;m going to show you cell@@ -@@ based re@@ generation .
net@@ fli@@ x was right -- the net@@ fli@@ x model could cap@@ itali@@ ze on the d@@ v@@ d in a way that the vide@@ o-@@ r@@ ent@@ al stor@@ es couldn &apos;t .
we &apos;re doing changing media .
mar@@ sh@@ a lo@@ pe@@ z was a woman i met in gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala .
we &apos;re not very good at food in general . itali@@ ans do great food , but it &apos;s not very port@@ able , generally .
so , ye@@ a , this is actually just the beginning .
but the question ar@@ ises : okay , so how much do uruguay , para@@ gu@@ ay , argent@@ ina and indeed the state of ma@@ to gros@@ so in brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of ama@@ zon@@ as , which produ@@ ces that rain@@ fall ?
now , sylvia brow@@ ne is the big oper@@ ator .
they &apos;re kind of like the super@@ hero@@ es of material science .
you can show a slo@@ gan , or a symbo@@ l , or a sign that stands for democracy .
this is what we base our decisions on in global health : little data , old data , no data .
even with all that — excell@@ ent treatment , wonderful family and friends , suppor@@ tive work environment — i did not make my illness public until rela@@ tively late in life , and that &apos;s because the sti@@ g@@ ma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn &apos;t feel safe with people kno@@ wing .
i feel so fortunate .
&quot; well , just for the fun of it . sorry for having fun without you , &quot; is what you should say . &quot; i &apos;ll just go ahead and do it anyway . &quot;

when i could not fall as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter cold or hunger pa@@ ins , i hop@@ ed that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
most other societies have had , right at their center , the wor@@ ship of something transc@@ end@@ ent : a god , a spirit , a natural force , the universe , whatever it is , something else that is being wor@@ shi@@ ped .
this is a virtual radius , not reality ; the black hole has no size .
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners .
was the mind ready ?
remember , the investi@@ g@@ ating off@@ ic@@ ers &apos; report said the ligh@@ ting was good .
in france , a bus company is su@@ ing people for forming a car@@ po@@ ol , right , because the fact that they have co@@ ordin@@ ated themselves to create cooperative value is de@@ pri@@ ving them of re@@ venue .
water &apos;s pump@@ ed from the lake and is fil@@ tered and shot as a fine m@@ ist through an ar@@ ray of high-@@ pressure fo@@ g no@@ zz@@ les , 3@@ 5,000 of them . and a weather station is on the structure .
the vacc@@ ine will probably be us@@ eless .
the next step is to learn the cap@@ ability to make yourself a scientist .
you might be a net@@ working god , building alli@@ an@@ ces , which you can also do in the game , or just curious , going around and wan@@ ting to explore as much as you possibly can .
because we had different models based on our different experiences .
without the political will to find common ground , the contin@@ ual fri@@ ction of tac@@ tic and counter@@ -@@ tac@@ tic only creates sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ on and hat@@ red and ven@@ ge@@ ance , and per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ates the cycle of violence .
you know , i &apos;ve been bu@@ z@@ zed in the water .
so , once you have mo@@ bility , now you &apos;re making a lot of eng@@ ines because you &apos;ve got lots of units , as op@@ posed to steam ships or big fac@@ tor@@ ies where you &apos;re not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benef@@ iting from mass production where all the other eng@@ ines didn &apos;t benefit .
but this wasn &apos;t really out of altru@@ ism . this was just out of interest in doing something cool .
starting with newsp@@ ap@@ ers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requi@@ rement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bi@@ fur@@ cation between produc@@ ers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization -- and passi@@ ve consum@@ ers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
the pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary tumor , as it gro@@ ws , often starts to comp@@ ress the visual ner@@ ves in your brain , with the result that people with ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y have either double vision or they are pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly ne@@ ar@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
every person , every it@@ em will have a something that will be very specific , and will link to a specific repres@@ entation of that idea or it@@ em .
fur@@ ther@@ more , those images for@@ ever re@@ moved the so@@ -@@ called moral high ground of the occu@@ p@@ ying forces .
and very quickly ca@@ j@@ al realized that neurons don &apos;t oper@@ ate alone , but rather make conne@@ ctions with others that form circu@@ its just like in a computer .
instead , there &apos;s some in@@ her@@ ent comp@@ on@@ ent of innovation or dis@@ ruption , and increas@@ ingly these problems are bu@@ ried in big data .
i hope you will join me in this magic car@@ pe@@ t ri@@ de , and touch children and be honest .
sw : or maybe si@@ ren@@ a hu@@ ang would like to learn some ari@@ as on her viol@@ in , and einstein can sing along with some oper@@ a ?
these go@@ li@@ ath be@@ et@@ les are wired in their wings .
i want to quote this guy -- the guy in rob@@ es , not the other guy -- the dalai lama , who said , &quot; if you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
i will craft my own dr@@ um .
crazy , crazy .
but if you get to play with all those kno@@ bs and di@@ als -- and of course , really the controll@@ er over there does it all on software -- you can make some terri@@ fic ri@@ bs .
and she says , &quot; oh , go ahead . t@@ ase me . &quot; and so he does .
and now , i have a daughter , named o@@ des@@ sa .
you see san francisco and los angel@@ es start to make their jour@@ ne@@ ys down to hawa@@ ii in the lower le@@ ft-@@ hand corner .
what caused it ?
thank you .
he &apos;s also our brother .
but as you can imagine , it &apos;s cat@@ ching everything else in its path as well .
most of the project was done in the last few years of the project .

when you have two of anything -- two eyes , two e@@ ars , two n@@ os@@ es , just two pro@@ tru@@ sions -- those all par@@ take of the form of two .
this past janu@@ ary , i travel@@ ed to a place called wa@@ is divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
you &apos;ve heard about it .
and for us , we begin with solving the problem in our own back@@ y@@ ard in kenya .
i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage .
they wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
so we give this kind of task to adol@@ esc@@ ents and adul@@ ts , and we also have a control condition where there &apos;s no director and instead we give people a rule .
it &apos;s countries like nigeria , which are worse off than if they &apos;d never had oil .
at inter@@ ax@@ on , in@@ tra@@ -@@ active technology is one of our really defin@@ ing mand@@ ates .
that was their perception .
do you figure where that is ? it was on a window .
this was an animal that basically kept the forest mix@@ ed with gr@@ ass@@ lands across the entire europe and asi@@ an contin@@ ent , from spa@@ in to korea .
this is from mc@@ g@@ ill and university of mich@@ ig@@ an . this is the r@@ he@@ x , making its first ou@@ ting in a dem@@ o .
so we went back to mit , we took out the in@@ str@@ on machine , and we figu@@ red out what sort of forces did you need in order to comp@@ ress a bri@@ qu@@ ette to the level that you actually are getting impro@@ ved per@@ for@@ man@@ ce out of it ?
and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hos@@ pit@@ als in america .
who are these charac@@ ters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
and sound can actually be felt in the water , because the ac@@ ou@@ stic im@@ pe@@ dance of tissue and water &apos;s about the same .
last year at data , this organization i helped set up , we launched a campaign to su@@ mm@@ on this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty .
but guess what happened . the moment you add ro@@ me without coffee , ro@@ me with coffee becomes more popular . and people choose it .
and it was very funny . i used four , five and six years old kids .
speci@@ fically , if you look on the ver@@ tical axis , that &apos;s stress . if you look at the max@@ imum stress value for each of these fi@@ bers , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of variation , and in fact dra@@ gl@@ ine , or major amp@@ ul@@ late sil@@ k , is the stron@@ gest of these fi@@ bers .
they had black@@ ber@@ ri@@ es .

some statistics say 85 percent or more of fund@@ ing for small businesses comes from friends and family .
what are qualities of a bul@@ g@@ arian work ?
i take it to therap@@ y .
this co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
the nervous system has plasti@@ city .
and no matter what country you live or work in , you &apos;ve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of , even in their most ordin@@ ar@@ iness .
i always live in the present -- i love the present .
let &apos;s forget about that guy , too .
i don &apos;t play spor@@ ts . i &apos;m really bad at spor@@ ts .
so what did i do ?
it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself .
and the ma@@ kers of this thing were really enthusi@@ astic .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;ve always been fascinated with how technology could actually res@@ h@@ ape and open up auth@@ or@@ it@@ arian societies like ours .
and that , wouldn &apos;t this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world ?
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- deta@@ ched from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite ti@@ ghtly .
that &apos;s an in@@ conveni@@ ence compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
environmental justice , for those of you who may not be familiar with the term , goes something like this : no community should be sa@@ dd@@ led with more environmental bur@@ den@@ s and less environmental benefits than any other .
and he hand@@ ed me a black@@ -@@ and-@@ white prin@@ ted out thesis on a poet named eth@@ eri@@ dge k@@ night and the oral nature of po@@ e@@ try , and from that point , reg@@ gie stopped becoming the best to me , because what eth@@ eri@@ dge k@@ night taught me was that i could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the mon@@ osy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les , the i@@ fs , ands , bu@@ ts , what@@ s , the gan@@ g@@ st@@ a in my s@@ lang could fall right on the e@@ ar , and from then on , i started chasing eth@@ eri@@ dge k@@ night .

and then , usually after two months , we start designing .
and , as with ja@@ z@@ z , the dan@@ c@@ ers liked certain se@@ ctions more than they did others .
and i &apos;m not an exper@@ t on sa@@ dom@@ as@@ o@@ ch@@ ism .
now it turned out to be bill g@@ ates &apos; dood@@ le .
and with the 99 , that is what we a@@ im to do .
so all of these wi@@ -@@ fi – enab@@ led robots actually learn from each other .
there &apos;s also the six emo@@ tions and that el@@ u@@ sive x-@@ factor .
i don &apos;t go along with all that , but it &apos;s interesting that he had a simple solution .
so what else can you do do not win an os@@ car for best ac@@ tr@@ ess .
self-@@ study , self-@@ explor@@ ation , self-@@ em@@ power@@ ment : these are the virtu@@ es of a great education .
hell@@ o , everyone . because this is my first time at ted , i &apos;ve decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
here is a p@@ est , de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing p@@ est , a spi@@ der mi@@ te , because it does a lot of web@@ bing like a spi@@ der .
we can send ema@@ ils that can only be read by the intended reci@@ pi@@ ent , not even the n@@ sa .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technolog@@ ist , a scientist , a physicist .
so , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; exc@@ use me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
he suff@@ ers from no neuro@@ de@@ fic@@ it .
we need networks that can find out what &apos;s going on .
because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that i knew -- well , i wasn &apos;t sent a lot of cards or flowers . i mean , if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been in@@ und@@ ated , but all i got was a couple phone call@@ s telling me to per@@ k up .
and in span@@ ish , &quot; z@@ an@@ f@@ on@@ a . &quot;
she &apos;s an active pres@@ ence in their lives , as well as mine , and is inst@@ ill@@ ing in them the same values that she taught me and my brother : things like compassion , and integri@@ ty , and con@@ fi@@ dence , and per@@ sever@@ ance -- all of that wr@@ apped up in an un@@ condi@@ tional love that only a grandmother can give .
a@@ ar@@ on ko@@ bl@@ in : visu@@ ali@@ zing ourselves ... with crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced data
they would walk around . they would play with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
political prison@@ ers aren &apos;t the only ones being tor@@ tured -- the vast majority of ju@@ di@@ cial tor@@ ture happens in ordinary cases , even in &apos; func@@ tioning &apos; legal systems . social activ@@ ist kar@@ en t@@ se shows how we can , and should , stand up and end the use of r@@ out@@ ine tor@@ ture .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
so , step two , i hold the device up , and then i si@@ ght its al@@ titu@@ de there so i can see it clearly now .
from the &apos; 3@@ 0s on , road systems exp@@ and@@ ed , tru@@ cks took the place of ra@@ il@@ ro@@ ads , fres@@ h food began to travel more .
so , the di@@ alo@@ gue with the local and the global , the audience as parti@@ cip@@ ant and player and pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de lux@@ e .
in 2008 , cy@@ cl@@ one nar@@ g@@ is de@@ va@@ st@@ ated my@@ an@@ mar .
now -- -- all of you have done this .
mar@@ co temp@@ est : what i &apos;d like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment .
the economist magazine recently wrote an article cover@@ ing one of the re@@ cent studies on happiness , and the ti@@ tle was &quot; the happy , the un@@ happy and the bul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans . &quot;
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
we must think again about god .
i grew up in mobile , al@@ ab@@ ama -- somebody &apos;s got to be from mobile , right ? -- and mobile si@@ ts at the con@@ flu@@ ence of five ri@@ vers , forming this beautiful del@@ ta .
it &apos;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
but then steve the i@@ .@@ t. guy didn &apos;t come back .
but where does this sound , com@@ mon@@ ly described as a click , come from ?
when i came home in 195@@ 5 from university at the time of mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , a lot of people came home at that time and started having argu@@ ments with their parents and grand@@ parents .
&quot; and now i know i am completely compe@@ tent . &quot;
now , two dozen men can te@@ ar down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
of course , there never seem to be any dan@@ c@@ ers around when you need them .
because glamour can be very tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian and dec@@ ep@@ tive .
blu@@ ef@@ in are warm@@ bloo@@ ded like us .
she had to translate it into english at her gram@@ mar school .
this image i &apos;ve decided to show having a reser@@ vation about it .
it &apos;s effectively the de@@ fau@@ lt page when you ask a website for something and it can &apos;t find it .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
they tend to be web thin@@ kers .
journal@@ ist anas are@@ me@@ ya@@ w anas has broken do@@ zens of stories of corruption and organized cri@@ me all over ghana -- without ever reve@@ aling his identi@@ ty . in this talk anas shows gr@@ is@@ ly footage from some of his investi@@ ga@@ tions and demonstr@@ ates the importance of fac@@ ing in@@ justice .
life happens .
you just look at the con@@ sequences and see if , over@@ all , it &apos;s for the good or for the worse .
we made a new recording of him playing in the s@@ hr@@ ine audi@@ tor@@ ium in september .
it &apos;s made of paper and paper , of course , wick@@ s flu@@ id , as you know , paper , cl@@ oth -- drop wine on the tab@@ le@@ cl@@ oth , and the wine wick@@ s all over everything .
three years and two children later , we raised this 5@@ 0,@@ 000-@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ foot l@@ ace net .
and these incredibly beautiful bor@@ e@@ al forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in can@@ adi@@ an history , the group of seven were very inspired by this landscape , and so the bor@@ e@@ al is not just a really key part of our natural her@@ it@@ age , but also an important part of our cultural her@@ it@@ age .
there &apos;s a very concer@@ ning tr@@ end that wh@@ il@@ st many people coming out of schools now are much more technolog@@ y-@@ sa@@ v@@ vy , they know how to use technology , fewer and fewer people are following the fee@@ der subjects to know how that technology works under the cover@@ s .
but a modern tour@@ ist going around the pal@@ ace of ver@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at louis xi@@ v &apos;s pictures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his dinner tonight too .
so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes .
and if i can get the camera -- okay , great -- you &apos;ll see , as i get sort of close ...
you may re@@ call a year ago when a fire@@ storm er@@ up@@ ted after the united states pre@@ ven@@ tive services task force re@@ vie@@ wed the world &apos;s mammo@@ graphy scre@@ ening liter@@ ature and issu@@ ed a gui@@ del@@ ine recom@@ men@@ ding against scre@@ ening mammo@@ grams in women in their 4@@ 0s .
but the m@@ bi image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly influence that patient &apos;s sur@@ gi@@ cal options .
if we can find a way of becoming positive in the present , then our brains work even more success@@ fully as we &apos;re able to work harder , faster and more intelli@@ g@@ ently .
and from the beginning of today &apos;s s@@ essi@@ ons you &apos;d think that they &apos;re going to see this as this horrible difficult , pain@@ ful period that we strug@@ gl@@ ed through .
but this does not follow any of the usual tr@@ ends .
we &apos;re really concerned with kids n@@ au@@ ght to five .
i &apos;m not weird . i &apos;ve read steven j@@ . &apos; s bio@@ graphy .
ah , bal@@ eful stars !
now this , for me , is a common situation .
there are two a@@ chil@@ les &apos; he@@ els of glob@@ alization .
if you add demo@@ cr@@ ats , you add republi@@ c@@ ans , you &apos;ve got the american people .
and now the end : everyone was enjo@@ ying the journey very much .
i tried to figure out -- maybe solar &apos;s become attra@@ ctive .
but we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ?
there &apos;s good times ; there &apos;s interesting times ; and there &apos;s some stress times too .
hi , my name is ro@@ z sa@@ v@@ age and i row across oceans .
so i didn &apos;t think much about it .
and you know , how on earth did i get to 17 and not know that ?
but basically i love being a woman .
so now we get to the exist@@ ential reality of the story , right ?
so to me , it is a privi@@ lege , and when i look in the mi@@ r@@ ror , the facts are that i really don &apos;t see myself .
so , by a show of hands -- we &apos;ll start with the eas@@ i@@ est one -- show of hands : how many people think it &apos;s the gray one ?
i think in absol@@ ute terms , last year we ear@@ ned about 20-@@ od@@ d million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent e@@ bit@@ a .
thank you very much .
so these guys were in a wor@@ ker &apos;s gang mix@@ ing up as@@ p@@ halt one morning on the side of the highway .
and yet , in all its mess@@ iness , in all its difficul@@ ties , i would not have liked somebody to say , &quot; this is the tab@@ ul@@ a ras@@ a , mi@@ ster architect -- do whatever you want . &quot;
so the obje@@ ction that you can &apos;t have an obje@@ ctive science of consciousness because it &apos;s subje@@ ctive and science is obje@@ ctive , that &apos;s a pu@@ n .
and we spend 3@@ 5,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prison@@ er in prison , and school distri@@ cts spend 500 dollars a year fee@@ ding a child .
oh , that is so cool .
and -- i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this , and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually ema@@ iled me -- and they said that they app@@ reci@@ ated the talk , and when they got back to their car , they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event -- it had been a few months .
my time is nearly up .
in the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agri@@ cultural waste , they might say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in bio@@ fu@@ els .
but even between those three categories , it &apos;s too wide a gulf .
keep up with derek .
we &apos;re about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of russia : 50-@@ foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?
a local official literally pro@@ str@@ ated himself in the street , in front of these prote@@ sters , in order to get them to go away .
i &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
but there is something else that we are all experi@@ en@@ cing in this room .
well , the world bank estim@@ ates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 1@@ 0@@ .@@ 3 -- to address mal@@ nutri@@ tion in those countries .
and if i wanted to paint on people , well , i was a little bit embar@@ rass@@ ed to bring people down into my studio and show them that i spent my days in a bas@@ ement putting paint on to@@ ast .
you can &apos;t create this with standard manufac@@ turing techniques even if you tried to do it man@@ ually .
throughout my career , i &apos;ve been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects , docum@@ enting their work and obser@@ ving how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit .
suddenly our taste is being respe@@ cted in a way that it hasn &apos;t been before .
if you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s , they take your app@@ en@@ di@@ x out , and you &apos;re cu@@ red .
and this is a ti@@ m@@ ely issue .
right , so , let the robot stand@@ -up com@@ e@@ dy begin .
this is at fort camp@@ b@@ ell in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
he was con@@ vi@@ cted . he was sent@@ enced to life im@@ prison@@ ment , and transpor@@ ted to fol@@ so@@ m prison .
i &apos;ve actually been waiting by the phone and in fact , in 2000 , i was ready to talk about e@@ bay , but no call .
so we did it anyway . right ? of course .
sam@@ u@@ el pier@@ pon@@ t lang@@ ley was different .
and i thought , &quot; oh , wow . i found it . this is great . &quot;
and this is a measure of how much well-@@ being we get for our planet@@ ary resource use .
so we went to talk to the mini@@ stry of justice , and we said to the mini@@ stry of justice , what &apos;s it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-@@ off@@ end ?
and so he took me through the initi@@ ation ritu@@ al for a bam@@ ana pri@@ est .
sustain@@ ability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
so 14@@ 4,000 are called le@@ ster , which means about .@@ 0@@ 5 percent is named le@@ ster .
and they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; is he serious ? &quot;
well , you either hau@@ l around a us@@ b c@@ able or you buy a card reader and hau@@ l that around .
but is this true ?
this is the grand c@@ af@@ e here in oxford .
now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with p@@ ills .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
in fact , temper@@ ate and tro@@ pical rain@@ forests each produce a vi@@ br@@ ant animal or@@ che@@ str@@ a , that inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous and organized expression of insects , rep@@ ti@@ les , amp@@ hibi@@ ans , birds and ma@@ mm@@ als .
why not le@@ verage the lear@@ n@@ ings that you &apos;ve been learning your entire life ?
this invention will reduce global energy consumption by allo@@ wing remote control and autom@@ ation of every out@@ let in every home and business .
in 198@@ 9 , a large astero@@ id passed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 miles away from earth .
we want it to read that we changed the world , and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things .
but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percent@@ age of flu trans@@ mission between people is from s@@ nee@@ zing and cou@@ gh@@ ing and what percent@@ age is on your hands .
well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
hey , hey , black@@ -@@ e@@ yed su@@ sie ! hey , hey , black@@ -@@ e@@ yed su@@ sie !
the problem was that we had to re-@@ t@@ ape that history a week later ; because if we did not , we could not afford enough tap@@ es to keep archi@@ ves of that history .
and he has been very happy .
geor@@ ge@@ tte mul@@ hei@@ r : the tragedy of or@@ phan@@ ages
maybe we are among the first generation that really under@@ stands this digital cur@@ ating of ourselves .
so , an astro@@ lab@@ e is rela@@ tively un@@ known in today &apos;s world .
thank you .
he ac@@ tively s@@ ought dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion .
now , these people making these pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tions to me were not bad people .
but psycho@@ graphi@@ cs really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
so many more people would have been affected .
a tan , we were both tan -- is this true ?
modern materials allow us to do modern things .
it &apos;s better with a fl@@ or@@ ist , right ?
they &apos;re latin american .
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these h@@ our@@ gl@@ ass@@ -@@ shaped por@@ es called aqu@@ ap@@ or@@ ins .
this person is not doing anything violent , but they just won &apos;t do what we want them to .
i &apos;ll show you one photo here , and it &apos;s a photo by eu@@ gene ri@@ char@@ ds of an iraq war ve@@ ter@@ an from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called war is personal .
these are a few of the comm@@ ents i recor@@ ded for use when cha@@ z and i appeared on the op@@ ra@@ h win@@ fre@@ y program .
try to get d@@ s@@ l inst@@ alled in your house .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
but that &apos;s what you discover , is you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty , and you get the most amazing hos@@ pit@@ ality , all associ@@ ated with ab@@ ra@@ ham .
now , i &apos;ve got an example here from can@@ ada .
you can look at it from on top , from the c@@ ei@@ ling .
take a look at these guys , they &apos;re growing in power , and by the way , this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis , and that &apos;s probably going to get ste@@ ep@@ er .
so it turns out that design for inspiration doesn &apos;t really -- i guess what i would say is , for us , for what i want to do , it &apos;s either too slow or it just doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s in@@ effective .
ch@@ im@@ bor@@ a@@ z@@ o !
70 percent of the agri@@ cultural land on earth , 30 percent of the earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly de@@ voted to rais@@ ing the animals we &apos;ll eat .
no@@ a : the girls are obviously smar@@ ter .
but this is another , this is the grand can@@ al , which was constru@@ cted in the first inst@@ ance in the fif@@ th century b@@ .@@ c .
once it &apos;s created , plastic never dies . while in 12@@ th grade mi@@ r@@ anda wan@@ g and je@@ an@@ ny ya@@ o went in search of a new bacteria to bio@@ de@@ grade plastic -- speci@@ fically by breaking down ph@@ thal@@ ates , a harm@@ ful plasti@@ ci@@ zer . they found an answer surpris@@ ingly close to home .
she worked with a statisti@@ cian named george kne@@ ale , and george was pretty much everything that ali@@ ce wasn &apos;t .
and as you think about this stuff and what the imp@@ li@@ cations of this are , we &apos;re going to start not just conver@@ ting ethan@@ ol from cor@@ n with very high subsi@@ dies . we &apos;re going to start thinking about biology ent@@ ering energy . it is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms .
so , when you eat less fat , you eat fewer cal@@ ories without having to eat less food .
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a han@@ go@@ ver . &quot;
a book designer gives form to content , but also man@@ ages a very care@@ ful balance between the two .
kb : are you ready ?
and eventually some c@@ row gets a bright idea that , &quot; hey , there &apos;s lots of co@@ ins lying around from the first stage , lying around on the ground , &quot; hop@@ s down , pi@@ cks it up , drop@@ s it in the s@@ lot .
the day i left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day bri@@ mming with hope and opti@@ mis@@ m .
we now are treating 3@@ 25 people a month , despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the aids patients are now treated at home .
and then you look at cities that evolved after the autom@@ o@@ bile , and it &apos;s not that kind of a pattern .
what do we do with dis@@ placed fellow earth@@ l@@ ings who no longer have a home on the planet ?
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
so that pain has gone out .
here i am in os@@ l@@ o in nor@@ way , getting a nice , fat check ; sing@@ ing in hong kong , trying to get people to raise money .
and if avi@@ an flu hits , or for any other reason the world deci@@ des that malaria is no longer as much of a pri@@ ority , everybody los@@ es .
what is this ?
particularly mars , but also europa , the small , ic@@ y moon around ju@@ pit@@ er .
a giant battery could .
it enab@@ led us to actually eat all kinds of things .
our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becomes extremely bright and vi@@ vid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about today .
for example , cell@@ ul@@ os@@ ic ethan@@ ol , to power the entire u.s. vehicle fle@@ et , this is how much land you would need .
you can &apos;t just say that now i &apos;d like to do a sustainable city in central asia , because that &apos;s not really how you get com@@ mis@@ sions .
genetic algorith@@ ms are great for certain things ; i suspe@@ ct i know what they &apos;re bad at , and i won &apos;t tell you .
this is the root of the cl@@ ash of civili@@ zations .
i think it is a way to ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fy and illu@@ strate things that we cannot con@@ vey in a less@@ on plan , things you cannot con@@ vey in a standard , things that you cannot even sometimes con@@ vey in a book of pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
you might find this strange , but in my family we have different acc@@ ents .
and it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very , very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were mar@@ g@@ in@@ al , things like working in teams , doing practical projects , and putting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the ed@@ ges .
so we embar@@ ked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty in@@ her@@ ent in molecu@@ lar and cell@@ ular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on .
so i was inspired by a friend .
they have anten@@ na@@ e that sense od@@ ors and detect wind dete@@ ction .
and then we did res@@ pir@@ atory syn@@ cy@@ ti@@ al virus .
and it just sounds like the most e@@ go@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal request you could make if you were going to pra@@ y .
well i don &apos;t have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but under@@ lying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
can we stand to have more relationships ? absolutely .
education : six , seven , eight percent of the economy and growing .
how many have ever failed to achieve something significant in your life ? say , &quot; a@@ y@@ e . &quot;
we want to bring jobs . i &apos;m just saying .
it was the first project fund@@ ed by ar@@ pa .
they &apos;ve just institu@@ ted dynamic pri@@ cing .
those events led to a domin@@ o effect that has yet to end .
and , for example , this -- if we go back here -- this has become surpris@@ ingly popular among comp@@ os@@ ers finding musi@@ cal forms by se@@ arch@@ ing the compu@@ tational universe .
you can build a dna ar@@ ray machine in your garage .
and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff -- it could have mel@@ ted . but it turns out the ex@@ iting temperature was 6@@ 50 degrees f , hot enough to melt lead .
c@@ l : and so she &apos;s phenomen@@ al .
it could change the way that we die , but more importantly , it could trans@@ form the way that we live .
so that &apos;s the way to proce@@ ed . re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing compared to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
our social lives in the future dep@@ end on that .
but the truth is that never happens .
and that ten@@ sion , that discovery , that push for something new -- and at the same time , that sense of obli@@ gation to the regar@@ ds of cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man@@ ship -- that &apos;s as strong in cars as it is in anything .
this is my version of glob@@ alization .
so there seems to be a strange dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ality at work , i think , in many areas of human problem solving , particularly those which invol@@ ve human psych@@ ology , which is : the tendency of the organization or the institution is to dep@@ lo@@ y as much force as possible , as much comp@@ ul@@ sion as possible , whereas actually , the tendency of the person is to be almost influ@@ enced in absol@@ ute re@@ verse propor@@ tion to the amount of force being applied .
part of the problem , i think , is that we imagine that the kor@@ an can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can cur@@ l up with it on a rain@@ y after@@ noon with a bowl of pop@@ cor@@ n within reach , as though god -- and the kor@@ an is entirely in the voice of god speaking to mu@@ ham@@ mad -- were just another author on the best@@ s@@ eller list .
it &apos;s an interesting question .
i s@@ lam@@ med on the bra@@ kes .
now if you think about the gut , the gut is -- if you could stre@@ tch it -- 40 meters long , the l@@ ength of a ten@@ nis cour@@ t .
why ? why are we looking up ? is it because it &apos;s hea@@ ven ?
i was re@@ min@@ ded of how fra@@ gi@@ le our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are .
if you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathemati@@ z@@ able , universal principles , all of these sc@@ al@@ ings and all of these constra@@ in@@ ts follow , including the descri@@ ption of the forest , the descri@@ ption of your cir@@ cul@@ atory system , the descri@@ ption within cells .
youtube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
so , this is how i began , about 15 years ago .
next , i do 5@@ 7 squ@@ ared , which is 3@@ ,@@ 249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to coo@@ kie , 249 , o@@ ops , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to coo@@ kie , 250 plus 7@@ 7 , is 3@@ 27 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 6@@ 83 squ@@ ared , that &apos;s 7@@ 00 times 6@@ 66 , plus 17 squ@@ ared is 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,@@ 4@@ 89 , re@@ v up if i need it , re@@ v up , take the 4@@ 66 , add that to fission , to get , oh ge@@ e -- 3@@ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 4@@ 89 .
edu@@ c@@ ating the poor is more than just a numbers game , says shu@@ kl@@ a b@@ ose . she tells the story of her gro@@ und@@ breaking par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma humanity foundation , which brings hope to india &apos;s slums by looking past the da@@ un@@ ting statistics and foc@@ using on treating each child as an individual .
