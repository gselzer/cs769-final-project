and the facade of the parking , we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated , so we needed to perforate it .
and again , in peterborough , we started off with a program , but we also collected data , and over the period of time , we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements , so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term : greater engagement from the prisoners , longer-term engagement as well .
the last one i &apos;ll show you is a psa test .
but there is another part that we must together rebuild , to build our societies , our modern family of societies , we are at a point where we cannot go back .
i thought , why don &apos;t i make her an interactive mother &apos;s day card using the scratch software that i &apos;d been developing with my research group at the mit media lab ?
it &apos;s super-real and it &apos;s happening around you .
but the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 26-episode animated series , which is done for global audiences : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the u.s. and turkey , we know .
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
wangari maathai goes to a village in kenya .
when i go to parties , it doesn &apos;t usually take very long for people to find out that i &apos;m a scientist and i study sex .
owl , yeah .
people often credit their ideas to individual &quot; eureka ! &quot; moments . but steven johnson shows how history tells a different story . his fascinating tour takes us from the &quot; liquid networks &quot; of london &apos;s coffee houses to charles darwin &apos;s long , slow hunch to today &apos;s high-velocity web .
and of course , who wouldn &apos;t like to take a ride on one of these .
not bad , except if you look at that cover , what &apos;s missing ?
sometimes you keep the time up , because the time gives you detail .
and because he &apos;s performing a behavior you &apos;ve trained him to do ?
we could talk about government data , enterprise data is really important , there &apos;s scientific data , there &apos;s personal data , there &apos;s weather data , there &apos;s data about events , there &apos;s data about talks , and there &apos;s news and there &apos;s all kinds of stuff .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
it &apos;s also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self-awareness .
anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence , just as a result of this .
and , you know , once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
hello voicemail , my old friend .
and then suddenly , i obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
eric dishman : take health care off the mainframe
thank you very much .
we took him out to the kennedy space center , up inside the nasa vehicle , into the back of the zero-g airplane .
the first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness .
so , on the top , we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean , and underneath we had all this technosphere , we called it , which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers , and all of that .
basically classified adverts with a search facility .
play increases productivity , not decreases .
now i have to admit , these are the worst studies my lab has ever run .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s interpretation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mozart metaphor , where , &quot; oh , mris show that play enhances your intelligence .
at that point , can the child go home ?
and the second is a design issue , and it &apos;s not directly relevant , but it &apos;s a nice statement .
so at the end of my first year at harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who i had said , &quot; look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; came into my office . i really didn &apos;t know her at all .
joe smith : how to use a paper towel
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
cheese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ?
dd : i know ford has new electric vehicles coming out .
and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel .
elder care , child care , already much bigger employers than cars .
now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done , what has been done , how the world has remained both in between stability and instability .
music is life .
now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get shot .
we were having negative per capita growth .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
it &apos;s starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods , things from which all of us can benefit ?
i just -- i don &apos;t want to offend anybody . you know .
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
thank you so much .
we were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
our worst fears might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening .
and by 0.2 of a second , it &apos;s equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything .
i think we will play another tune now .
between them there &apos;s a waxy finish which repels water .
so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection .
he built one plant after another .
this is the word side of my brain .
hubbard apparently started to reach , but besides that , i think it would be good next year .
so , now you don &apos;t know where the spike is , and i don &apos;t know where it is either , ok .
and while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited , what i do learn applies to my real life .
this is the rete . okay . do you see that ?
when these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at anymore .
so when you think about it , we &apos;re almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
you might think that it &apos;s quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
first of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
rb : so , when i turned 50 , somebody took me outside the boardroom and said , &quot; look richard , here &apos;s a -- let me draw on a diagram .
so it kind of flips things on its head a little bit .
we never had a war ; sweden was in peace all this time .
one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
this is a series of light boxes i made for a show in italy .
thank you . thank you .
and i found myself looking at the paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology &apos;s been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement .
what jim didn &apos;t know when he released that movie was that six months earlier nasa had funded a team i assembled to develop a prototype for the europa auv .
not just translate them , but interpret them .
and now we &apos;ve whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs , and then we can enter the narrative at that position .
and now you &apos;re riding along with the iss where it is right now .
this instrument pretty much saved my life .
you &apos;ll hear about talks like , can a video game make you cry ?
and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here .
this first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
anyone want to hazard a guess ?
and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain .
it is there within every human being .
all the things that we see today that are changing our lives , we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology .
things can scale up , and they have scaled up .
so to be clear , what i really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual , simultaneously .
it was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain .
as far as colleges go , there &apos;s about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
so -- someone &apos;s done that up .
it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company , especially a small eight-man shop like my company .
now the journal of the national medical association gave my memoir a full clinical review , which is very unusual .
how do you know ?
this is called colony collapse disorder , and it &apos;s bizarre . researchers around the globe still do not know what &apos;s causing it , but what we do know is that , with the declining numbers of bees , the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture .
and you might say , &quot; well , god designed the cow . &quot;
moreover , we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states .
this is east asia , and the light blue there is south asia .
i mean , if a bunch of experts come to me and say , &quot; we are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we &apos;ve done a study of you , searle , and we &apos;re convinced you are not conscious , you are a very cleverly constructed robot , &quot; i don &apos;t think , &quot; well , maybe these guys are right , you know ? &quot;
and there &apos;s a chimpanzee watching , an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations .
and the truth is i just don &apos;t have one .
come on .
could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country ?
so it &apos;s happened before , and it will happen in the future , but right now i can tell you that i am so , so proud to be able to call pac-man part of the moma collection .
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and he was like , &quot; my god , what kind of a life form is that ? &quot;
and what &apos;s alarming here is that our business operating system -- think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses , how we motivate people , how we apply our human resources -- it &apos;s built entirely around these extrinsic motivators , around carrots and sticks .
this is really a change , that you have this lag of more or less 30 , 40 years &apos; difference on the health .
and this is an acupuncture note -- or i.m. pei &apos;s . some small ones can make the city better .
what was very surprising to me was tom &apos;s critique , which was , &quot; ghemawat &apos;s data are narrow . &quot;
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
in spite of all this splendor , the beginning was extremely frustrating .
we make sure that we select our equipment properly .
should we be collecting all of that guy &apos;s data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he &apos;s up to no good ?
we probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; fantastic ! what a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could .
it &apos;s what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil . &quot;
&quot; moon is one with god .
he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there .
and imagine , just consider this idea , if you would : what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass ?
and i had no idea where i was going . i had no idea .
and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works .
this is a setup i put in a physics lab .
i say that &apos;s nonsense .
the idea dates from 1960 , when a young astronomer by the name of frank drake used this antenna in west virginia , pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on e.t .
did you feel anything , there ?
and that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
he was a philosopher ; he was a drum player ; he was a teacher par excellence .
and there &apos;s different text .
so that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
you could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
so i &apos;ve been working on this a little , also , with a couple of other guys .
it &apos;s similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the &apos; 30s .
we had the bursting of the tech bubble .
there it is , pumping water from 30 feet .
and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland .
that profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they &apos;re trying to solve .
each one was more beautiful than the other .
i go running across campus quick as i can . i duck into hayes hall .
to me , it &apos;s just shorthand for what we &apos;re talking about : that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing .
a sound came out of my mouth that i &apos;d never heard before : half groan , half scream , barely human and pure terror .
as a &quot; dyer , &quot; do you know how to bleach ink marks ?
please meet &quot; tomorrow &apos;s child . &quot;
potentially , this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it .
the second thing he said was that , &quot; if children have interest , then education happens . &quot;
and this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year .
today &apos;s performers , like rhodessa jones , work in women &apos;s prisons , helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration , while today &apos;s playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more .
and over the last decade , i traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you &apos;ll pay for the miles .
thank you for your attention .
so , they say the eyes are the windows of the soul -- turns out they &apos;re a window to a whole lot more stuff .
but now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
i wanted my old life back . i wanted my body back .
this was one of the groups .
this is some of the generations of his universe .
so i thought &quot; perhaps , if i made these ants some apartments , they &apos;ll move in . &quot;
and for the rest of your life , every time you hear classical music , you &apos;ll always be able to know if you hear those impulses .
and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations .
and this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils , why hasn &apos;t it happened in other animals or even humans ?
the fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
i mean , right now , if you &apos;ve got a short commute , you can drive , you can get back , you can charge it at home .
then i decided i had to get really smart , i would take this job in the west coast .
so if you put it in the front door , your design fails .
for example , when i had a cluster of all the beautiful talks , someone thought i was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
taking tests is stressful , but bubbling in a scantron does not stop bullets from bursting .
and what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say , &quot; you know , i think i would like to put cds across the wall there .
if you have damage there , like in alzheimer &apos;s , you can &apos;t remember things including where you parked your car .
this problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
so , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am i doing here ?
politics gets weaker when debt is high .
when i &apos;m sitting in a submersible though , i know that i &apos;m not unobtrusive at all -- i &apos;ve got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone .
isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
a lot of these things had a good effect .
these same valuation systems are redeployed when we &apos;re valuing interactions with other people .
and there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
so what we &apos;re trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chickenosaurus .
and this is called blind date . it &apos;s a &#91; unclear &#93; , so if you &apos;re too shy to be really at the date , you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you .
it lists every known mental disorder .
one time a guy had a hole in his pocket , and that was rather traumatizing for me .
that means 91 percent , even after the census , still remain to be discovered .
i am one of her teaching gestures .
he was ultimately exonerated , at the age of 78 , through dna evidence .
julie : &quot; lol thanks gmail is being slow right now &quot; now if you think about it , that &apos;s not funny .
there &apos;s an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones -- which dials the clinic , we go and pick up the mouse .
i was a total failure in school , not really headed to graduate high school .
this is 130-year-old technology , and this is a problem , because over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers .
i mean , even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about xenu , the evil intergalactic overlord .
the receiver will convert these little , subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal .
when jungian analyst inge missmahl visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair , trauma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychiatrists . missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psychosocial counseling , promoting both individual and , perhaps , national healing .
and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother , and to us , and the toys of her kids , who didn &apos;t like that very much , but -- -- that was the only time she cried .
this guy is a little more contemplative .
this substitute cost nine dollars a pound , whereas real heparin , the real ingredient , cost 900 dollars a pound .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
it appears that it may not always be that way .
see , he owned a chromium plating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting .
he said , &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
and what we know now is this has huge impact on economies , which i &apos;ll talk about later .
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
he jumps back and there , of course , is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .
it looks like all these americans are here and yes , one brit , and he &apos;s not going to do anything -- he thinks he &apos;s british actually , and he &apos;s actually nigerian , i just thought about that .
clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction , including with huge costs .
conversely , there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka .
she goes , &quot; no it gets worse , read this book . &quot;
but i didn &apos;t have to cut any of them really , because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14 .
so , we turned to the data again .
i was also an early writer , and when i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read , i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading : all my characters were white and blue-eyed , they played in the snow , they ate apples , how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
it &apos;s going to come gradually at first . it &apos;s going to pick up speed .
are we designing for the world that &apos;s coming , whether we &apos;re ready or not ?
they &apos;ve been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
we can have a good world .
apart from the awards it &apos;s won , it &apos;s portable and it &apos;s certified . it &apos;s registered , the mhra -- and the ce mark , for those who don &apos;t know , for europe , is the equivalent of the fda in the u.s .
he just had the rules , he had the norms , and he tried to use them .
your body is covered with fractals .
when i placed a marker on the google earth map , i had to go with the nearest city , which is about 400 miles away from where i live .
for me personally , the most critical lesson of all is this : local commitment to peace is all-important , but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence .
they both empower our promise and our peril .
we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected , and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere .
&apos;it &apos;s a simple life , but nobody is restricting you .
so they have to also discriminate between these products .
but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
very few answers . i &apos;m also wondering myself , what is simplicity ?
so , remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?
well , got that wrong , didn &apos;t we ?
and because people watch mythbusters and csi , i thought , well , let &apos;s put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin .
they were all wearing glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage .
didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
pinocchio is probably one of my best design products , my favorite one .
but these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
and i think it &apos;s a very interesting question -- what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ?
but it won &apos;t be easy , because they &apos;re not going to look like this .
so this building downtown , which may very well become the site of our future farmers &apos; market , is now the classroom .
this picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and i brought him over .
thank you .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
it sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money .
i mean , i &apos;ve heard about that .
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
now , since you guys are really great , maybe you can humor me and say this all together too .
we began , perhaps 5,000 years ago , with writing .
i talked there , what , two weeks ago , something like that .
one night on stage , i actually entered my vagina .
you can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted . here &apos;s how heavily : if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system , they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers .
and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us .
it &apos;s not like i can just check it in the lab .
and this , to me , is always what training is .
so , any image of the kind that you see on the left , be it a real image or a synthetic image , it &apos;s made up of little regions that you see in the middle column , regions of different colors , different luminances .
it was just a story .
i seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
and a was lost by an italian humanist in 1564 .
now reincarnation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the afterlife .
she &apos;s illiterate , so she can &apos;t read the french subtitles .
very dangerous , very impossible to do , and particularly on our stage , because there literally is no way to actually move this train , because it fits so snugly into our set .
my mother &apos;s mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
and look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men .
so there &apos;s a whole series of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities .
now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but i think for ted you are .
and it &apos;s julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off .
so dna comes in and hits this blue , doughnut-shaped structure and it &apos;s ripped apart into its two strands .
and that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
that &apos;s a way to do it .
the data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
but the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor bangladeshi .
but i think there &apos;s going to be huge impacts .
and i would propose it &apos;s not a fair metric .
girl : okay .
macarthur winner sendhil mullainathan uses the lens of behavioral economics to study a tricky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child deaths due to diarrhea , how to prevent diabetes-related blindness and how to implement solar-cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?
this is her half-sister .
and i am going to tell you the answer , but obviously after this short break .
the very moment i turned it on , i hated it .
it &apos;s actually everywhere .
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
see that again .
well , so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that &quot; discovery &quot; and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying , &quot; but that &apos;s simply a mandelbrot set very big . &quot;
it would be terrible .
it may integrate technology and economics , but it starts with what humans need , or might need .
in this intimate talk filmed at ted &apos;s offices , energy innovator amory lovins shows how to get the us off oil and coal by 2050 , $ 5 trillion cheaper , with no act of congress , led by business for profit . the key is integrating all four energy-using sectors — and four kinds of innovation .
notice people are applauding for us .
and we were happy with ourselves .
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought , well , maybe i could become a biochemist , but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .
and the &#91; horizontal &#93; axis is time .
well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure .
this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm .
looks good , like batman . ow !
i just asked my mother one day , &quot; why do all these women love me so much ? &quot;
because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in -- our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything -- are directly a result .
it is , &quot; he said , &quot; only a female molecule .
it &apos;s not about low cost .
is the information verifiable ? is it a hoax ? is it true ? is it what ?
and that &apos;s the scarf whistle , which is also associated with a visual symbol .
but more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in , which was a community in belgium , all holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who didn &apos;t die , and those who came back to life .
they were not people from outside .
making people laugh .
i blush whenever i show this .
so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting and tends to lead to another meeting .
over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
and these are the briquettes that we made .
the whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
penelope boston : there might just be life on mars
and perhaps most obviously , and perhaps most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we &apos;ve heard about kind of illustrate this -- it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity , of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine .
because , really , they want you to look at themselves , right ?
brass nails tacked into the ebony wood , your face has been carved five times .
what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes , the most extreme variation .
nm : i &apos;m not tuned . hold on .
and nobody really knows what epidemiology is .
that &apos;s an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently .
my only instruments are &#91; an &#93; altimeter and time .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
what i don &apos;t think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied .
the auto-gyro couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the helicopter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
intelligence appears all over the place , in all kinds of guises .
and we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of america .
well , that &apos;s one reason we had a conference here at usc a few years ago .
this is just simply asking , again , as if we had arrived for the first time , what is the relationship of the human project to time and space ?

here &apos;s a magazine called &quot; hydrate . &quot; it &apos;s 180 pages about water .
so i was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
i think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data .
i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about , ties that are not economic but personal in nature , measured not in money but in memories .
it &apos;s not clear .
so instead of just growing destruction , we want to grow the things that we might enjoy , and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese .
now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
your job is only to be human .
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
so we &apos;re flying over here to what looks like a black hole .
this was 300 bc .
claron mcfadden : singing the primal mystery
i went back and i started putting a team together , the best guys i could find with a passion to do this .
a few years ago , i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
and nick starr , the director of the national theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself .
she was the most determined advocate for women &apos;s rights i had ever heard .
there &apos;s this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura , and this visual aura , by the way -- and i &apos;ll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights , gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .
jabbar : dana , i can &apos;t do this without you .
and i know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .
and dr. kang &apos;s going to walk onstage right now , and we &apos;re actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today .
everyone knows , &quot; they say .
it &apos;s the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong .
as an eighth-century japanese poet said , &quot; my longing had no time when it ceases . &quot;
it also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
you should never let your wife read something like this .
using the internet , i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer , and what i had found shocked me .
in fact , what &apos;s now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
this is what makes it so amazing .
and the transformation continues .
and then you created earth about 4.5 billion years ago , and then you got life about four billion years ago , and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago , and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago .
but i worry because this money is so important .
this is the same village in cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
it &apos;s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now , and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy .
hundreds of thousands with thoughts , interdiction . &apos; &apos; elyn , do you feel like you &apos;re dangerous to yourself or others ?
when his grandmother &apos;s away , he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma &apos;s bed .
and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case .
i gave of my time and my money , i gave when solutions were on sale .
lurching a little , but it &apos;s building .
and so for me , one of the things that i thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the worldchanging.com website .
that &apos;s where things are going to head -- still very early days .
so right here i start with the visual , and i immediately ask the question : which section is the steepest ?
i &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
now my company , fark , deals with news , ostensibly , and as a result we were not in violation of this patent .
next to him is dan panosian , one of the character creators for the modern-day x-men .
it &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things .
and before you get too worried about it , here in the united states , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .
now i &apos;m a science reporter .
it &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
you look in his intestines . there are billions of bacteria .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
you have bits of a volcano . there &apos;s a little bit of a volcano there . you have tube worms .
the restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
it sees itself , such as it is , the it , as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost , there will be a political price to be paid , for allowing genocide , for not having an heroic imagination , for not being an upstander but for being , in fact , a bystander .
we wish we were better husbands , better wives , smarter , more powerful , taller , richer -- the list goes on .
i teared up and i said that &apos;s where i want to be .
i &apos;ll have to really rush through this . they &apos;re a set of experiments .
so typically , small mammals live fast , die young .
ph : the company that created this , aniboom , is an interesting example of where this is headed . traditional tv animation costs , say , between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute .
and everybody can do it .
in fact , the greatest wealth . if you think about these other asteroids , there &apos;s a class of the nickel iron , which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like 20 trillion dollars , if you can go out and grab one of these rocks .
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
but when you &apos;re in a hurry or stressed out , that triggers something called the inflammatory response , which is associated with everything from alzheimer &apos;s disease to cardiovascular disease .
thank you so much .
so , but i &apos;m thrilled to be joining all of you here .
they go to the clinics , because they want to cure their immediate symptoms , and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions , develop their resources , learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe .
media and advertising companies still use the same old demographics to understand audiences , but they &apos;re becoming increasingly harder to track online , says media researcher johanna blakley . as social media outgrows traditional media , and women users outnumber men , blakley explains what changes are in store for the future of media .
get writing .
a no-brainer .
tom shannon shows off his gravity-defying , otherworldly sculpture -- made of simple , earthly materials -- that floats and spins like planets on magnets and suspension wire . it &apos;s science-inspired art at its most heavenly .
unfortunately , it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform .
we thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers , and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin .
but , julie , you were so ready to start school , honey . you were so ready . &quot;
no one had asked this question in his community before .
my name is meher and this is my friend irim .
but the more we learn about aging , the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate .
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
back in the late 19th century , the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating .
do the same thing at work .
and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings , so the collagen is as well .
x equals y .
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the aftermath of the cuban revolution .
and if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
and my mother was irish catholic , and -- but she didn &apos;t take religion too seriously .
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s shaping us .
that &apos;s her competition .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
and i go on the podium .
thank you very much .
it frees us from the constraints of our imagination .
thank you .
we &apos;re looking at valles marineris , the largest canyon in the solar system , superimposed on a map of the united states , 3,000 miles across .
i wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , &quot; i &apos;m really getting into the internet lately .
a great success .
the rocket &apos;s position is shown by the trajectory that we &apos;re now looking at .
and indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
there &apos;s a cut made in the scalp ; it &apos;s opened ; the neurosurgeon has a template ; he marks it around , and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device .
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
we are very sensitive to the negative , but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
what we saw was a natural experiment .
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in china is women in the coastal part of the country , whereas in india , it &apos;s all men .
so we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to enact those legal protections .
okay . now i &apos;m going to change gears here .
but you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , she &apos;s good at some things -- but if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s dealing with people on the phone , she &apos;s talking to the kids , she &apos;s painting the ceiling , she &apos;s doing open-heart surgery over here .
i don &apos;t want to have a conversation about that today .
medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer , and the problem is , as we age , our organs tend to fail more , and so currently there are not enough organs to go around .
it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence .
the camera is always on .
best of all , when it gets to the customer , it &apos;s not trash .
i &apos;ll show you something -- a little more of a concrete example here , as this thing loads .
everyone there understood the project .
now , in america law is a professional degree : you get your university degree , then you go on to law school .
when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .
dna repair genes are more active in these animals .
&quot; ahh , listen to me mr. titchmarsh . &quot;
james stavridis : a navy admiral &apos;s thoughts on global security
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to end before time .
&quot; i feel in love with carolyn . &quot; &quot; i feel so naughty . &quot;
&quot; my air jordans cost a hundred with tax .
so what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon , please .
it was a paralyzed phantom arm .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
and i won &apos;t be able to say too much about it .
and equally important is the negative version -- &quot; don &apos;t do to others what you would not like them to do to you . &quot;
and i &apos;d like to ask the question , all of -- we need to think about this .
this is the ali-frazier of motivation . right ?
coca-cola , they &apos;ve worked a lot on water , but right now , they &apos;re entering into 17-year contracts with growers in turkey to sell juice into europe , and they &apos;re doing that because they want to have a product that &apos;s closer to the european market .
i &apos;m here today to offer you that new model .
and that &apos;s sort of the body channel of emotional empathy , which many animals have .
and so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
and the second thing is that an ant &apos;s ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting .
and that &apos;s where family planning , better child survival is needed .
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place . matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .
so my coauthors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
&quot; i think so . &quot;
and , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
accompanied by a squandering of the nation &apos;s material wealth that defied credulity .
every morning , there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters .
only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same ! &quot;
al vernacchio : sex needs a new metaphor . here &apos;s one ...
tapping into the findings of his latest book , nytimes columnist david brooks unpacks new insights into human nature from the cognitive sciences -- insights with massive implications for economics and politics as well as our own self-knowledge . in a talk full of humor , he shows how you can &apos;t hope to understand humans as separate individuals making choices based on their conscious awareness .
you &apos;re not going to get away from that .
probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize .
and it &apos;s a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can &apos;t stop that rampaging mob who &apos;s coming down the street .
which way is it going to go ? it &apos;s hard to see .
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
efficiency : this is data through illumination -- it &apos;s first of all an illumination device .
so instead , we decided to take the column , and we decided to build it as a layered model , made out of very many slices , thinly stacked over each other .
but today , against my better judgment , against the advice of my own wife , i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what &apos;s left of those legal skills .
but actually in mature ecosystems , you &apos;re just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships .
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
this is a solar-powered sea slug . it &apos;s a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy .
breast cancer , mortality is down to four percent .
and then up above there &apos;s a garden on this side of the living room , and one on the other side .
the only problem is it &apos;s plagiarized from a major french feminist journal , and when you go to the supposed course website , it points to a lingerie-selling website .
those are my hands . i get up at 4 a.m .
and sometimes you even watch satellite , cnn , from the united states .
now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves .
i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city , about what &apos;s really happening there .
in fact , it should perhaps make use of the concepts that i developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be . &quot;
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
i also noticed that as i started to do more and harder 30-day challenges , my self-confidence grew .
it &apos;s old school al qaeda .
thank you .
there is lots of showing off .
leeches . mammoth chunks . they even have their own slurpee machine : &quot; out of order . come back yesterday . &quot;
we had detergents that could wash your whites grayer .
how many individual channels in that mix am i listening to ?
i think now i never was pure .
but it &apos;s a technology so pervasive , so invisible , that we , for a long time , forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution .
because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business , help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough .
a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature .
they &apos;d looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they &apos;d found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
but this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
i got this email from him two years ago ; he said , &quot; i think i &apos;ve got an answer to some of your questions . &quot;
we didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
if i were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago , i would be as isolated as a hermit .
it &apos;s still dough . nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do , i think , but not too many .
this is city hall &apos;s green roof , next to cook county &apos;s &#91; portion of the &#93; roof , which is 77 degrees fahrenheit hotter at the surface .
so , when i went to look at those figures , i noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states , never to come back .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now .
and so he did .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
our thinking is backwards .
notice these other , smaller protuberances .
what does this mean ?
we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong .
and symbolically , the colors of the interior are green and yellow .
at first i didn &apos;t think migraine headaches were a big problem because i &apos;d never had a migraine headache , but then i spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life , and their lives are being totally ruined by it .
i found a couple in norway last year . we &apos;re seeing them on the ice .
you know , this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town .
what safety they had was very scant .
you know , just at the beginning of this year , at the turn of the new year , new york city mayor michael bloomberg made a new year &apos;s resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012 .
and i was saying , and i wrote , &quot; but we don &apos;t have the time , and we really don &apos;t have the immediate expertise at a technical level . &quot;
it took me several years , but with the help of an incredibly supportive family , i finally decided life was still worth living .
that &apos;s a very far-fetched idea , but i really believe that it may be possible .
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
now look again at this .
here &apos;s a study published by a team of researchers as an op-ed in the new york times .
thank you .
thank you very much .
a new replicator was let loose , and it could never be -- right from the start -- it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature , could just copy the useful , beautiful , true things , and not copy the other things .
i &apos;m not a doctor . i have no medical background whatsoever .
but then she was beheaded , so never mind her as a role model .
mark cutkosky at stanford university , one of my collaborators , is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing , where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot .
you need to air out your pussy-cat . &quot;
and in my third year , i started becoming confused because i was yemeni , but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college .
that was why i put it as a single point up there .
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
in fact , that is three months solid x-raying .
they put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion , and actually cures type 1 diabetes .
i &apos;ve just got to say it to you all : i found all of my family in my adult life . i spent all of my adult life finding them , and i &apos;ve now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else .
i said , &quot; she &apos;ll be happy . she &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot;
they understand , in that context , &quot; free . &quot; they understand &quot; free &quot; is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway , and came to a corner .
and as a teacher of medicine , as a student myself , i was so inspired by that story .
so for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and i couldn &apos;t possibly do .
and then we have the human-induced causes of climate change as well .
looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside .
as the child grows , it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .
this is one of the most beautiful things i know .
and it could join into the relationship with you .
i &apos;ll admit that there are times when it seems like &quot; mission : impossible , &quot; but we must believe that these kids are smart .
they remind us that we all have nerd power .
so , you know , i do what i can with the students .
but then i read in &quot; dear abby &quot; that that was rude .
because what i used to do , when i thought i was listening , was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could -- i knew what they were going to say , and so i stopped listening .
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called &quot; medicine ball caravan . &quot;
and again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
well , do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain , the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify , and the human heart ? talking about it in the non-scientific term , in terms of love and compassion . is there some disconnect ?
i think stephen covey had the right idea .
what we didn &apos;t anticipate was the many , many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
it &apos;s making silicon as important as aluminum , and we &apos;ll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging moore &apos;s law for more processing capability .
so i don &apos;t think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really .
this is a face-scanning sphere , with 156 white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions .
so , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
and what &apos;s happening here , this is where you &apos;ve actually elected to join that nike community . you &apos;ve bought into it .
he wrote about a car .
and scientists , amidst complexity , amidst fluctuation and uniqueness .
in the year 1919 , a virtually unknown german mathematician , named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold and , in some ways , a very bizarre idea .
it &apos;s almost , &quot; do your homework , &quot; -- some involvement .
that is , the informed brain seems to be deciding , &quot; we &apos;re probably not going to make a deal here . &quot;
and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us .
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth .
more than 80 percent of ivory coast &apos;s development went into the modern sector .
but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing .
now , the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are .
&quot; the guardian &quot; megan kamerick : i think you &apos;ll all agree that we &apos;d be better off if we all had the whole picture .
but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive -- it &apos;s as accurate as mri , it &apos;s far less complex to interpret , and it &apos;s a fraction of the cost .
we knew that , when monolinguals were tested in taipei and seattle on the mandarin sounds , they showed the same pattern .
anyways , contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as i did .
but the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and i am in between these two worlds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other .
and , you know , people would always ask james watson -- he &apos;s not always the most politically correct guy ...
only seven percent said that they wouldn &apos;t consider buying a skycar .
i am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
frank capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
and sometimes by doing this kind of research , you encounter such beautiful ideas of design .
so the idea is , all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself , including air and molecules , for sure .
so it &apos;s kind of nice , the sun and the moon getting together this way , even if one is eating the other .
stephen wolfram , thank you .
a public place so dismal that the winos don &apos;t even want to go there .
but if you come , you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar . &quot;
in my career i &apos;ve had two exposures to radiation , which is two too many , because it stays with you for life .
when improvisation , resourcefulness , imagination are key , artists , at long last , take their place at the table , when strategies of action are in the process of being designed .
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear now .
duct tape .
how many of you once in your -- you were a kid , you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?
if you change the grasp , it can adjust to that .
if you hear nothing else today , please hear this : there are not &quot; schizophrenics . &quot;
because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ?
this is your conference , and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now , in this transition period , about this guy who &apos;s going to be looking after it for you for a bit .
is it possible , all these years later , to say tolstoy was right ?
that &apos;s quite a lot .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
and so we &apos;ll lose a little time . big deal . it doesn &apos;t make any difference . &quot;
if you &apos;re in it , india , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
it seemed , at that time , to be a sea of eden , but now we know , and now we are facing paradise lost .
all that being good and no real credit for it .
so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself , or as arthur arberry called his version , &quot; an interpretation . &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; because i &apos;m here and it &apos;s cheap , and you know , i kind of like pittsburgh . &quot;
that &apos;s the police , getting rid of it all .
they didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
we were risk takers , of course .
and after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is , if you can preserve it in the right way , which we can do with bamboo peels .
i chose papercutting because paper is cheap , it &apos;s light , and you can use it in a lot of different ways .
this is a silicon wafer , and essentially that &apos;s just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff , sort of layered up .
and i think i can remind us that we do care .
it &apos;s not about overthrowing capitalism .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the outer world is limited , temporary , and often , illusory .
in less than 40 years , there will be 9 billion of us .
but also the other hand is good , if all the other guys have good hands too .
i want to conclude with a worry -- i have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .
so it was very exciting .
and so whenever you heard any note at all -- if i just play a random note -- -- you knew instantly what it was , and you &apos;d got the ability as well to find that note on the piano .
it &apos;s a new telescope .
i would send out my books . i would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors , but they would go unanswered .
so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity .
so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep , and sometimes this creature &apos;s called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes ... whatever you want -- you &apos;ve just got to say no .
and we &apos;re in the business of designing soundscapes .
this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization al qaeda .
you couldn &apos;t be here if you didn &apos;t know this , yet you ignore it .
you know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . and i would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
so how does it work ?
you wouldn &apos;t have any ...
and so i can generate a force feedback .
privacy is nonnegotiable .
it &apos;s cool for me .
and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws .
and yet , if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings , i wouldn &apos;t be doing my job -- because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen , that practicalities are seen to .
this is not about new technology , it &apos;s just rearranging our metal furniture .
and at that young age , 10 years old , benki became the paje of his community .
and so when we look at a map of skin color , and predicted skin color , as we know it today , what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator , and the lightest ones toward the poles .
darwin complained , &quot; but why should you be so aggressive ? &quot;
we &apos;re talking about books on hyper geometric partial differential equations .
and i realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless i chipped in a chip .

my world was seen as less .
the thermal tiles fall off .
some , as had abed , would forget the date .

the dalai lama was once in portugal , and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere .
and in my own practice , from product to approtec , it &apos;s really exciting that we &apos;re taking a more human-centered approach to design , that we &apos;re including behaviors and personalities in the things we do , and i think this is great .
limburg , be proud of your cheese , as it is now used in the fight against malaria .
and we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
up until now , our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms .

i got up at the american association of cancer research , one of the big cancer research meetings , with 20,000 people there , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ve made a mistake .
but look at this animal do it !
but after we disbursed the loans , i remember a trip in uganda where i found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back shell , and we &apos;re now in free-fall .
my ideal date , i said monetization and fluency in japanese .
jim went three miles went down , and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage .
we don &apos;t want to regress and lose that freedom .
we &apos;ll have spatial computing .
so this is what happens as that burn gets going .
now let &apos;s take a look at these miraculous receivers up close .
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
so i assigned her list after list , and one day i assigned the list &quot; 10 things i should have learned by now . &quot;

we got a text from dan saying that , now , the first blue colonies existed .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
so , i think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the u.s. , and maybe obama &apos;s ratings can go up again .
they organize their whole life around this .
two of us are doing it .
we can &apos;t see into the engine room .
it &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
and when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action , i think there &apos;s a lot of fluff , a lot of greenwash , a lot of misleading advertising , and i feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up .
&quot; baby girl , someday the world will be in trouble .
so when you put another mri in every corner , you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery .

this is the wordscape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
for some of this kind of technology , ground center is a combination of design , which is crucially important .
this is the system as it looks today , by the way .
tbp : well you &apos;re going to have to use something .
there were many other things to do .
and within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .

and i think we can do that in public life more generally .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
and even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
but i want to talk about this larger world , the world of the micro world .
you know , in primates , there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism , which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females .
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google .
and this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics , but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms , and i found some in history .
so it &apos;s really unexplained as to why we need to put it in .
and that &apos;s free out of that conference .
little picks on the legs , where she does her needlepoint , and leaves little loops .

monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers .
i shuffled when i walked . i was bowed over .
powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology , but it was not meant for education , it was meant for making boardroom presentations .
this is the great frontier .
and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active .
i hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academia .
well , in 1994 , when pete best was interviewed -- yes , he &apos;s still a drummer ; yes , he &apos;s a studio musician -- he had this to say : &quot; i &apos;m happier than i would have been with the beatles . &quot;
we raised money in spain , in italy , a lot in brazil .

biologist mohamed hijri brings to light a farming crisis no one is talking about : we are running out of phosphorus , an essential element that &apos;s a key component of dna and the basis of cellular communication . all roads of this crisis lead back to how we farm -- with chemical fertilizers chock-full of the element , which plants are not efficient at absorbing . one solution ? perhaps … a microscopic mushroom .
and here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; afghan star , &quot; how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
so i pulled out my little pda , and i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s look up my appointments for september 12th . &quot;
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
and let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books , and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m talking to you today about the age of design , and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture , is still posters , is still fast cars , what you see at moma today .

i said , &quot; i &apos;ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot;
and you don &apos;t have to agree when you sit down with the other side .
so , we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
now , i &apos;m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
i &apos;m very happy to be here in india .
which -- which he did , which he did .
it &apos;s starts really , really early .
what &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
in some it is hot .
because we &apos;re taking this data in 3d form , slicing it up before it gets past the machine , we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology -- or , in fact , are impossible to build in any other way .
but as you can see , all of that rain , almost of all it , has evaporated from the soil surface .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
fair enough .
we &apos;re understanding , in fact , that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions .

in our applications , we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply , because it &apos;s a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen .
so whereas in the adults , as i told you , this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts -- in children it &apos;s much less so , when they are age five to eight , the age range of the children i just showed you .
i doubt , on that day 50 years ago , they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .
i looked around .
i expect a lot from food .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .

i started to have infection everywhere .
barbara block : tagging tuna in the deep ocean
nothing &apos;s leaked out .
today , when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric , we &apos;re oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable middle eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself .
but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life .
it has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space .
so for the deep sea squid hunt , i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters , no motors , just a battery-powered camera , and the only illumination coming from red light that &apos;s invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue .
oh , wonderful .
it &apos;s great that we have initiatives to say , let &apos;s go create the education and educate people in the world , because that &apos;s a great force for peace .
you can change the fabric of an entire country .
ok , so that &apos;s what we did , but how are we going to do that ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s an amazing way , and i &apos;ll tell you , if you come home , and your spouse , or whoever it is , says , &quot; let &apos;s talk &quot; -- that , like , chills you to the very core .

i &apos;m going to do &quot; lush life . &quot; it &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
you only have to go to the black sea and a few other places -- some lakes -- and get down , and you &apos;ll find that the water itself turns purple .

what we need to do is inter-agency operations , which frankly condi rice was in charge of .
my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds .
the design process was really tough , almost like a struggle for survival , but gradually an idea evolved : this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city , sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a scandinavian version of the spanish steps in rome , but sort of public on the outside , as well as on the inside , with the library .
so , it was an accidental discovery .
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp .

if that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the u.k. , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first-class mail the next day .

250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .

that &apos;s why we grow homes . thanks very much .
society &apos;s problems can &apos;t be solved until they &apos;re identified .
they pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
if you all stay down he wins it automatically .
which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character , popular explanations for this kind of thing , are really significant .
and compared to the little pain that it &apos;s going to cause -- because it &apos;s going to be embarrassing when i &apos;m looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit -- that &apos;s overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
that &apos;s the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice .
the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food , but from the wind .
and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .

i used the software they told me to use .
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
and so six-year-old lauren there noticed that the first one took one , and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one , the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one , and then the next one .
and when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we &apos;re starting to see , what you find is , in fact , even more access suffused into spaces .
e : wheeeeeee ! &#91; splat &#93; sw : yeah .
of course , these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don &apos;t hear more about them .
the latest poster boy for this phenomenon is david karp .
but how ?
babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven , and then there &apos;s a systematic decline .
it has not been seen publicly .
and again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
it &apos;s a joint of tubes . you start by teaching angles -- an acute angle , a right angle , an obtuse angle , a straight angle .
it turns out that lady gaga has released a new single -- actually five or six new singles , as near as i can tell -- titled &quot; cala a boca , galvao . &quot;
this is a graph from a paper by uri gneezy and aldo rustichini , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called &quot; deterrence theory . &quot;
maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .
and then after that , there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract , like phosphates , that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them .

people really like to have sex .
and also i found out there &apos;s many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church -- all the building was totally destroyed .

so a ray of light could go down , be bent up into the observer &apos;s eye , and the observer sees a ray of light here .
so these are examples of this idea of open-source security .
where will we take it ?
this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions .
with that , i have to adapt to something new .
above , it &apos;s just kind of , i bought a gift for my mother .
maybe those reasons , or depending on where you are , cadavers may not be easily available .
i just did a seven-country solo tour .
that &apos;s why casual sex isn &apos;t so casual .
i spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing , how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people .
so we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated , which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo .
and it &apos;s then being ripped open .
this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now , but i hope they will in the future .

well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
google answers is something we started , which is really cool , which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there &apos;s a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you , and it &apos;s guaranteed and all that , and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself .
i went to parsons school of design and then i began my career as a designer .

and then , if they &apos;re able , they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world .
you know , getting kids used to different realities , i think , is so important . what dan dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to make a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
and this is very critical stuff .
i think we have it now . yeah , good , good .
we hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago , but basically , from 70,000 years on , things were getting really tough , getting very cold . the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets .
now , this pore can open and close .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t represent .

expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -- which have set curtain times , set venues , attendant inconveniences of travel , parking and the like -- simply cannot meet .
a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader .
but it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws , so it was really wide-ranging .
and actually it &apos;s amazing , because i got phone calls from many reporters asking , &quot; have you actually seen the planet going into a star ? &quot;
philosopher dan dennett makes a compelling argument that not only don &apos;t we understand our own consciousness , but that half the time our brains are actively fooling us .
if we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map , infrastructure , that cross the straight lines , the borders , i believe the middle east would be a far more peaceful region .
well , in the last 12 years it &apos;s become much more apparent that it is .
it &apos;s fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
because washington to eisenhower , that is what we find in the developing world .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
and last is that we &apos;re more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you &apos;re sitting next to someone .

today we &apos;re at about 44,000 dollars of total output per member of the population .
i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful , and i think the same thing about the medical progress .
milo : it was good skimming stones .
airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space .
and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to transit .
so here , i &apos;m using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song &quot; smells like teen spirit &quot; in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression , and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition .
the same for the modern semi-conductor industry .
we need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . that &apos;s the best way to do it .
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward . it &apos;s called chimera .
so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska .
that could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
and we have to make this day work .
and this is quite interesting .
and this particular species really captured the public &apos;s attention .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .

i &apos;m sure at the time he did that , i didn &apos;t -- it didn &apos;t -- well , somewhere , i guess in the hidden recesses of mind , it popped out years later .
a lot of this is driven by what &apos;s happening in technology .

i have looked at the best and i &apos;ve look at some of the worst .
it &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
actually , the first time we recorded more than one neuron -- a hundred brain cells simultaneously -- we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal , this is the first image we got , the first 10 seconds of this recording .
and when he looked at that equation , it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force .
the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we band-aided it here , onto a gurney , a hospital trolley , so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor , you could actually have a conversation with them .
but since then , much progress has been made , both in our lab and other labs around the world .
now , the question we had is , how general is a distributed foot ?
and my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions .
these matter particles all interact with the various force particles .
no schooling was possible for him , except a few weeks here , a few weeks there .
so good luck . we &apos;re all in this with you .

i said , &quot; you &apos;re thinking about this just way too early . &quot;
well , right now in the united states , 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution , and vehicles are about 25,000 of those .
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
in fact , she need not have hurried .

i &apos;ve traveled all the way from cleveland and essex in east new york , took the local 6 line up to the hookers of hunt &apos;s point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space , and the one-to-infinite amount of man , woman and child you can fit in there only so i can push them to the back of the wall with my experience .
so the united nations did just that , and they recently issued a report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative , and they even looked specifically at the diybio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
you can &apos;t raise money .
by companies asking for this , we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world &apos;s population can go online to learn , to create and to share .
dogs deserve better .
but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters , ruins .
we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children .

and that &apos;s a serious option .
other people started to believe in what we were doing , and actually offered us hangar space , donated hangar space to us . and then the georgetown airport authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed .
this trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system .
and then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
frank nelson cole did not stop there .
and that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
so we need a better product . and we need better information .
now i &apos;m not naive .

jeff han : i &apos;m a research scientist at nyu in new york .
that &apos;s a key trend , which is decentralization , moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly , a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption .
these are not religious issues -- they &apos;re human issues .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m a parent , i &apos;m a resident and i &apos;m a teacher .
i launched a project named six billion others .

take an arbitrary example , long beach , california , you can go and have a look at what recovery money they &apos;ve been spending on different things such as energy .
but first thing , when you see dots like this , you have to ask yourself : from where do the data come ?
i think we have a design problem .
so you &apos;ve got to watch your space for that .
my name is papusay .
i want to be able to do what china &apos;s doing .
and then it wires itself to the current collector .
this is like , if you &apos;re familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation .
&quot; what ? &quot; i said , &quot; stop . &quot;
rb : well , i like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a virgin company , they -- they are quality , richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?

every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; clean coal . &quot;
in fact , if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention , the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters , and we could mix and match them any way we want , there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like will off of the path that they &apos;re on .
it must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
it took almost two years just to register the land .

and finally , you understand what those choices are .
we worry about cocaine coming from the andean ridge north .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats .

i &apos;m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so i put children to sleep for a living .
it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy-in ; it lacked stakeholder traction .

while i was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , &quot; why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? &quot;
north americans , such as myself , you know , we &apos;re basically sort of wallowing , gluttonous hogs , and we &apos;re eating all sorts of stuff .
so &quot; really &quot; isn &apos;t a word that we should use with simple confidence .
every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it &apos;s at its best .
and then the students would come into our sound studios , they would make their own rap songs with their own beats .
how do we explain that diversity ?
anyway , we had a major cultural issue .

now the main bad guy , rughal , does not want these stones to update , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop updating .
there &apos;s a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things , and it happened to lots of birds that people loved .
and there i was crying away , and smash , bash on my rock .
and no one raised their hand .

i &apos;ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
you know , it &apos;s funded nasa &apos;s budget up until now .
we drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor .
in all these examples , there &apos;s one ideal form , because these are thought in terms of structure .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
and then people started to feel that there &apos;s something new happening .
what &apos;s the next page ? gosh , when i was your age , i could have never done that . &apos; you know what grannies do . &quot;

the bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar .

they inhabit the trees at all body sizes , and , of course , they inhabit the land .
if you went head-tail-head-tail-head , you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses .
i asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza -- and i asked them the questions you &apos;d like to ask them .
so you can see here on the vertical axis , i haven &apos;t shown it all the way down to zero , there are lots of other options , but here i &apos;m just showing you the prediction , so i &apos;ve narrowed the scale .
and it &apos;s what i call being design driven .
now , it &apos;s often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies , and then higher energies , and then higher energies , or short distances , and then shorter distances , and then still shorter distances , and so on , is like peeling the skin of an onion .
and in fact , there &apos;s a proposal on the table now for building number seven .
and yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable .

there is also lots of land in africa where new cities could be built .
we will extend the same system into other areas , like dialysis treatment .

and so it is in africa -- it &apos;s a lot of difference .
now , hopefully , those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that , and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure , and in fact , you know , i can now take a dog , carve it up and then reassemble it so it &apos;s a linear string that will fold from a sequence . and now i can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits .
and the hopeful response derives from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies .
we are less connected to it . we let other people worry about it .
remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
one man died after working a 36-hour shift .

scraps of men do not exist .
so we were onto something , and we &apos;re still onto something .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .

if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
that &apos;s what drives my interest in projects like the tv series &quot; keeping score &quot; with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music , and working with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education .

harvest bombs .
we don &apos;t transgress the climate boundary until the early &apos; 90s , actually , right after rio .

like i say , it &apos;s a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory . it &apos;s full of prototypes and objects .
it is insane what dance is right now .
i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it &apos;s going .
maybe it &apos;s because my native state of south carolina , which is not much smaller than present-day hungary , once imagined a future for itself as an independent country .

insects and animals have evolved some amazing skills -- but , as robert full notes , many animals are actually over-engineered . the trick is to copy only what &apos;s necessary . he shows how human engineers can learn from animals &apos; tricks .

that &apos;s cubed metal . this is armatures , electrical armatures , where they &apos;re getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them .
the thing about cancer -- when i got into this , i really knew nothing about it , but working with david agus , i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .

now i would argue , actually , if you look at the fact that on the highways today , you &apos;re only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average , according to the dot -- the skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour , up to 25,000 feet .

some of it &apos;s very high-tech , and some of it is extremely low-tech , such as the project that mkss is running in rajasthan , india , where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls , and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll , who &apos;s actually died , what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere , and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget .
it was painful at times , especially for those around me .
so now i &apos;m not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead i &apos;m establishing a rule , i &apos;m establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded .

so we &apos;re going to go out and swing around and look back at this .
it turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some , rather subtle ones -- that were working against the easter islanders , and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra , latitude , rainfall . perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central asia .
but that is not the case at all .
the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells , which are very densely interconnected .
and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn &apos;t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi , &quot; if you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot;
and they love to tell you , &quot; oh , it &apos;s about 10 percent , &quot; proudly .

they are posh , they &apos;re wealthy , they &apos;re less likely to have outdoor jobs , they &apos;re less likely to do manual labor , they have better social support , they &apos;re less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political and cultural reasons , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles .
it &apos;s not as complex as it looks . that &apos;s not the issue .
her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target .
well , if people see the world in such a way that life sucks , then their behavior will follow automatically from that .

bonnie bassler discovered that bacteria &quot; talk &quot; to each other , using a chemical language that lets them coordinate defense and mount attacks . the find has stunning implications for medicine , industry -- and our understanding of ourselves .
well , this has emotions if you like , because it signals the waiter that , &quot; hey , i &apos;m finished . see -- upright . &quot;
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state .

i took these to tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
my daughter came to england from kuwait .

now my wife tells me , and i &apos;m sure penelope can as well , that there &apos;s nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that i &apos;ll never experience , i can &apos;t really argue that -- but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five .
or has tasmania changed so much that that &apos;s no longer possible ?
shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously .
there could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren .
and wish three is : imax film . so i was told i should do one for myself , and i &apos;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .

when i was writing my first novel , &quot; the age of miracles , &quot; i spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the earth suddenly began to slow down .

bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche , as she calls it , by exploding it into something spectacular .
a pioneer in research on play , dr. stuart brown says humor , games , roughhousing , flirtation and fantasy are more than just fun . plenty of play in childhood makes for happy , smart adults -- and keeping it up can make us smarter at any age .

when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
thank you . thank you .
and sometimes it gets big enough to become official .
that &apos;s a picture of me .

the kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state .
with this drone setup , we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination , where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else , and perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables .
mathematicians began to create shapes that didn &apos;t exist .
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
raise your hand if you do . oh , wow .
and it was here that i met jane .
and i don &apos;t know if it works .
then we went on to the dreaded fractions . again , he got it .

my mind teems , jumbles of faces , voices , impressions , i live my life over , as though i were drowning .
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
but look , i said i wanted to do three things with you today .
and it &apos;s actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
it &apos;s what i strive for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
well , as best we can tell , there are about two to three million disks having been published -- so 78s , long-playing records and cds -- or at least that &apos;s the largest archives of published materials we &apos;ve been able to sort of point at .
elizabeth loftus : i &apos;m elizabeth loftus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?
if it &apos;s helping to unite the world , i think it &apos;s definitely the fish of the future .
human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30 , 40 years ago -- carlton coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-darwinian era -- for over a million years , since the time of homo erectus .
the bard said everything best , of course , and he &apos;s making my point here but he &apos;s making it hyperbolically : &quot; &apos; tis nothing good or bad / but thinking makes it so . &quot;

bill hicks -- and if you don &apos;t know his work , you should really google him -- hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground , where finally the other kid says to him , &quot; huh ? well my dad can beat up your dad , &quot; to which hicks replies , &quot; really ? how soon ? &quot;
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
and that &apos;s not going to hurt .
and it &apos;s quite clear that , in order to make minds , we need to construct neural maps .
again , i know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past , but from a biologist &apos;s point of view , this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too .
that isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
they &apos;re not really used to having cameras here at 8 o &apos;clock at night .
i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed .
so you do that lots and lots of times , and you average those numbers .
we are going to win because we don &apos;t play their dirty games .

i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
sw : yeah , he paid . he paid his life for this , and that is why he is great and we &apos;ll remember him .
and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation , using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world , but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory .
so we chose a small spot in the garden .
but the second thing that &apos;s not shown on here : the earth has never had any ice on it when we &apos;ve had 1,000 parts per million co2 .
fantastic ! it &apos;s a beauty !
and here &apos;s a male .
as it went off , i took off and safely got to the other side .
that &apos;s understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate .
consider for example transporting goods .
and i think we &apos;ve done a good job encouraging that .
well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
and they &apos;re the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit , depending on how good they are at running the business .
finally , the environmental argument is fascinating , because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago .
for me , it began as i was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
another artist comes , paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank .
okay , so frieda is my dead skeleton .
but by 1929 , cities around the country had put in underground water pipes .
and for the last video , i think this is simply the best title .
so , i met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .
who knows , maybe one day we &apos;ll even have our own james bond , right .
and it was also , of course , surreal .
perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game .
it became the only piano in the region , and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived , she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home . we purchased it .
so we thought , ok , this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring .
the second video clip that i imagined was getting back to heathrow airport , and i could see again , vividly , the camera flashbulbs going off , the paparazzi , the autograph hunters , the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal .
let &apos;s talk about you .
&quot; i think he &apos;s going to hijack the plane with some ice cream . &quot;
i was here about four years ago , talking about the relationship of design and happiness .
well , on my wedding day , i had a conversation again with my grandmother , and she said , &quot; all right , maybe i was wrong .
in fact , the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity .
my mom was in the audience .
some are already deserts ; others are being seriously degraded by the sand .
in fact , we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts .
we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character .
the importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the farc , the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement .
and in the netherlands , we are very unique in that -- that is why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .
maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
really .05 percent ?
but the truth is i was devastated .
wow .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
and on the day i met my father for the first time , i was rejected from the rhode island school of design , my one and only choice for college .
right . we &apos;re now able to do that kind of thing with groups .
so very efficient vehicles , buildings and factories save oil and coal , and also natural gas that can displace both of them .
for example , in israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .
and if you do that , you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine , by this piece of the brain .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations it &apos;s a nonprofit , a community biotech lab in brooklyn , new york , and the idea was people could come , they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open , friendly atmosphere .
you &apos;ve seen this painting by edvard munch , the scream . every moment was a scream .
and it turns out the further back you go in history , the little rougher it sounds .
not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .
the digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy , perpetually busy .
it elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy , because that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to shrink that gap .
so , stories have characters . stories have concepts .
so , the interface with cognitive science , since we need to come to that , and it was , i suppose , the subject of -- we have to deal in such a short time with brain plasticity . the brain was thought to be more or less fixed .
no one else will do ...
the good news is that we &apos;re actually born smiling .
so , let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way , besides some entertaining insights about human desire .
we know it takes a lot to make it happen , and we know the direction the world is going in .
it &apos;s as if he &apos;s oblivious to what &apos;s going on that day .
two things .
it has the power , potentially , to replace our fossil fuels , to revolutionize medicine , and to touch every aspect of our daily lives .
now , i &apos;m a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport , and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it .
and sometimes asking the real celebrity , mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person , which is highly embarrassing . .
the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them , like the u.s. submarine community , which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by suzuki .
when he was a little puppy , he puts his paws on your leg -- you know , isn &apos;t that nice ?
and i love canalettos , because canaletto has this fantastic detail , and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting .
someone &apos;s offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing .
ok , so these are lp records and they &apos;ve been replaced , right ?
the gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
there &apos;s carbon that &apos;s being bought with sugar , with coffee , with beef .
going back to , you know , osha and peta and the humane society : what if osha got it wrong ?
mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising .
and the thing is , you know , the decision makers , the folks in power , they &apos;re up in their bungalows and so on in delhi , in the city capitals . they are all supplied with plenty of water . it &apos;s cool .
but this is both hysterically funny -- but i think an important philosophical point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value .
ours is 79 percent , and we &apos;re hoping to get that higher .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games .
so newcastle gave me a call . i said , &quot; i &apos;ll do it from delhi . &quot;
i asked them what kind of building it was .
so it turned out there was a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .
for liberals , the scores are very low .
what can we do ? it &apos;s not so easy .
i saw forests and meadows .
there is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled , simulated and tested : the auditory cortex , regions of the visual cortex ; cerebellum , where we do our skill formation ; slices of the cerebral cortex , where we do our rational thinking .
and just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
and this is when it really gets interesting .
there were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes , and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common , and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago .
how do we steer a balloon ?
and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dramatic flourish , and out comes the universal solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . in this particular case , a camera phone .
and when i was teaching , i used to always ask the students , what &apos;s the definition of a good job ?
the poem is called &quot; no man is an island . &quot;
and yet despite this , hardly any of us have ever heard space .
that &apos;s not luminescence , that &apos;s reflected light from the gonads .
the theme of this morning &apos;s session is things we make .
so , i continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter .
but who is going to want to plug them in ?
this could be our best century ever because of the achievements , or it could be our worst .
it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil , oil might start coming out of one of them .
those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling , overwhelming , and we were constantly asked , &quot; when will you start ? how many schools will you start ?
the second robot i want to talk about is called impass .
and we wanted to use the water not only as a context , but as a primary building material .
remove it , the cart needs one donkey less .
and this change is getting more rapid .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
i study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , i &apos;m afraid .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
connect with people . become very active as citizens .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
if you think so , then you are not like the u.s. employers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that .
but is , in fact , about the art of delegation .
and i &apos;m just standing there , watching this scene with a complete disbelief , not knowing what to do .
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve taught graduate -- i &apos;ve had graduate students , i &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot;
mikko hypponen : how the nsa betrayed the world &apos;s trust -- time to act
and it takes an active parent center who is not only there , showing a presence every day , but who is part of our governance , making decisions for their kids , our kids .
somewhat like the curving of the universe .
but you know .
bode &apos;s law wasn &apos;t even his law . it was a guy named titus .
actually , could you roll the clip , please ?
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .
and then once i have that folded shape that we call the base , you can make the legs narrower , you can bend them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
there was some bomb shelter built , apparently in the &apos; 60s cuban missile crisis .
can you spot the vegetable ?
so there &apos;s a basic line for people . and also , it can be changed .
because their teachers say that after the session is over , the children continue to google further .
and what people are beginning to ask is : surely , just as we invest in r and d , two , three , four percent , of our gdp , of our economy , what if we put , let &apos;s say , one percent of public spending into social innovation , into elder care , new kinds of education , new ways of helping the disabled ?
there &apos;s no sensation .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
patents are very difficult to overturn .
some people , i would never relate , but they sound similar .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money ?
the active ingredient was dioxin , an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities , and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation .
i want you to be happy . &quot;
you &apos;re what we call a partial paraplegic , and you &apos;ll have all of the injuries that go along with that .
where does it go ? what &apos;s left ?
but the ends of all those balloon trips were , you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time , and on that particular occasion , the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped , and left me holding on for dear life .
now , to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement , i &apos;ve got to give you the basics of space 101 .
there &apos;s the old one , responsible for windows and office .
so , i do want to say , at the outset , that i think compassion &apos;s great .
what if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
and there was no off switch , so it wasn &apos;t very good .
so , the seti institute , with a little bit of help from me , and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people , is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek , california , so they can do this seti work .
before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the biggest , most revenue-earning sector in the economy : 70 percent of our revenues come from oil .
and of course , i was only interested in the math , so the whole time , he kept shaking his head going , &quot; you know , i didn &apos;t learn it this way . &quot;
i started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when i wrote &quot; smart mobs , &quot; and i found that when i finished the book , i kept thinking about it .
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who &apos;s on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
now , he tries e again . that chord doesn &apos;t work .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .

ak : so i have the elbow that goes up and down .

i &apos;m pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf , we &apos;re currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .
that &apos;s how small that is .
this is america . this is liberty .
that &apos;s not the point .
but when you change those behaviors , your brain gets more blood , you think more clearly , you have more energy , your heart gets more blood in ways i &apos;ve shown you .
and what do you know ? we made 21st century money , and that was groundbreaking . wow !

and they &apos;re now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top .
he actually understood something about a theme that we &apos;ve been discussing all week . it &apos;s the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications .
this is avelile -- she goes with me wherever i go .
but automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
and so was darwin .
i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa .
and then i became a mother and had a son , and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us .
so , i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish , and in collaborating with you , hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality .
i like this for a couple of reasons .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .

yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they &apos;re very good at this .
this one , a little sketchy going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
this is a mess , mess , mess , brownian loop .
and maybe they &apos;re even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don &apos;t know .
&quot; yeah , that &apos;s the goat goddess right ? the abacazanian ?
is it possible ? it has been made possible , by the way , for certain other different reasons .
but when there is something that i really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of , like marching band or umpiring , we always find a way to do it , and that just shows that progeria isn &apos;t in control of my life .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them .

and much like in the dvd , you can read it out optically .
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 , when i really got it started .
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .

it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa sponsored .

it is on the back of this that the whole of southern spain has developed into a services economy .
right ?
there &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
and in 1992 i participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
and if you want an example of perseverance , grit and strength in a beautiful , little package , it is her .
it was one of the best issues ever . and they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains . it was really quite impressive .
we already use about 50 percent of the earth &apos;s fresh water that &apos;s sustainable , and agriculture alone is 70 percent of that .
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue .
as an architect , it &apos;s really hard to set the agenda .
i close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal .
no .

and then they make a little tent for the baby .
well , i &apos;ve just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .
and the thing about solar power is that it doesn &apos;t have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it &apos;s installed , it &apos;s just there .
now there &apos;s a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs .
in that clinic , even today , there are two social workers for 24,000 pediatric patients , which is better than a lot of the clinics out there .
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and &quot; pretty , &quot; and &quot; emotions . &quot;

i must say , so fervent was my love of the old brooklyn dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball .
in our interconnected world , novel technology could empower just one fanatic , or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses , to trigger some kind on disaster .
and i was rotating it in 3d and saying , &quot; i understand now . &quot;
so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago , we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves .
access to credit must be a human right .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
but the pay-off is really enormous .
but these are not new to africa .
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustainability , about lower power consumption .
i don &apos;t really think of myself as a designer , i don &apos;t really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer .
well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
in fact , the chinese minister of finance said to me , when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
dg : two octopods at about two miles depth .

where deserts freeze and waters boil .

he didn &apos;t actually buy anything , just some data .
no legends , no fairytales .
he looked at the hut . we went inside .
you know , that &apos;s not good enough .
second , an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by western support for kosovo &apos;s independence .
and emeka and i have had these discussions .
they don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .
what caused it ?
there &apos;s still time to nudge them , if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them .
if we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure .
they started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the u.s .
so after the sinclair zx80 came along the very cleverly named sinclair zx81 .
and if we have it , you &apos;ll decide how many miles to drive , what mode of travel , where to live and work .

it reduces earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
but we can change how it was interpreted , because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the middle ages .
but i had another idea about this map .
dr. earl kern , who &apos;s a smallpox expert of the u.s. defense department , states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active .
and you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else .
so , eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position , way over here .
they &apos;re just living life , and they end up just acting like that .
they had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in . let &apos;s stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now , please .
and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ?
it &apos;s not for everybody .
and that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
and that &apos;s what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school .
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .

thank you .
now , the connection between biology and dna and life is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because , even back then , his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask : if the earth is just a planet , then what about planets around other stars ?
i could just go home now .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
in fact , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s even traded above six , except for a couple of little spikes .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end .
those are not fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you &apos;ll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them .
they pat one another on the back ; they swagger ; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context .
so , can we improve that ? well the idea is we take this device that i &apos;m wearing , and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure , randomly assigned , versus 600 patients who don &apos;t have active monitoring , and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions , and that &apos;s exciting . and we &apos;ll start that trial , and you &apos;ll hear more about how we &apos;re going to do that , but that &apos;s a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead .
if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters , we can go into this hidden hallway , and i &apos;ll quickly just show you the interface .
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .

the fact is , is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified , skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal , they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire .

i mean it &apos;s probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient &apos;s heart before you actually do surgery , and do that with high-quality resolution data .
the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient , but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic .
if you look down here , it &apos;s fine . if you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
just , i try to keep my mobility through new activities .
you &apos;ve also got to let me know that there are touchstones .
and the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment .
and if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called server.exe .
two hundred million people a year .
well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters .
sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
when i was 12 years old , i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .
that thing .
test pilot : until the vehicle flies , 75 percent of your risk is that first flight .
here &apos;s a picture i took in alaska , a few years ago , of orcas .
she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .
so let &apos;s get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .
one single thing that everybody was going to because it didn &apos;t have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , because , i mean , it sort of says it all , doesn &apos;t it ?
she said , &quot; that &apos;s not me . &quot;
and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web .
why ? because they somehow assume that the internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets , while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography .
i don &apos;t know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event .
bf : you know , over the years , every year at the conference , it &apos;s kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with richard . and we &apos;ve always done something with the bullwhips in our act . it &apos;s funny , for years i did it with daniel holding balloons .
and it &apos;s going to do so for two reasons .
when we look at the universities , 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now , which is a significant shift .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small hill . i couldn &apos;t climb a flight of stairs .
you can &apos;t possibly read that . it &apos;s not intended that you read it , but that &apos;s a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment .
five out of six of us live in the developing world .
what galois realized : it isn &apos;t just the individual symmetries , but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object .
and so we needed hundreds of people to buy this .
for example , if you have read — i suspect many of you have done so — read the book by thomas friedman called &quot; the world is flat , &quot; he said , basically , in his book that , you know , this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes , it &apos;s based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented .
at that point , they usually give up .
now , why do i think now is the moment to make this argument ?
the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions .
but when it does happen , and these changes get transmitted down through the generations , they become markers of descent .
well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like michael semple , or those other people , who are telling the truth , who know the country , who &apos;ve spent 30 years on the ground -- and most importantly of all , the missing component of this -- afghans themselves , who understand what is going on .
but i think we can do both at the same time here .
so his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules .
all right , so let &apos;s watch this clip again .
and so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
and was silvia gaus right ?
but you know what ?
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
here are the robots that they inspire , the mecho-geckos from irobot .
and god shook his head and said , &quot; not this year , not this decade , perhaps not even in your lifetime . &quot;
the infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
it &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you &apos;re from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world , how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale , so that we can go from a world like this to a world that &apos;s more like this .
this fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
and i would just add we saw the same thing with sars .
i find these little vignettes , these little accidental pieces of design , to be refreshing .
because people like me took your job .
okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &apos;s expanding .
and it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars .
a lot of people feel that way about consciousness , i &apos;ve discovered .
these are very powerful technologies .
and maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective .
botanist corneille ewango talks about his work at the okapi faunal reserve in the congo basin -- and his heroic work protecting it from poachers , miners and raging civil wars .
and i was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
and if you take all animals together , we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families .
how interesting .
and so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map .
we know how to reduce hiv transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs .
and so basically , this has been the copenhagen consensus &apos; process .
where were they 15 years ago , and where are they now ?
my focus is understanding you people , and how you interact with the government to get your benefits , how you interact with corporations to decide whom you &apos;re going to do business with , and how you view brands .
that &apos;s the thing .
the metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff .
if this person doesn &apos;t follow directions , then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterward either , yes , we shot the right person , or , no , this was just an innocent person who didn &apos;t understand what was going on .
everything came back negative , over 100,000 dollars worth of tests .
it &apos;s a phenomenal thing . it &apos;s the equivalent of 2,500 tgv trains , and just think , they didn &apos;t have to lay a track or buy a car .
fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage , and i find this astounding .
okay . thank you .
and then all bets are off .
the next thing i &apos;d like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem isn &apos;t .
you see how he talks . you see how he lives .
here &apos;s another couple . he &apos;s projecting out at us , and she &apos;s clearly projecting , you know , love and admiration at him .
you &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
wofford college president ben dunlap tells the story of sandor teszler , a hungarian holocaust survivor who taught him about passionate living and lifelong learning .
vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school .
i mean , you &apos;re looking at the sales and marketing team .
one girl named mary said , &quot; you asked my mother ? &quot;
they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ; they had no need to touch her breasts .
so the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like , what our marriages look like , what our dating lives look like , and our new set of superheroes .
we just had our first pipa trust board meeting three weeks ago .
and then coming to this conference , i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change .
twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship .
and let me start by telling you , i gotcha .
we do ; they &apos;re the codified rules that i &apos;ve come up with , which are more-or-less ignored by the community .
it was a game of hunting questions like this .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
and in all that area , they &apos;re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
and i &apos;m choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you , to urge you , that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide , or you know somebody who has , talk about it ; get help .
we think it &apos;s a question of not whether , but a question of when .
if so , then how can we go about creating something that is truly new ?
i &apos;m hoping that i &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .
they have sex . they hide from predators .
when i was in high school i had created project v.o.i.c.e .
at every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
using simple , delightful illustrations , designer stefan sagmeister shares his latest thinking on happiness -- both the conscious and unconscious kind . his seven rules for life and design happiness can apply to everyone seeking more joy .
our hands are amazing instruments .
what about martin luther king ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .
in her talk , longtime english teacher patricia ryan asks a provocative question : is the world &apos;s focus on english preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages ? it &apos;s a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and several things are important .
it would have the informality of the town square .
when the son of the president of a desperately poor country starts buying mansions and sportscars on an official monthly salary of $ 7,000 , charmian gooch suggests , corruption is probably somewhere in the picture . in a blistering , eye-opening talk , she details how global corruption trackers follow the money -- to some surprisingly familiar faces .
maybe you have this child at home .
this is a fairly heavily litigated area , so we &apos;ve found that there are niches in the music world that aren &apos;t served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system .
it has taken me to juarez , mexico , where i was a week ago , where i have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to coca-cola bottles .
the second is for continued population , human population expansion .
and 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .
or do you let them go and have hip replacement ? &quot;
you &apos;ve probably heard all this before , but let &apos;s just go back over it .
and the map is actually a little bit bigger .
why ? because it is a quantum phenomenon . it &apos;s quantum physics .
basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
this is a turquoise lake .
okay , so now , here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
i &apos;ve split kenya in its provinces .
so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man &apos;s problem primarily -- which that was never true , but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and &apos; 60s , and it was in all the textbooks .
one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway , banking . i could see into the cockpit , troy battling the controls , and he just took one hand off , reached back , flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit , and it was the &quot; fasten seat belt &quot; sign you can see on the wall .
but the world of graphic design , for the most part , is not .
you see , the punishment was working .
and so she must have taken the ferry over .
at the 2008 eg conference , famed puzzle designer scott kim takes us inside the puzzle-maker &apos;s frame of mind . sampling his career &apos;s work , he introduces a few of the most popular types , and shares the fascinations that inspired some of his best .
you can see it &apos;s pretty much covered .
i &apos;m wearing a camera , just a simple webcam , a portable , battery-powered projection system with a little mirror .
but when i look towards the future , the next project is completely unknown and wide open .
it &apos;s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma , which is just alzheimer &apos;s disease of the eye .
and the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society .
that &apos;s , and i &apos;m going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning , not almost 1.5 million people a week , but almost 1.4 million people a week but i &apos;m a journalist , and we exaggerate , so almost 1.5 million people a week , close to 70 million people a year .
i come out of the advertising and design business .
but we need to go even further .
so here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for george bush , which for al gore ?
it was he who broke the mayan codex , enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script .
first of all , it &apos;s planted , and that takes energy .
and here &apos;s the summary of what i &apos;m saying .
so the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem .
basically , you don &apos;t have to necessarily buy brand new things . you have condemned computers that are stripped apart , and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration .
why we cannot be something is not important .
all consciousness is about communication .
head is ego , body id .
school &apos;s almost over . summer is near .
there &apos;s something called the human microbiome project that &apos;s going on in the united states , and metahit going on in europe , and a lot of other projects .
if we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities , as they do in europe , we shall become as corrupt as they are in europe and take to eating one another as they do there . &quot;
bl : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
so , it &apos;s quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .
he quotes one innovator who says , &quot; the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick . &quot;
freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
but that &apos;s one reason why they ended up where they were .
jh : i agree .
i give this talk sometimes with angela , who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation , with more than twice the votes of the person who didn &apos;t make it .
and that &apos;s named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius .
so we changed that and put , &quot; this is the famous budweiser house .
&quot; on the other hand , i don &apos;t have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador . &quot;
next , i do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 683 squared , that &apos;s 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if i need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
once again , the fat of the land goes to wasichu .
and you see things like this .
i don &apos;t know where to start , where to finish it .
and i was in the states at the time , and they called me . he was very sick , the first time he got sick .
and they did . stories of change poured in from all over india , from nagaland in the east , to jhunjhunu in the west , from sikkim in the north , to krishnagiri in the south .
but also don &apos;t forget , any unveiling is also veiling .
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of &quot; jurassic park . &quot;
it involved 17 different projects around the world .
but then you know , i press them like this .
as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda , the agricultural runoff from this crop , which goes into these buckets , is the sole source of drinking , cooking and bathing water for this village .
the center of the atlantic where the mixing is , i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish , because they manage their fisheries well , they &apos;re doing a good job .
thank you .
it &apos;s like a little disneyland for them . it &apos;s not like what we see .
i mean , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation .
you don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
four or five children sitting behind a desk , and even in those poorest conditions , they all have a very , very good grasp of climate change .
and i wish more americans would travel here . i always encourage my friends : travel , see the middle east , there &apos;s so much to see , so many good people .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically , you take an abstract term , and you search google for that term , and then you search the results that you get back for somebody &apos;s name .
this is really the tip of the iceberg .
now go ahead and cut .
we said , &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot;
his name is madhav chavan , and he created something called pratham .
what happens when the music stops ?
he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .
and that hospital could have afforded flashlights .
wool sticks on velcro .
we can learn from what they &apos;ve learned .
and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .
and the chip -- i &apos;m going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at kareem zaghloul , who &apos;s the student who designed this chip .
thank you , and god bless you .
well , guess what . it does .
big brother : we are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause .
i thought i &apos;d start with telling you or showing you the people who started &#91; jet propulsion lab &#93; .
i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . &quot;
the other amazing thing is , when this ballistics gelatin comes down , it falls back down as a nice block .
so here i had this falcon , and it was lovely . it looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world .
the cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .
so even my stethoscope is now digital .
and they basically said , &quot; look guys . we &apos;d like you to become netizen investigators . &quot;
there are also financial reforms in rural china .
at tedxcambridge , michael norton shares fascinating research on how money can , indeed buy happiness -- when you don &apos;t spend it on yourself . listen for surprising data on the many ways pro-social spending can benefit you , your work , and other people . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology .
power of shape : here &apos;s a whale . we &apos;ve seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them . and those little bumps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
notice a couple of these shots from the police department .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse .
four or five opportunities to see the breast masses , touch the breast mass , intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her .
am : i said to the receptionist -- i mean , i am just harried , and sheryl &apos;s at my side -- i said , &quot; look , do you have anybody here who could help me ?
it is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share .
so what i &apos;m first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building .
that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the 1990s .
so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
so think of it as a radio shack for biology .
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .
thank you ted . thank you .
who was i ?
do you want milo to squash it ?
now , this explains the right-wing nonprofit creative commons .
compare that to the airbag debate -- probably about 30 years behind .
that &apos;s what you might think .
we might not ever know .
that health that you &apos;re working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure .
and in parting i said , &quot; is there anything i should do ? &quot;
none in china . there are now 250,000 registered with the government , probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons .
yeah , i &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
anyway , i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .
and the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries .
but when you actually visualize it , all the connections that we &apos;re doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- it doesn &apos;t look technological .
because , dude , you know , four years . &quot;
it could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
people assumed -- and this was actually a problem -- people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs , if they had juvenile dinosaurs , they &apos;d be easy to identify .
it was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection .
so how do you feel about that -- the whole -- m well , it &apos;s pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .
and we make cells dance .
what is it called ?
and dr. terry erwin , in 1983 , called the canopy , &quot; the last biotic frontier . &quot;
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
but it wasn &apos;t that simple . because by the time i got out of that unit , i was not functional at all .
and fire was used to clear out , and again , affected the ecology of grass and whole continents , and was used in cooking .
and suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole resistance had a huge problem : even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink , called &quot; indelible , &quot; the &quot; waterman &quot; blue ink .
for every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
we have no water whatsoever .
it was the cheapest source of protein in america .
i also want to tell you and share with you how my team and i have been using mushrooms over the last three years .
the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades .
they put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way , but i don &apos;t care -- and they had them watch a horror movie , and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .
now this situation , already i -- you know , i don &apos;t really like thinking about this , although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it . so the point is that we &apos;re very , very insecure in terms of developing this material .
the wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous .
but i should really talk stage five , right ? &quot; life is great . &quot;
but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
so i &apos;ve gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
well , it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple , logical reason , namely , it &apos;s a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we &apos;re conscious .
so , this is , again , my daughter &apos;s dress .
it wasn &apos;t two years ago that everybody was talking about -- we &apos;ve found the holy grail of biology .
over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the united states .
so when i asked him , he told me three things .
you could have friendship relationships , sibling relationships , spousal relationships , co-worker relationships , neighbor relationships and the like .
and then we had the electric washing machine .
we could make a very long list , but obviously nelson mandela , emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor , 23 years of imprisonment , with this amazing ability to forgive , so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath .
so he basically set up , or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief , because what he photographed was the real thing , a mir sub going down , or actually two mir subs going down to the real wreck , and he created this very haunting footage .
and mr. berlusconi knows it , as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth .
human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- is that person dangerous ? are they attractive ?
so are these now the images of the past ?
if you are happy about something , you &apos;ll go more to the left side .
today &apos;s its debut .
we &apos;ve been asking it here at ted already .
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
george bernard shaw said it a little differently .
how did that feel when they came and whisked you away , and your lifestyle completely changed ?
in cincinnati , for instance , that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an abrahamic meal together .
we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way .
but the researchers had a problem .
you can make your own purpose .
and what we tried was this ; here is a device called the cadwell model mes10 .
but even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities , quantities that have no analog in biology , that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago .
we also presented to nike even .
i really love cheese sandwiches . &quot;
yeah . and as i drive through a neighborhood , say , where people got-a-lotta , i &apos;ll take a mockingbird i caught in a neighborhood where folks ain &apos;t got nada and just let it go , you know .
how do you do that ? that &apos;s water upside down .
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
but when politics is only management of mistrust , then -- i &apos;m very glad that &quot; 1984 &quot; has been mentioned -- now we &apos;re going to have &quot; 1984 &quot; in reverse .
nothing says &quot; i love you &quot; like &quot; let me find somebody else i give a damn about . &quot;
and they come in and they go through the process , our process , they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently .
and we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that &apos;s made from petrochemicals .
for a week or more , i had barely eaten .
and europe , which is right now in the middle of the day , is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages .
what we do have is the u.s.-enabled leviathan force that says , &quot; you want me to take that guy down ? i &apos;ll take that guy down .
we &apos;re taking this data and building better models .
it lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional .
they tell us about our world in a lot of different ways , and particularly the ocean .
these countries &apos; borders originate from stalin &apos;s decrees .
there &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
their names are patrice and patee .
there &apos;s one called tor , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway .
i didn &apos;t go out and buy a bigger house .
they are the entrepreneurs .
that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
so as soon as i tried to get near the piano , i was firmly shoved off .
let &apos;s go to the video , and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries .
on this side -- remember , you &apos;re excited about head-tail-tail ; you &apos;re excited about head-tail-head .
the question is , why ? why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little ?
we also call him an underdog because goliath is an experienced warrior , and david is just a shepherd .
we could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn .
look at the waves coming here to shore .
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product , the data that &apos;s changing on a weekly , if not a daily , basis ?
today , you &apos;ve got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are .
i didn &apos;t have a phone number to call to say i was coming .
you should turn it into mcdonald &apos;s .
i want to start with a game .
&#91; unclear &#93; , you said that yesterday . i &apos;m just repeating it because that &apos;s what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere , the emptiness .
i spoke some time ago to a joint session of congress , last year .
and this is the terrain it appears over , and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars .
ok , now . why does this thing smell of cut grass , ok ?
november 2005 : the streets are burning .
bed nets are very cheap .
that &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
see me now . don &apos;t talk about it later .
but that doesn &apos;t matter , because this is moving forward .
now , is this possible ? people would ask : how much would that cost ?
i was clean . there wasn &apos;t a bloody leak in the place , it was just fantastic .
so here &apos;s a shape . i actually spent about a year in my home , in my underwear , coding , like linus &#91; torvalds &#93; , in that picture before .

and i know it says mit , and this is caltech , but i have a couple extra if people want it .
if you think of the great buildings , of the cathedrals , of the temples , of the pyramids , of pagodas , of cities in india and beyond , you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea , but by people .
they get near shore . look at these two boats .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
and now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround .
so i don &apos;t want somebody who &apos;s saying , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got a great idea in a business i know nothing about .

the smartest one , first to come in , was the mtn company of south africa .
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting , partly as a function of temperature , partly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
the government , meanwhile , has been acting like santa claus .
the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
and in order to understand it , what we want to see is the way , in this new kind of language , there is new structure coming up .
i &apos;m just going to focus on a few of them , and let &apos;s start with fire , because i think fire is probably the first one that you &apos;re all thinking about right now .
from field studies to laboratory studies , we see that winning or losing an election , gaining or losing a romantic partner , getting or not getting a promotion , passing or not passing a college test , on and on , have far less impact , less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have .
they don &apos;t usually fade in and out .

there is no space there .
now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication .
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me . people who couldn &apos;t sit still .
no , i &apos;m just joking .
now , you need a laptop .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
i &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
because the problem is , when you have advanced cancer , we can &apos;t do that much today about it , as the statistics allude to .

our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
and the results were super dramatic .
there are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named .
and this is where you come in .
well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn &apos;t always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
they don &apos;t wear shoes . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot more problems like that -- aids , pneumonia -- i can just see you &apos;re getting excited , just at the very name of these things .
you can walk through . you can touch .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .

everything is reliant on these computers working .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .

it &apos;s also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the &quot; humongous fungus &quot; because it happens to be one of the world &apos;s largest organisms as well .

i had a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years , where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease . that &apos;s malaria . 6,000 people a day .
this is what gives us the hopeless image .
but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
i say to myself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
so once we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral-sized pieces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome .
and so , that &apos;s an amazing thing to consider .
we then went to the tv idea , that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece , if you could get on tv enough times , if you could buy enough ads , you could win .
but now , after generation 20 , it actually walks in a straight line without falling over .
put it back .
its characters are triangles , circles and other geometrical figures , without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ; without these , one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth . &quot;
read the license .
well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they &apos;re ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
who changed their opinion , and why ?
environmentally conscious businesses are doable .
he was building a machine to do mathematics , and lovelace said , &quot; you could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; and just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
and i said , never .
we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site .
and we &apos;re going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about , and between subpopulations of humans as well .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means .
then , after a few weeks , we set up camps .
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
this is the first flying machine . this was the first prototype .
it &apos;s a classic gamma retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
these are by a simple , standard test : in the case of the shower , does it have hot and cold water , two taps that work , a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body , and a drain that takes the water away ?
all right , so i want you to take a moment , and i want you to think of three things that you know to be true .
and kosovo became independent .
and what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way , is no longer there .
so this is what i was talking about , while molding , it &apos;s such a great experience , because we have freedom of like walking , or moving my hand or , moving around in the space , but the moment this becomes solid , when you cannot move even an inch , because this is plaster of paris , so the moment you pour it it &apos;s like liquid ; but after 20 minutes , it &apos;s almost like a hard stone .
on march 14 , this year , i posted this poster on facebook .
this was bert the turtle .
as a child so young and tender , words i can &apos;t forget i still remember .
some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket .
it &apos;s the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces , you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny , tiny , tiny little increments which they feel are their own .
and prego then went back , and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce , and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country .
so that &apos;s how i answer that question .
main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
but that &apos;s not the case .
okay , now getting to a part -- i want to show design in illusions . i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye . so that when you saw from one little angle was like this . and this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .
however , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice , and that this is how things should work .
and this has become part of our toolkit where the activities are in the data , and with it , trace the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could focus our transcription efforts , all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself , my wife , our nanny , and over time , the words he began to produce .
the bubbles are the countries .
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .
neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it &apos;s due , so he said , december , you &apos;re just going to see lots of angry negotiations , negotiations breaking apart , reports of phone calls that aren &apos;t going well , people saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and then sometime around christmas or new year &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; okay , they resolved everything . &quot;
but this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
do you remember the wrestler andré the giant ?
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
so bill gates , as he was staring out at the audience , he said , &quot; if you &apos;re not fully utilizing half the resources in your country , there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10 . &quot;

and it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach , and mount kilimanjaro and mount meru were kind of right across the chest , that were also fuzzy .
executive office of the president .
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
i think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way that we understand our physical limitations , even though they don &apos;t stare us in the face in the same way , we could design a better world .
but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not relatively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already committed 100,000 soldiers previously .
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response , she said , &quot; don &apos;t worry , same thing back home .
for this , we &apos;re showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the airpix .
and i go , &quot; oh , it &apos;s the same . it &apos;s basically the same . &quot;
now , that was my first puzzle . i got hooked .
oh -- the other thing that i think i &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . right over here .
all she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn &apos;t even understand .
here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
now , see , that &apos;s because coke bottles are solid .
and it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
and you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way .
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
sasha vucinic : it &apos;s a great clip , isn &apos;t it ?
and what are you going to say ?
and they &apos;re trying to do that .
so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact .
so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible .
basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity .
in the meanwhile , the old mentality with a capital o , was represented by his father , the head of the nigerian bank , warning the cia that his own son was about to attack , and this warning fell on deaf ears .
and so , i was able to put that into this story , which is an alphabet , and hopefully go on to something else .
people worry about overpopulation ; they say , &quot; well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing st. giles carelessly .
the rest turns into a stable compound , which survives filtration into the water systems , thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains .
in the process , we will gain about a million good jobs , mainly rural .
we &apos;re not used to it , and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .
so basically , kids of all ages , like us .
and yet , it never happens .
so , thank you very much , evan . ew : thank you .
so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
there &apos;s a significant delta , in fact , between what we &apos;re willing to accept .
if you &apos;ve been in a restaurant kitchen , you &apos;ve seen how much food , water and energy can be wasted there . chef arthur potts-dawson shares his very personal vision for drastically reducing restaurant , and supermarket , waste -- creating recycling , composting , sustainable engines for good .
well , we &apos;ve tended to see the solutions in terms of ngos , in terms of philanthropy .
but then by the end of the decade , the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .
perhaps the universe existed before the bang , and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .
we are harangued , lectured to , sold , marketed , but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication .
or start at the bottom , and say what outcomes do we want , and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect .
and now , using a joystick , they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right , forwards or backwards .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
and that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere , particularly of the political blogosphere , and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful , decentralized , bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .
just a little toy . which leads me to the next thing , which is -- what have i got here ? ok . all right .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
so if i take this salt dough , again , it &apos;s like the play-dough you probably made as kids , and i plug it in -- it &apos;s a two-lead battery pack , simple battery pack , you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up .
but if 300 million people in the u.s .

daylight , you could call it , transparency .
and he shows up on their porch , their doorstep , with a toothbrush and pajamas , and he &apos;s ready to spend the week with them .
but if you text now , or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it &apos;s become , you &apos;ll notice that lol does not mean laughing out loud anymore .
it would be their airplane tails .
and something ... good luck with that one in the japanese translation room .
fifty years ago , when i began exploring the ocean , no one -- not jacques perrin , not jacques cousteau or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
there &apos;s two things you can do to help stop this -- a simple thing and a complicated thing , an easy thing and a hard thing .
how should we figure it out ?
so we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set .
the next movement is called montage .
they also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops .
and of course , lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects .
it looks terrible . is it a little hot plate ?
the contractors , they don &apos;t like that .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
something like this , these are all this species globe skimmer .
we can only make them , quote , &quot; pirates . &quot; and is that good ?
it &apos;s not . i come from a place where kids can buy 35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment , where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor .
but you do it , by -- what i just-- you know , you do experiments , and you write down things sometimes , you make observations , you know .
and i &apos;ve put the formula up there .
so i think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally .
and i &apos;m thinking , no , this is not possible .
&quot; pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
but , actually , it &apos;s suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen -- that &apos;s methane -- it just floats off .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developer &apos;s conference , turned around and said -- and i quote -- &quot; i hate games . waste of life . imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time . &quot;
basically , it took a billion years to have life on earth .
if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there , but if we go extinct we never will .
he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to , and clearly someone recently -- i saw in a science magazine -- they said , well , the 1918 flu is too dangerous to fedex around .
and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition .
but think for a moment what that means .
you &apos;re watching a video .
why not personal biotech ?
just buy the software , you design it . i won &apos;t say anymore , you can take it on from there . it &apos;s going to happen , and i think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural , becomes part of the human condition , something that everybody &apos;s familiar with and everybody accepts .
one of the other things about the camel &apos;s beautiful design is that its penis points backwards .
nk : thank you .
and that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it .
a lot of people won &apos;t take them , or stop taking them , because of their unpleasant side effects .
and they &apos;re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the byproduct of their industry -- with osb and particle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover .
and i said , &quot; do you really ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
and so he came up with this theory , and he said , this will be cool , because it &apos;ll be a longer growing season in sweden , you know , and the surfers liked it , the surfers thought , that &apos;s a cool idea , because it &apos;s pretty cold in the ocean sometimes , and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad , you know .
it &apos;s up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
that &apos;s right . according to scientists , a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions .
the very word terror is global .
no . it was retreating through the winter because it &apos;s an unhealthy glacier .
in fact we &apos;ve done two more blue zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true .
we &apos;re at the long tail end here .
hm : well , the intrinsic motivation should be to learn .
i said , &quot; but i can use my hands , &quot; and he said , &quot; okay . &quot;
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
and yes , by the way , it is fast food : it &apos;s sloppy joes , it &apos;s burgers , it &apos;s wieners , it &apos;s pizzas , it &apos;s all of that stuff .
in fact , i don &apos;t think , overall , that i &apos;ve been as excited by anything ever in my life .
no , you can &apos;t .
and those actually came from my dad .
neil turok : so tendai came to aims and did very well .
and so i &apos;m going to invite you to take a risk with me .
so what accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that , i &apos;m not sure .

we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
we haven &apos;t included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
and i think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics , very long-term dynamics over the short term , and getting some sense of what we &apos;re doing now , what it &apos;s going to be like in 100 years , i think probably is the most effective thing i can be doing to help the world .

the more democratic our societies have been , the more equal they have been becoming .
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness .

and this is another thing that i did -- you know working -- everybody loves to watch somebody draw , but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in -- a lot of people at the same time , to evidence a single drawing .
and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors , and these robots can fly indoors without gps .
clay was with us in port-au-prince . he was also with us in chile .
so let &apos;s take one problem that families face , crazy mornings , and talk about how agile can help .

audience member : what kind of triggers are you looking for ?
i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night , shop for parisian macarons , and leave video messages that get picked up later .

i and my colleagues art aron and lucy brown and others , have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional mri brain scanner .

so when we would look at cells , this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope .
people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist .
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion , and i &apos;m going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams , a dear friend who , if he never came to ted , certainly should have been invited .
and so it &apos;s really -- it &apos;s really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997 , which is the time of abacha -- the military dictatorship , the worst part of nigerian history , this post-colonial history .

the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 -- the year alberto giacometti made &quot; the palace at four in the morning . &quot;
that &apos;s the problem that we &apos;re trying to solve at romotive -- that i and the other 20 nerds at romotive are obsessed with solving .
you can wait as long as you want , but only when you want the pressure released .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
communication , the next c. this is critical .
i didn &apos;t give up , and there was action behind these words .
the first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
a third of all the people commute by bike .
it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
it is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging .
and 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from mali , the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe .

that lets me know the context .
that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project .
so i find myself asking : where is music in all of this ?
and you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been asleep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five valiums -- you know , they &apos;re all over the place .
i like the physical book .
the technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable .
and yet , i &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
thank you very much .
you all remember ted kaczynski , the unabomber ?
we can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the rp7 ; if i &apos;m a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital .
now , here , shakespeare gives the thing , juliet , a name that belongs to something else , the sun .

one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok .

and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron , and which archaeologists have found , that in present-day palestine , there are evidences of that generation .

one , don &apos;t build a reformer on a fault .
we &apos;re dealing with irrationalisms , and we &apos;re dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist , and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four , and if you get 4.0 it &apos;s better , and 4.000 is even better .

here &apos;s a picture i took last tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and i ride with them tomorrow also .
we need groups to work together that never have .
and that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way .
the thing that really amazes me is that , today , people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games .
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l.a. airport .
ok .
i rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body .
and when i got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
these are major issues .
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
you want to be able to open it up , crack it open , look at the wiring inside .
and she was a tedster , exactly , and she showed us , she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again .
the conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually , there &apos;s a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance .
because simple answers may emerge .
for me , the world is veering towards a future we don &apos;t much want when we really think about it deep inside .
this is rocket science , but it &apos;s not hard rocket science .
and we all share this incredible heritage darkly pigmented , two million to one and half million years ago .
jack andraka : a promising test for pancreatic cancer ... from a teenager
my son still had his dad .
i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot;
the others were brothers , sisters .
there &apos;s no feeling about germs .
where do you sleep ? we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground , because the winds on antarctica were so extreme , it would blow anything else away .

thank you .
now invoking einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us , but actually it is .
we will fly where the methane is .
when leaving your laboratory tomorrow , i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step , struggling to maintain their trunk .

&quot; what is worth dying for ? &quot;
i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide .
i have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device .
just a year after redesigning this newspaper in poland , they name it the world &apos;s best-designed newspaper .
that &apos;s not necessarily something we didn &apos;t know already .
so amongst hannah &apos;s many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites .
the way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites .
this is followed by a text panel , it &apos;s designed in scroll form , in which i construct the narrative at stake .

why is this happening ? why this confidence ?
i was there . she was peeling this palm frond apart , these little threads off of it , and she &apos;d roll the threads together and make little thicker threads , like strings , and she would weave the strings together , and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days , the materiality of the way the world works , of reality , kind of started to unravel in my mind , because i realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener , everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to , maybe a more complicated one , but still , everything was made that way .
and these were all grown from seeds . we &apos;re learning everything .
or , as nancy said before , like really immerse oneself into it .
you can be thrown off the track .
on this side , there &apos;s a different experience .
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .

peter gabriel : so torture is not something that always happens on other soil .
your arm or body moves , and you get sensory feedback from vision , from skin , from muscles and so on .
life also has a metabolism . now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself .
and they say , &quot; will you build it in my district ? &quot;
in order to do that , well , i don &apos;t know how to do that .
now when you &apos;re in an fmri scanner , you &apos;re in a big magnet that &apos;s aligning your molecules in certain areas .
because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation .
i said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s like a suicide army . &quot;
if we cannot use smart biomaterials , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?

i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience .
and let &apos;s face it , designers , we need to reinvent ourselves .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
we had decidedly low-tech communications .
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .

actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
so , i was born two days after christmas .
i would say here is where religious leaders come in , because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people , at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think .
pragmatic chaos is , like all of netflix algorithms , trying to do the same thing .
this is our femtosecond laser lab .
that means we &apos;re generating them from scratch .
of course evolution is somewhat random , and you know , about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said , oh , the heck with the coral reefs -- we &apos;re going to head to the high seas .
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration -- like a human ear , inner ear .
so what do you do ?
we have a real , major outbreak of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .
but as you can see , the pigeon , or a chicken or anything else , another bird , has kind of a weird-looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
and it prevents them from forming those chains , those mitotic spindles , that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells .

rl : so , what i did is basically i had another screening room experience where i was basically tracking where i was looking , or where we were looking , and of course you &apos;re looking at the two people on the bow of the ship , and then at some point , i &apos;m changing the periphery of the shot , i &apos;m changing , it &apos;s becoming the rusted wreck , and then i would run it every day , and then i would find exactly the moment that i stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it , and the moment my eye shifted , we just marked it to the frame .
and i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m unique .
here &apos;s a bit more .
so , i &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
i said , &quot; great . what do you do ? &quot;
and willie brown said , &quot; as sure as i &apos;m the mayor of san francisco , i &apos;m going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city . &quot;

for 35 years i &apos;ve been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind , and i &apos;ve concluded that that &apos;s one of the urban myths .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
i think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
to deny that that &apos;s the case is not a very good start on that .
but instead i saw this .
john hunter : teaching with the world peace game

we think , ken and i , that there are real sources of hope .
it weighs about 50 lbs .

and it &apos;s really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow , if you don &apos;t know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean .
we take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice .
at the end of the night , i stripped and let everyone draw on me .

the life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old -- roughly the same as in afghanistan and somalia .
and the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars , and they &apos;re bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets , and the informed player &apos;s going to get the rest .
and it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .

they do , like , three years &apos; retreat , where they do meditate 12 hours a day .
it &apos;s like the old las vegas used to be .

these new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results .
but one thing that i want to say , because it &apos;s similar to what his holiness said .

it depends on us taking the third side .
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout , pleading with me to write to their parents , to help them slow down , to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .

because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
but behind the icon , there &apos;s complex code .
so in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans .
more recently , because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer , which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure , to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system , without regard to institutional models .

the mit media lab &apos;s john maeda lives at the intersection of technology and art , a place that can get very complicated . here he talks about paring down to basics .
then you &apos;ve also lied .

the people who supported it were the air force , which meant that it was all secret .
hospital-acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the united states than die from aids or cancer or car accidents combined -- about 100,000 .

and so , we &apos;re talking about parallel planes of existence , sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers .
he said , &quot; okay . &quot;
this is a very un-pc cover . not in new york .
you &apos;re really left alone with your own thoughts .
and this isn &apos;t just a problem in britain .
in ethiopia , there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program .
so i want to see a completely renewed , changed math curriculum built from the ground up , based on computers being there , computers that are now ubiquitous almost .
several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
well obviously this is a replica .
now , by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world &apos;s land , you are changing macroclimate .
there &apos;s my perspective . because in reality , the problem isn &apos;t how to make the world more technological .
but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers .
but this is a story -- it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
and actually , it &apos;s really been pioneered by alexa internet , which donates this collection to the internet archive .
what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r &amp; amp ; d center in usa and in india , and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u.s. and a similar patent filed out of the same company &apos;s subsidiary in india , so he &apos;s now comparing the patents of r &amp; amp ; d centers in the u.s. with r &amp; amp ; d centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the u.s. centers ?
can we run that , andrew ?
and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
so here , i grab -- you know this ? five of clubs ...
and we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull , and flip the market .
if you look at most buildings , what you look at is the building , the facade , and it is the building .
now , what is game theory about ?
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goose whisperer .
&quot; you come to work . how come you &apos;re so happy ? &quot;
but i won &apos;t , because i &apos;m 80 years old . this is my eightieth year , and i know that my time is brief .
second , it &apos;s a symbol of not only his identity ; it &apos;s a symbol of his income , because all of his assets are tied up in sheep .
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
and in my idea , heaven is satisfied curiosity .
and i don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works .
but equally important is to preserve things that are important for function .
the majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
you turn on the loudspeaker , and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets , the sound just kind of goes where it wants .
in this , elvis is following aristotle &apos;s classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
we all look the same inside , believe me .
that &apos;s a big deal .
on october 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
and i &apos;m trying to play possum .
but this is hypothesis-generating .
i don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
all right , so let &apos;s go back to another bet that you made with yourself , i guess , a kind of crazy bet .
thank you , james , for your great inspiration .
but the great change came , of course , with globalization and deregulation .
and then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray , and they hop up and help themselves .
but opportunities , boy oh boy , they exist .
and they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
they don &apos;t have any conveniences .
the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week , 10 hours per week , 15 hours per week .
my brief , as you &apos;ve just heard , is to tell you about statistics -- and , to be more precise , to tell you some exciting things about statistics .
and here &apos;s scaling of cities .
and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
and that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
and he goes , &quot; last year , my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka , because we couldn &apos;t afford proper treatment for her , &quot; and he said , &quot; this mustache is my tribute to my mom . &quot;
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
obviously , one of the most important things was the sheep , and so my job was , well , pretty much to do everything , but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead .
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
so sorry . &quot;
showing a series of inspiring , unusual and playful products , british branding and design guru paul bennett explains that design doesn &apos;t have to be about grand gestures , but can solve small , universal and overlooked problems .
and unique high-ankle design and human-like looks , &#91; unclear &#93; and functions .
and i said in the beginning , i wasn &apos;t going to tell you about exports .
a large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of paris .
noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years , and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there .
so my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds .
and this is the answer -- we would have to change .
you can touch it .
so , one thing i would like the medical community , and the legal community , and even the college community , to see if they can understand , that indeed , romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on earth .
and here i am with a pregnant woman , who is hiv positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
it &apos;s the same pattern at many different scales .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to make this a real biennial .
and little goals kept me going along the way , and eventually i got my private pilot &apos;s license , and then i learned to navigate , and i flew my friends around australia .
according to that story , early humans developed the conceit that , by using their language to work together , they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven .
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
another , another three-digit -- -- another three-digit number , sir ?
to say i wonder is to say i question , i ask .
and , as an outgrowth of all of this then , i wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transporting earth-type life to other planets .
another example , a beautiful thing happened .
so , i &apos;ve taken it apart , component by component , months and months and months of work .
and learning is most likely a self-organizing system .
a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement .
so then i grab a bunch of them and i put them on a boat .
because when i was capturing traces , you know , this thought comes to me always : is it , only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace , or is there other ways to capture it ? &quot;
just briefly , what &apos;s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
the definition of concussion doesn &apos;t actually require a loss of consciousness .
so we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
but the pace wasn &apos;t fast enough for us .
if i could summarize this in one sentence , it would be this : mathematics is not just solving for x , it &apos;s also figuring out why .
and then i thought about it a little bit , and i said , &quot; well , is it really that easy ?
we even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
essentially , for three reasons : calculation , application , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration .
and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope .
i &apos;m about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i &apos;m not trying to feed the habit .
and this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells , two cancer cells become four cancer cells , and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth .
because science data really goes back to , at best , world war ii , for the most part .
their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at , and i think it &apos;s really the scandal of the human genome project .
the crafty fox is this woman who &apos;s into crafts , and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around london .
in fact , if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at , the material they were collecting and examining , you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15 percent of cases where o.c. spray was used .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend &apos;s homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings , where a drink often cost more than what they &apos;d paid their 14-year-old maid .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about .
not psychology , biology .
now this is several years ago . adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
in 2008 i jumped the eiffel tower in paris .
first of all , we have all these things in our hands .
there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth . &quot;
deep .
thank you .
my name is joshua walters .
because in doing so , we &apos;re going to preserve what we &apos;ve really come to take for granted , which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world .
very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
thank you very much .
in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will invite back al-qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
that we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns , there &apos;s something beautiful looking back at you , that &apos;s deliberate .
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
this is a little hard to watch .
if you look at some of these other items -- concussions .
she &apos;s not licensed for that ; she has never done it .
there &apos;s no big mystery about it .
if we guess wisely , we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions .
and though i &apos;m a rock star , i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and why are they so similar ?
and , as chris says , there is a hunger for videos of me .
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .
and as you &apos;re thinking about that , what happens is you get more and more complexity , more and more stuff to build new things with .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
according to scientists , in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone .
and i &apos;m always looking around , like , where is my competition ?
a financial crisis , just as we have seen , could not be solved by america alone or europe alone ; it needed the world to work together .
i know , because i &apos;ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years .
polio and rhino : they &apos;re in the same family , very close to each other .
and things go white as we move out onto the arctic ocean .
so , i &apos;ve been really lucky as an inventor .
interestingly , complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations , so the usual physics approach doesn &apos;t really work here .
i was shocked .
and the world health organization predicts by the year 2020 that depression will be the second largest cause of disability .
how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting ?
so you say , &quot; aw , come on shermer , anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with an illusion like that . &quot;
i &apos;m talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood .
i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time , all right , start the clock please . 30 seconds studio .
alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- -- and i was there with a catcher &apos;s mitt .
so , here you have my last slide .
and this is -- well , at the time -- i did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the dalai lama had left .
i thank you very much for your time .
and i think we all found it , simultaneously , an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience .
and i don &apos;t want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it , until everyone &apos;s expressed a view . ok .
or should we respect his privacy , protect his dignity and leave him alone ?
the problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren &apos;t profitable to say .
naif al-mutawa : superheroes inspired by islam
with my visual artist colleagues , we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space , visually and sonically .
how did he not know -- it &apos;s what we &apos;ve all forgotten -- that we &apos;re not the first ones to build .
and we can guarantee a clean , blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power .
so that birds going to siberia , to europe , and to africa carried the virus , which had not previously been possible .
the number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls , or bladdersful , in the world -- and , of course , there &apos;s nothing special about cromwell or bladders . you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree .
and how about the long run ?
these are all very low-budget videos , like quick prototypes .
but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know .
here is an m.s. patient .
so , he wouldn &apos;t say much .
what this does is transforms , fundamentally , the farmers &apos; relationship to the market .
to do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
it &apos;s a matter of choice .
it &apos;s just the persians who aren &apos;t fully human and don &apos;t deserve to be treated very nicely .
i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
i started my journey 30 years ago .
the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence .
five to 10 thousand years ! now imagine this .
so , right now , we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips .
and , you know , i was the only female u.s. sprinter .
and each cloud is compacted , gravity gets more powerful as density increases , the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud , and then , at the center of each cloud , the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees , protons start to fuse , there &apos;s a huge release of energy , and , bam !
it will create huge opportunities in technology .
everything is based on the files leaked by mr. snowden .
tom hanks : hello , houston , this is odyssey .
so let me first start with the personal reason .
companies make goods , but governments , they make public goods . they work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads , but we don &apos;t have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity . we don &apos;t have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear , at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way .
first of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l.a .
i was still trying to take in the notion that these titans , these masters of the universe , in their spare time watch harry potter movies , when mr. milliken thought he would win the argument by saying , &quot; you just think it &apos;s so good because you didn &apos;t read the book . &quot;
and , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby .
this book is taking rather a long time , but i &apos;m nearly done .
fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
there &apos;s another pile of leaves .
and we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him , we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe , and his universe is , you know , behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way , and we had to make it feel that this is his normal , everyday sort of life , so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important , and of course , in shooting in 3d , which is basically it &apos;s a huge camera that &apos;s hanging off of a giant stick , so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task , and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the &quot; goodfellas &quot; shot .
like i said , contagious is a good word .
and , again , that &apos;s where these new technologies can come in .
i say that because these are difficult patients .
well , avatars are a way to express our true selves , our most heroic , idealized version of who we might become .
this is a blog from iraq , and it &apos;s not really what i &apos;m going to talk about , but i just wanted to show you an example .
but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens &apos; favorite form of protein .
and so , the assignment to the students was , how should the steak of tomorrow be ?
there must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality , and yet , one can be able to fund them .
and that &apos;s the deep sea , that &apos;s the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on earth .
another thing is , sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone , they are bigger than the phone itself .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
terrifyingly accurate matching .
and if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very specific organ .
but i think what &apos;s kept me still coming back year after year is another thing , and that is the look on her face , the conflicted look on her face .
so what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
well , a good answer is , &quot; it depends . what is it ? &quot;
now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -- same way -- had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively .
and finally , about 100 years ago , the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television .
we start on day one of every project -- we &apos;ve learned , we don &apos;t make promises , we don &apos;t do reports .
and when jim shot it , it was only one sub , because he was photographing from the other , and i don &apos;t remember if i did this or jim did this .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
we can &apos;t just say , &quot; well , if they &apos;re young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they &apos;ll live 30 years longer . &quot;
i &apos;ll just swim right through them .
can you get down ?
so i want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
so they construct it , and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale . this is the work of design students from the royal college of arts in london that have been working together with their tutor , tony dunne , and with a bunch of scientists around great britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future .
so , if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance , by da vinci , galileo , the english scientist robert hook and then ernest chladni .
but i gotta have my hot dog .
what it requires , as geraldine carter has discovered , is to be able to say , &quot; i can &apos;t do this by myself .
so in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
we also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
it did not evolve for natural survival .
they didn &apos;t give the forms to me or explain what was in the form .
and my proposal was to split the museum into two -- the permanent exhibits at one end , the auditorium , library , and changing exhibitions on the other -- to flood the valley into a series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown .
it was a big story . mel gibson did the sequel .
it &apos;s a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
but however you put it , you know , the numbers do not make any sense .
and just down the road , this is jet .
beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it &apos;s quite interesting , is use of the first person singular -- &quot; i , &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; my , &quot; not &quot; we &quot; and &quot; us &quot; -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone .
we are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way .
china &apos;s dalian commodity exchange , three years ago , 2004 , overtook the chicago board of trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world .
there are , of course , more than those three projects that i &apos;m showing here .
imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass .
we hold another conference .
around 2004 , in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth , this vision came to fruition .
in that one single piece of ice , you have 300 species of microorganisms .
i think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
as the senior officer approaches with a baton , layma stands up with deliberation , reaches her arms up over her head , and begins , very slowly , to untie her headdress that covers her hair .
what could be easier , more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak ?

she was just released a couple of weeks ago , and we &apos;re very concerned to see how long she will be free , because she is already out in the streets in rangoon , agitating for change .
pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness , which i think is a terrible thing .
from that point , you can then , if you want to , acquire multiple languages , alternate them so there is no interference .
til then , i &apos;ll keep telling jokes . i hope you keep laughing .
no video here , so you can focus on the sound , the acoustics , of a new kind of trajectory : gaga to water .
and if you blow those up , they have these little structures on the end .
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
because in the last four years we &apos;ve seen all kinds of memes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page .
so this is more challenging -- large organ , vascular , a lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of cells present .
so then , what do we do about that ?
but i shouldn &apos;t have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality .
since 1990 , we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet .
the titanium &apos;s several thousand dollars , but the forms are very cheap .
and it &apos;s the bicentenary of charles darwin .
and so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually , at agnor-hurt school in albemarle county -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; mr. hunter , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot;
some day , perhaps soon , we &apos;ll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
you can add a third dimensionality to the film .
and it &apos;s no longer just a &quot; i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t get there . i guess i &apos;ll move on , &quot; but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online .
but now it &apos;s a door .
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
girl : yes i do . i remember writing every chapter .
he tried to negotiate syria and couldn &apos;t do it .
but in chinese language , it &apos;s really about 140 characters , means a paragraph , a story .
freud had it right .

indeed , arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .
it ain &apos;t happening , hasn &apos;t happened for 30 years , ok ?
could we calm them down -- they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up -- and make them to the level of the normal ?
so you open the box and you think , &quot; whoa , there &apos;s a snake in there . &quot;
now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number , i want you just for a second to think of a million people .
because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children .
so , i did it .
and i have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
it could perhaps be a self-organizing system , so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you , that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective .
now , the reality is , the food that your kids get every day is fast food , it &apos;s highly processed , there &apos;s not enough fresh food in there at all .
so i couchsurf a lot . i also crowdsurf a lot .
in &quot; wonders of the solar system , &quot; we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal .
this is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don &apos;t know .
we have a battery bay . it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .
but it is too late .
and this object knows , better than you and probably before you , what you really need .
i doodled a lot as a kid , and if you spend enough time doodling , sooner or later , something happens : all your career options run out .
that &apos;s enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 american households .

most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
it &apos;s not .
they developed an artificial coition machine .
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
we had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network .
the answer came , &quot; the problem isn &apos;t the people that you chose . the problem is that you chose them . &quot;
so i started doing that .
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .
i got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m .
so , one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys , and i said , &quot; how do you paint like that ? who taught you ? &quot;

it &apos;s really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of ; she &apos;s called gillian lynne -- have you heard of her ? some have . she &apos;s a choreographer and everybody knows her work .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
in other cultures , they paint themselves like &quot; lord of the flies . &quot;
this information is also pretty staggering .
you &apos;re an nba player . it represents your income .
lots of complex stuff .
in november of 2003 , i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela &apos;s 46664 foundation -- that is his hiv / aids foundation .
the first one ?
but really , it &apos;s pretty robust .
joseph kim : the family i lost in north korea . and the family i gained .
david : ambition to be a doctor .
and a few rise to the surface .
now , in a group with so many it people , i do have to mention what i &apos;m not going to talk about , and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things , on the software side . so there &apos;s computers that protect themselves , like an immune system , and we &apos;re learning from gene regulation and biological development . and we &apos;re learning from neural nets , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computing .
once you &apos;ve got the mosquito in your area , anyone coming into that area with dengue , mosquito will bite them , mosquito will bite somewhere else , somewhere else , somewhere else , and you &apos;ll get an epidemic .
and they fly into the erupting volcano .
now , cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species .
and thirdly , as i said , most of the animations are very repetitive because of that .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
incentivize them . that &apos;s how business works .
that &apos;s why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
it &apos;s good to start with some examples .
and all that raises , of course , the question : what can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity , high levels of performance , and raised outcomes ?
it &apos;s the drone . what is the drone ?
and if we &apos;re going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it &apos;s in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true .
in my graduate years i worked with my colleague and mentor and friend , steve schneider , at the national center for atmospheric research , working on global change issues .
so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory in california , which is a particle accelerator .
my only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night i also thought of what else i could do to honor him .
we expect more from technology and less from each other .
we &apos;ve also described another species of bipedal octopus .
and so this really shifts the human / plant dynamic , because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time .
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
they were around me in three directions .
mt : well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that i received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , i have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens .
today , i am standing on the ted stage with the yo-yo in front of you .
a little dance , and then heads off in a particular direction .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it isn &apos;t going up -- it &apos;s not going up at all . we &apos;ve doing it very carefully now for 20 years , from satellites , and it isn &apos;t going up .
i wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it , too -- the magic of it .
and researchers want to know why .
thank you .
and i &apos;ll walk you through a few of those now .
in this school , there was a simple idea : to create comfort in a classroom .
photographer james balog shares new image sequences from the extreme ice survey , a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers receding at an alarming rate , some of the most vivid evidence yet of climate change .
the cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
and so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . we &apos;re planning a permanent home in chicago .
and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up .
in this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing , certainly in the u.k. , to within an area that &apos;s small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim .
most people say not that much .
and just before alex died at the age of 96 , he gave me a gift .
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
so here -- this is the car seat . now watch two things : watch how the head goes forward , and basically hits the knees -- and this is in the car seat -- and watch how the car seat flies around , in the rebound , up in the air .
and that moved us to the next level .
these are all handmade .
is there a sustainable solution ?
so for example , if someone said , &quot; my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , good news .
well , i really care about 1980 because it &apos;s also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year .
it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation .
how few genes can i use ?
this is what we found in our reporting . &quot;
this has huge implications .
we wrote a book recently , i think you might have received it , called &quot; thoughtless acts ? &quot;
nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
ph : would you like to be the president of a tv network ?
instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster .
please keep your seat .
i mean , your grandparents had these great big cones , and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner , and now we have these little buds that nobody sees .
if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs .
and we were thrilled to be able to show it here .
it was finally being in my body .
then when we went to press , the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running .
would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? &quot;
and euclid said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ?
it &apos;s remarkable : the position .
now , i might be at ground zero for this .
once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa .
so , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
it makes it more organic , more natural .
we invented the whole lot of them .
the epa estimates , in the united states , by volume , this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills .
if anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; star trek , &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and spock said , &quot; they &apos;re very technically sophisticated .
i remember what you said to me .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it &apos;s also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
roundabouts are much better .
what is it that shapes us ? and we live in a therapy culture .
the international community still hasn &apos;t found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
ok , so i &apos;d like you to take a little away from this .
it &apos;s therefore probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee , and as these two species are now man &apos;s nearest allies , it &apos;s somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere . &quot;
i really miss that era , you know , where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you .
we live in a digital world , but we &apos;re fairly analog creatures .
nine months later , after that day on snot rock , i had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called kanchi .
sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
so , in a very real sense , i believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task .
i wish i had more wishes but three is what i &apos;ve got and there they are .
the soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
can you just raise the hand ?
they &apos;re all building cities on the model that we invented in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , which is really obsolete , i would argue , and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world .
what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale , and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
the science writers and editors -- i shouldn &apos;t say science writers , i should say people who write about science -- and editors would sit down over a couple of beers , after a hard day of work , and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works .
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right .
there is no miracle cure , but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year , and we can do the same thing .
it was very hard , you know , to impose my authority .
one is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab , we have this image -- you know , they &apos;re pouring over the microscope , and they see something in the tissue sample .
bf : yeah , it &apos;s a good setup . that &apos;s a big setup .
now in hindsight , it was actually good for some things , like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid , but at the time this was really doomsday .
but that &apos;s not a usual case in history .
now when people ask this kind of question , they neglect something , which is that physicists are really clever , unlike biologists .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three-dimensional folding .
the new chaos theory is already old , right ?
okay , this tendency we have , this seemingly natural tendency we have , towards isolation , towards keeping to ourselves , crashes head first into our modern world .
it turned out that -- len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football , and played bridge -- len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .
their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas .
it &apos;s one part of the form and content .
and that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
it &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
google glass : อร ่ อยman 9 : mmm , อร ่ อย .
this is very strange for me , because i &apos;m not used to doing this : i usually stand on the other side of the light , and now i &apos;m feeling the pressure i put other people into . and it &apos;s hard ...

so , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
as removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in 1890 , or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago , i still have to ask you the question , how should you feel about the statistics of today ?
it &apos;ll help my breathing . it &apos;ll do something for my pulse , maybe .
then last minute , i &apos;m thinking , &apos; can &apos;t do this . this is wrong . &apos; my buddy says , &apos; c &apos;mon , let &apos;s do this . &apos; i say , &apos; let &apos;s do this . &apos; &quot; and those three words , tony &apos;s going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop .
poetry .
what &apos;s happening to the climate ?
but the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water .
how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
he told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this .
well i &apos;m going to say no .
we forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments , and we feel like millionaires .
we make certain things harder and easier to do .
an effect happens in the air , it &apos;s a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that &apos;s emitted , but it &apos;s so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect .
it &apos;s my first year as a new high school science teacher , and i &apos;m so eager .
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day , and they were saying there &apos;s this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill .
so this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae .
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
and i want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government , because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today .
i learned about compassion .
&quot; another time . &quot;
so all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the internet .
my story started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents .

but you can also talk about sunny places .
architect thom mayne has never been one to take the easy option , and this whistle-stop tour of the buildings he &apos;s created makes you glad for it . these are big ideas cast in material form .

it &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
it &apos;s called &quot; peace on earth . &quot;
we also allow dogs and things like that , and we &apos;ve had , i think , a really fun culture at our company , which helps people work and enjoy what they &apos;re doing .
i mean , just to put it in perspective , 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool .
well , i can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
we &apos;d lay on top of that the soils and the waters , and illuminate the landscape .
in europe , a similar legislation was not introduced .
their entire camp , every item of gear , was ferried 885 miles from mcmurdo station , the main u.s. supply base on the coast of antarctica .
and i started in nature , because i saw these guaymís doing it in nature , and there just seems to be less barriers .
and the folks in ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns and would use them strategically .
why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
we &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
and let me tell you this story .
and , &quot; he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug . &quot;
a flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking , climbing or swimming animal .
most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
what i did -- because of the paris skies being quite dull , i made a light grid that &apos;s perpendicular to the train station , to the route of the train .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
but there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this -- that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
so instead i use the jerry maguire approach to research .
in this case , he &apos;s wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize .
a three-digit number , sir , yes ?
and you have to have -- you can &apos;t do a vc pitch without giving me your financials .
it &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away .
now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
a teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .
now remember kurdistan is landlocked .
this is a polio vaccine .
the drive to do things cause they matter .
in other words , our fears make us think about the future .
there is going to be no turning back .
but it doesn &apos;t matter that much that we &apos;re putting too much emphasis on that ?
the leopard -- they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village , because the natural plain has multiplied , like zebras , springboks and everything .
and in this way i could find noor , the hidden light of afghanistan .
the phrase &quot; god is subtle &quot; appears again and again , and indeed , the whole of the koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe .
as we age , we deteriorate , and this deterioration causes problems for our society , so we have to address it .
but if you give talks to kids , you know , one in 50 of them , some light bulb goes off , and they think , &quot; gee , i &apos;d never thought of that , &quot; and then they go , you know , read a book or a magazine or whatever .
i went to turin in may .
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
and it &apos;s a crisis that has its structural facet -- it &apos;s partly to do with demographics .

and the year i went to school , my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization called irdnc , integrated rural development and nature conservation .
we get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right .

someone made that mistake already so i can &apos;t do it anymore .
dan ariely : beware conflicts of interest
it was an offering , an invitation .
goodbye , abraham lincoln .
and lastly , and i think perhaps most importantly , we should be creating materials that fit into what i call nature &apos;s recycling system .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
you need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work .
i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail .
and something that motivates me , and what gets me really excited about my research , is when i see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population .
so , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results .
there is no newspaper to cover her pain , and what she wants to change in this society .
von mises completely rejected this distinction .

we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
they kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
because for those of us who live in democracies , or in aspiring democracies , the law begins with us .

we &apos;re sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .
i mean , gene -- thank god for gene .
very funny .
but one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt . and every three months or so these animals molt , and they build a new limb and it &apos;s no problem .
i &apos;d like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my &quot; grand unified theory of predicting the future , &quot; but it &apos;s closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future .

life becomes an episode of &quot; the sopranos . &quot; hobbes &apos; solution , the &quot; leviathan , &quot; was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack , because any kind of aggression will be punished , leaving its profitability as zero . that would remove the temptation to invade preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you first .
we can look at some of the data .
so you may be asking , well why is it important that i know what entertains people ?
what &apos;s your name ? where are you from ?
now this is different than transparency .
as you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
it was abraham path day .
why did we not find some other solution to this ?
we &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
this is an opener for brian eno , and it &apos;s just kind of my personal interpretation of the music .
but the object on the right was made for me by other people .

there &apos;s diatoms made out of sio2 , and they &apos;re magnetotactic bacteria that make small , single-domain magnets used for navigation .
describe it . how happy did it make you ? &quot;
thank you .
with the revolution around 1980 of p.c. &apos; s , the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers , not to replace office workers , but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers .
congratulations . mazel tov .
even more worrying for the americans , in december 2008 the holiest of holies , the it systems of centcom , the central command managing the wars in iraq and afghanistan , may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these : plain but infected usb keys .
in the health care system , if you touch average , you &apos;re done .
you can read the text .
this is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through recaptch 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
there are many .
they don &apos;t really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up .
but , what if we &apos;re not ?
so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room , which was lovely .

so , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
in a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox -- and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch .
it seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thinks that these problems are important .
but even this is not a fair representation of africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in africa .
now if you look at biology , there &apos;s many structures like dna and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you &apos;ve heard about that are already nano-structured .
so the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ?
so what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business .
&quot; weibo &quot; is the chinese translation for &quot; microblog &quot; .
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
i want to know what the business model is on a sort of per-unit basis , or for the actual product that you &apos;re selling .
the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power .
and you can see certain biases that come up again and again .
but that &apos;s , i think , what this is all about , is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
they can actually also move towards the light . you have to just choose your species .
there &apos;s a similar story for my electricity consumption , where switching off the dvd players , the stereos , the computer peripherals that were on all the time , and just switching them on when i needed them , knocked another third off my electricity bills too .
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?
this -- sorry -- -- that &apos;s a solar seed . it &apos;s a concept for new architecture .
obama appealed to virtue .

so it &apos;s kind of like you having a job in chicago , and then you get transferred to st. louis , and your mate is not happy about this because you &apos;ve got to pay airfare , because you &apos;re gone longer .
but be very careful about these projections such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century .
they have grown their population but not much more .
i march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors , but i never have the decency to honor their names .
he has personal experiences that i would give my left leg to have in my head .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
and then you need to add some more ports , and more .
that &apos;s right -- flies , like people , have dopamine , and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and i have .
the first step is pattern recognition .
or at least , they shouldn &apos;t if they &apos;re interested in reproducing . that -- is not the way any human being speaks casually .
they &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
but this does not apply the other way around .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
you know , they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process .
we start up here on the boat , and for all this high-tech , expensive equipment , this is still the best way to get in the water -- just pfft ! -- flop over the side of the boat .
so she took it .
thank you .
so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way , because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .
marcus : simple . what do you rap about ?
in terms of the shipping noise , the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships , to tell the industry how you could quiet ships .
the number of people living in countries not their own now comes to 220 million , and that &apos;s an almost unimaginable number , but it means that if you took the whole population of canada and the whole population of australia and then the whole population of australia again and the whole population of canada again and doubled that number , you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe .
and they have some wonderful properties .
and most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created .
americans on both sides care about global poverty and aids , and on so many humanitarian issues , liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies , and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems .
can ethiopia do this ?
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distinctive stage .
and there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater specialization , sentience , ubiquity and most important , evolvability : those very same things are also present in technology .
so let me just leave you with three things .
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
so our engineering students went to work on it , and with some very simple changes , they were able to triple the throughput of this device .
some guy &apos;s got that on a computer -- there &apos;s this like , oh my goodness .
so , in soap , fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent , but also for giving it a pearl-like effect .
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
keep in mind that , although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate , what &apos;s really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior .
but i was quickly told that , &quot; boy , our government doesn &apos;t really work like that . &quot;
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
people were so empowered .
so we were careful with that .
you &apos;re all so responsible for this world that we live in today .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
and had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
on your right is an eight-year-old .
one nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
it turns out that , whenever you have that system , weird stuff happens , and you in los angeles probably know this better than anyone .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
you could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it helvetica or something : it is the actual article .
so , if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes , remember this : that the light that falls on to your eye , sensory information , is meaningless , because it could mean literally anything .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
we might say the recovery act , but those didn &apos;t require policy changes .
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life .
also , while we were at the table , there was a ritual in our family : when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the pta , or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination , or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was , once the announcement is made , we must take five , ten minutes to do what we call &quot; make over &quot; that person -- that is , to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way .
this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri , who renews the ball of the sun every morning , which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the pharaoh tutankhamun .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
who am i being , that my children &apos;s eyes are not shining ?
these are the dispensers . there &apos;s this friendly shape .
there is .
you don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
in fact , the west has lost its work ethic .
i worried that &#91; if &#93; i took my hat off i wouldn &apos;t be here anymore .
the next issue that resolved was that , if 90 percent of head and neck pain is caused by imbalance , the other 10 percent , largely -- if you set aside aneurysms , brain cancer and hormonal issues -- is the circulation .
and so naturally , i started to distance myself .
and i didn &apos;t realize that for three hours i &apos;m sitting at my desk , and i &apos;m not moving at all .
profound leaps forward !
1994 , rodrigo started something called cdi , which took computers donated by corporations , put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this .
so he summoned me and said , &quot; can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot;
mohamed nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
and luckily he agreed . and the theme , in two years , is going to be &quot; cute pictures of puppies . &quot;
what newspaper was it in ? what book ?
but if anybody did want to do that , that &apos;s the kind of thing we need to be thinking about , actually : fundamental opportunities to change human behavior .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of african countries have had multi-party democratic elections .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
they all came together .
so , we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points , integrated across everything we know about the patient .
they cannot be consciously contracted , especially if you overdid the botox .
so , now we clamor for organic food .
and madhav said , &quot; why do we have to do it that way ?
now , when we talk about suicide , there is also a medical contribution here , because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness : depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , anorexia , borderline personality . there &apos;s a long list of disorders that contribute , and as i mentioned before , often early in life .
it &apos;s our ability to write things down , our language and our consciousness .
hi .
now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart , and it had even been tried to image the breast .
this is the real secret stuff : how to get directed energy explosions so you &apos;re sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite , but you &apos;re directing it at the ship .
see , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
ah ha , right . second question is , why is the sea blue ? all right ?
and i can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an oldenburg .
james glattfelder studies complexity : how an interconnected system -- say , a swarm of birds -- is more than the sum of its parts . and complexity theory , it turns out , can reveal a lot about how the economy works . glattfelder shares a groundbreaking study of how control flows through the global economy , and how concentration of power in the hands of a shockingly small number leaves us all vulnerable .
so we &apos;ve been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .
however , bad things happen .
we &apos;ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
it was breaking the ice , it was getting over a stigma , and i think that &apos;s also what design can do .
this is art . &quot;
we don &apos;t , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
how far you can anticipate , what follows from it , what are the threats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing .
so there &apos;s another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
to move our continent forward , to do the things that need doing that i talked about -- getting young people employed .
and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
in the individual tutoring instruction , 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
it says , well , there &apos;s the sea , there are dunes , and i &apos;m here .
and the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
we &apos;re ready to go . all we need is a check from nasa headquarters to cover the costs .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
and it becomes this dangerous cycle .
and because of that announcement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deciding to become ceo of that company -- whereas i was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring .
philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you &apos;re seeing .
so some people think that these models sound well and good , but ask , &quot; well , are these really as good as the rat ? &quot;
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
and i will start the world like this .
lectures , problem-solving and so on . it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
and when we take that , we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again , in life &apos;s evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they &apos;re really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .
and it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and i tell you , i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a ph.d.-level tracker .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
and they kill lions .
and to be honest , sometimes i quite enjoyed their attention as well .
now that used to be a dangerous guessing game , because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened .
and it &apos;s probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw , and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
i hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and , in so doing , secure hope for humankind .
being quite disturbed , she called for comfort , and i didn &apos;t really know what to tell her , because we have to deal with so much mess in our society .
it &apos;s going to be britain &apos;s first ever national disabled orchestra .
stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years , this order against the entropy of the world .
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads , don &apos;t they ?
and i think that may very well be true , so i &apos;ll close with this .
my sister fell very ill with malaria .
i didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
i &apos;d broken my neck and my back in six places .
this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena , california , looking down over pasadena .
so the longer distances i ran , the bigger my dreams became , until one fateful morning , and while training , i was hit by a bus .
ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is republicans when it comes to military defense spending .
not agitated , calm . for which chamomile is very good .
who gets to use the mosque on fridays ? &quot;
&quot; but why ? &quot; i asked him .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well what &apos;s the point of these , heinrich ?
now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse .
i don &apos;t eat breakfast . no lunch .
so this turned out to be very simple to do .
but what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission . the japanese government called off their whaling expedition . mission accomplished .
and as it turns out , lots and lots of men wanted to date me .
i like to think that i do a thorough physical exam , but because the whole visit was now about the physical , i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
and while i was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp , or stomatopods , make sound , i started to think about their appendages .
and i said , well , that &apos;s fine ; i just would love to have your input on this film and this book , and he finally agreed to it .
it &apos;s the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things , including changing biology .
in the u.s. , it &apos;s one in five .
the interspecies internet ? an idea in progress
in about five years we will discover planets like earth , around sun-like stars , the same distance as the earth from the sun .
this is mountains out of molehills , a timeline of global media panic .
second fact : the president &apos;s new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .
why don &apos;t you sit down with kids and give them four items , a red shirt , a blue tie , a kangaroo and a laptop , and have them tell a story about those four things ?
i wish i could do that now .
previously known as the department of foreign propaganda , the state council information office is responsible for all of china &apos;s external publicity operations .
and so this picture , which looks like a big smudge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track .
and of course , we don &apos;t do these experiments in humans , but just by coincidence , my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count , low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine .
it &apos;s the fundamental force that we &apos;re all after .
because if you think about it , 1,000 tedtalks , that &apos;s over 1,000 ideas worth spreading .
chef : oh .
in barcelona , on las ramblas for some film festival , i did the hollywood sign going and coming , made a building out of it , and they built it .
what &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
there is not only in china , but also in the united states there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
you go into a museum and they take really good care of them .
75 minutes .
so , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
i went to a local shop , i tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet .
we need to make the best mathematical models we can , the most consistent ones .
so to summarize , if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free , what would that do ? three things .
a few years ago we had a film called rang de basanti , which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change .
you just said , &quot; i &apos;ll call you when i get there . &quot;
it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america .
and so every time that desire to interact with the animals , which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign : &quot; do not feed the animals . &quot;
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
a thousand years into this period , we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns .
and what &apos;s really neat about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nano-artwork , but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits .
so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways , the bigger lessons that i learned from my year .
countless moments of unsolicited natural moments , not posed moments , are captured there , and we &apos;re starting to learn how to discover them and find them .
we need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
that &apos;s the distance between us and andromeda , right ?
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
so let me give you a few examples here .
so don &apos;t put it there .
i can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of 10 , 20 people would caravan across the united states , and they would form companies .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing .
ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .
so i actually threw a pop quiz here onto rufus .
why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
but terrorists aren &apos;t the only threat we face .
so in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .
and so i was thinking about how it might be great if i could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else .
here &apos;s a great article about an important election race that &apos;s happening .
but we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds . i find that quite astonishing .
or clark gable , or whoever it is .
instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is &quot; ikigai . &quot;
but it was hard to do that when i was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren &apos;t working .
and there are flowers that are self-infertile . that means they can &apos;t -- the pollen in their bloom can &apos;t fertilize themselves .
so here i had the hope that by inserting some natural elements , if you want -- some fog -- i could make the space tangible .
and if you look closely , you &apos;ll see duping delight throughout this video .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in poland .
but once angiogenesis occurs , cancers can grow exponentially .
and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab , the islamic head cover .
when a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide , and it dies and it falls to the forest floor , it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground .
but you must do extremely well .
that seems dangerous .
now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in st. petersburg .
i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for alzheimer &apos;s and other diseases of aging , and we &apos;re making some real progress .
now , one bit of science before we get into the visuals .
all right , i &apos;m going to get on my knees and do it .
that is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way .
and the reason why that &apos;s happening is that , right now , in 2007 -- the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously , side by side .
in the case of the indus script , the problem is the reverse .
and of course , you can imagine , with humble masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred .
so therefore , if we were to do this , what we &apos;d need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it &apos;s the same or if it &apos;s different . so if it is the same , this indicates that that site is important for a function , so a disease mutation should fall within that site .
i don &apos;t really see it , i don &apos;t pay attention to it until there &apos;s , you know , like a bug that &apos;s dead on the window .
they said , &quot; well , we also believe that if you &apos;re a mormon and if you &apos;re in good standing with the church , when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity . &quot;
and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace .

there &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
he actively sought disconfirmation .
two-thirds of this room , today , in america , are statistically overweight or obese .

i told you three things last year .
now , visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities .
we &apos;re the new technologists .
and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter .
and to do that , you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine , in the early &apos; 80s , and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader .
we circle around flags , and then we can trust each other .
then i was telling my assistant , &quot; i don &apos;t see anything . can you paint it ? &quot;
and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that &apos;ll take care of their offspring .

milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
the first thing we actually shared with them was this .
and so what i &apos;d suggest is what i call independent service authorities .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
there are only a few species that can do it .
paradoxically , once established , natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .
a water strider &apos;s brain doesn &apos;t need 3d software at all , since it lives on the surface of the pond in an edwin abbott flatland .
everything boils down to that .
you don &apos;t know how far that street is and you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth , and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation .
unless the people that live here are munchkins , nobody &apos;s going to be using that .
because five years from now , it will blow you away what we &apos;ll actually have as alternatives to this horrible , disastrous nuclear power .
darfur may have slipped from the news headlines , but the killing and displacement there continues as well , and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom .
we know the children died .

it stands for mutually assured destruction .
and then another thing opens , you close that .
i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago , and some of you visited a to z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in east africa .
meditate for half an hour .
like i think you &apos;re missing the point here .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
over time , people do what you pay them to do . and if they judge how much they &apos;re going to get paid on your capital that they &apos;ve invested , based on the short-term returns , you &apos;re going to get short-term decisions .
we have 1.5 million enrollments , 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted , and 14 million videos have been viewed .
and this process , which takes just a millisecond or so , happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells , as long as you live and think and feel .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
but well , i &apos;m feeling good right now .
and i think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
and then you can send it to the kinko &apos;s store at the corner and go get your chair . now , the implications of this are enormous , not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process , but also no tracking , no warehousing , no wasted materials .
when they get a hankering for some treats , we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market .

look : u.s. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized u.s. aid .
women tend to get intimacy differently than men do .
survey after survey , from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy , has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows .
that &apos;s when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
you &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the centrifugal force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
that thing is called a captcha .
but really , where are those birds going to get released to ?
now it took about two weeks of processing on intel &apos;s highest-end servers to make this happen , and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data .
jennifer : a soldier walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
and he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of evian water on the table .

it &apos;s very simple , because chinese central government doesn &apos;t need to even lead the public opinion .
we &apos;ve made incredible advances in technology in recent years , but too often it seems only certain fortunate people can benefit . engineer krista donaldson introduces the remotion knee , a prosthetic device for above-knee amputees , many of whom earn less than $ 4 a day . the design contains best-in-class technology and yet is far cheaper than other prosthetics on the market .
now that very idea , i think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .
homework is another thing . there are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years , and now they &apos;re discovering that less can be more .

right , are you ready ? i &apos;m going to show you something for a very , very brief moment .
and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics , bionics -- with the age-old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
now imagine what that means for you , your family , your friends , your personal financial security .
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this .
so the developers say , well this is great . okay , so if we have a conventional building , we have a fixed envelope , maybe we can put in 14 units .

the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old .
marcus : a modern day poet .

okay . now we &apos;re going north , very far north .
on the ground , it &apos;s powered electrically .
well , basically the east was swallowed by the west .
mammography &apos;s the only one that &apos;s been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim .
now interestingly , among our subjects , some had posted comparable information , and some had not .
oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume .
good .
that says to me , it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub .
they became marine . we now know them today from the ice caps .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
so the patient &apos;s life is restored .
but when it &apos;s something other than water , and their water habitat changes , they don &apos;t have many options .
it &apos;s actually not massive enough .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; accelerator , break . accelerator , break . &quot;
in india there is a rape every three minutes .
and there &apos;s a little clock in the lower left-hand corner , so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
so i will do this .
so that &apos;s for fun .
this is another project i worked on with sensible cities lab and currentcity.org .
there are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects .
it &apos;s about 100 million such planets .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment .
great , right ? well , we have similar problems in buildings .
and so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don &apos;t want to do , it &apos;s very difficult .
what is the importance now with the relations here .
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .
and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
for instance , 47 percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes .
you find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs , etc .
health to the ocean means health for us .and the <T_2> of <T_3> parking , we <T_1> to make the <T_6> naturally <T_4> , <T_5> we needed <T_0> perforate it .
<T_4> again , in peterborough , we started off with <T_0> program , but we also <T_3> data , and over <T_2> period of time , we nuanced and changed that <T_1> to add a range of other elements , so that the service adapts and <T_5> meet the <T_8> of the long term as well <T_6> the short term : <T_7> engagement from <T_9> prisoners , longer-term engagement as well .
<T_0> last <T_3> i &apos;ll <T_1> you is <T_2> psa test .
<T_2> there is another <T_3> that <T_9> must together rebuild , <T_6> build our societies , <T_7> modern <T_0> of societies , we <T_5> at <T_8> point <T_1> we <T_4> go back .
<T_6> thought , <T_3> don &apos;t <T_5> make her <T_4> interactive mother &apos;s day card using <T_8> scratch software <T_0> i &apos;d been developing <T_7> my research group <T_2> the mit media <T_1> ?
<T_2> &apos;s super-real <T_1> it &apos;s happening <T_0> you .
but <T_0> biggest <T_2> we &apos;ve done to date , <T_9> is <T_7> amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 26-episode <T_5> series , <T_1> is done for global <T_3> : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be <T_6> the u.s. and <T_4> , we <T_8> .
so <T_0> knew at that <T_3> they could <T_2> large <T_1> .
wangari maathai <T_0> to <T_2> village <T_1> kenya .
<T_6> i <T_1> to <T_5> , it doesn &apos;t <T_2> take very <T_4> for <T_0> to find out <T_7> i &apos;m a scientist <T_3> i study sex .
<T_0> , <T_1> .
people <T_0> credit their ideas to individual &quot; eureka ! &quot; moments . but <T_9> johnson <T_7> how history <T_1> a different story . his <T_6> tour takes us <T_2> the &quot; liquid <T_3> &quot; <T_4> london &apos;s coffee houses to charles darwin &apos;s long , slow hunch <T_8> today &apos;s high-velocity <T_5> .
and of <T_0> , who <T_4> &apos;t like to take a <T_3> on <T_1> of <T_2> .
<T_2> bad , except <T_0> you look at <T_1> cover , what &apos;s missing ?
<T_2> you <T_1> the time up , because the time gives you <T_0> .
<T_2> because he &apos;s performing <T_0> behavior you &apos;ve trained <T_1> to do ?
<T_4> could talk <T_1> government data , enterprise data <T_9> really <T_5> , there &apos;s <T_6> data , there &apos;s <T_3> data , there &apos;s <T_0> data , there &apos;s data about events , there &apos;s data <T_2> talks , and there &apos;s news <T_8> there &apos;s all kinds of <T_7> .
but in <T_1> , <T_6> &apos;s something <T_4> that <T_2> &apos;ve developed in the process <T_3> developing <T_5> autonomous <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_2> involved in <T_1> interaction , <T_3> other people , <T_0> self-awareness .
anywhere between <T_3> and <T_2> percent <T_0> in adherence , just <T_1> a result of this .
and , you know , <T_4> a <T_0> is in the food <T_1> everything <T_3> affected , including <T_2> .
the <T_8> people on our blog <T_5> going to <T_6> and talk to you and <T_4> and -- <T_0> want to get <T_3> on <T_9> that <T_2> could share along with <T_7> talk.as : <T_1> .
hello <T_0> , my old <T_1> .
and then <T_2> , i obviously knew <T_1> this point , there was a <T_0> .
<T_3> have <T_1> idea what will <T_0> next with <T_2> .
<T_2> dishman : <T_1> health care <T_0> the mainframe
<T_0> you very much .
<T_6> took <T_2> out <T_5> the kennedy space <T_0> , up inside <T_1> nasa vehicle , into <T_7> back <T_3> the zero-g <T_4> .
<T_1> first <T_0> that <T_4> should be just as <T_3> with human strength <T_2> it is with <T_5> .
so , on the top , <T_3> had these beautiful rainforests <T_7> an <T_2> , and <T_5> we had all this <T_4> , we <T_6> it , which is <T_9> all the <T_1> and the valves <T_8> the water tanks and the air handlers , and all of <T_0> .
<T_2> classified <T_1> with a search <T_0> .
<T_2> increases <T_1> , <T_0> decreases .
now i have to <T_0> , these are <T_3> worst <T_2> my <T_1> has ever run .
<T_7> do you prevent either <T_4> media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the <T_0> community &apos;s interpretation of the implications of your <T_6> , <T_8> of like the <T_9> , where , &quot; <T_3> , <T_1> show that <T_5> your <T_2> .
at that point , can the <T_1> go <T_0> ?
<T_4> the second <T_1> a design <T_6> , and <T_0> &apos;s not directly <T_5> , but <T_3> &apos;s a <T_2> statement .
so at <T_4> end of my first year at harvard , a <T_7> who <T_0> not <T_2> in <T_3> the entire semester , <T_5> i had said , &quot; look , <T_6> &apos;ve gotta participate or <T_9> you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; came into <T_8> office . i really didn &apos;t know her <T_1> .
joe <T_0> : how to use a paper <T_1>
<T_3> the right-hand part <T_2> the molecule is a <T_0> bit <T_1> in every single <T_4> .
<T_2> ? chocolate ? <T_0> did that come <T_1> ?
<T_3> : i <T_0> ford has <T_1> electric vehicles coming <T_2> .
and <T_2> should be <T_0> glad <T_1> decided not to bring the <T_3> .
<T_0> care , <T_3> care , already much <T_2> employers <T_1> cars .
<T_2> the <T_1> is reached , and <T_5> frequency distribution <T_4> dramatically <T_0> and , in <T_3> , stabilizes .
<T_7> often it <T_1> just <T_5> building to <T_4> our <T_8> of what <T_6> be done , what has been done , how the world has <T_0> both in <T_2> stability and <T_3> .
<T_1> is <T_0> .
now <T_3> amazing thing <T_7> is <T_4> a ballistics <T_1> is <T_5> to <T_8> what happens to human flesh <T_0> you get <T_6> -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get <T_2> .
<T_1> were having <T_0> per capita growth .
<T_8> when <T_0> know we <T_6> to be learning to live <T_7> the <T_2> of our planet , off the power <T_9> sun , wind and <T_3> , <T_5> are <T_4> digging to get at <T_1> dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
it &apos;s starting <T_2> make sense to <T_8> -- <T_7> goes in <T_3> dough , <T_4> comes out <T_0> bread -- <T_5> it goes in <T_6> , comes out <T_1> .
so the <T_3> question that <T_0> need to think about <T_7> we <T_4> at this is <T_1> do we work <T_5> to produce global <T_2> goods , things <T_6> which all of <T_8> can <T_9> ?
i just -- <T_0> don &apos;t want to <T_2> . you <T_1> .
four hundred and fifty <T_3> of them are in <T_0> , and <T_1> million of them are in <T_2> .
thank you so <T_0> .
<T_1> were <T_4> because we <T_0> , <T_3> enough , <T_2> nation-state ways .
our <T_1> fears might <T_2> been something like this , <T_4> we <T_3> &apos;t know this was <T_0> .
<T_2> by 0.2 of a <T_4> , <T_7> &apos;s equivalently <T_1> to <T_0> robot that <T_3> tickled you <T_6> you <T_5> anything .
i <T_1> we will <T_0> another <T_2> now .
<T_2> them there &apos;s a <T_1> finish which repels <T_0> .
so <T_5> flight <T_0> conversation <T_4> really <T_3> because <T_2> can compromise our capacity <T_1> self-reflection .
he <T_1> one <T_2> after <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_2> word side of <T_0> brain .
<T_2> apparently started to <T_1> , <T_3> besides that , i think <T_5> would be <T_4> next <T_0> .
so , now <T_5> don &apos;t know where <T_2> spike <T_6> , <T_0> i <T_4> &apos;t know <T_7> it <T_3> either , <T_1> .
<T_6> while my sense of <T_4> will in <T_3> virtual <T_2> may still <T_5> limited , what <T_1> do learn <T_7> to <T_0> real life .
<T_1> is <T_2> rete . <T_3> . do <T_0> see that ?
<T_5> these <T_1> , <T_0> change their shape , <T_2> the <T_3> don &apos;t know <T_4> they &apos;re looking at <T_6> .
so <T_4> you <T_0> about it , <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> like <T_5> tourist <T_3> ourselves over there .
<T_1> mother <T_7> father had been saving money <T_0> years to be able to buy <T_2> machine , and <T_5> first <T_6> it <T_8> going to <T_4> used , even grandma was <T_9> to see <T_3> machine .
you <T_1> think <T_8> it &apos;s <T_3> hard to find <T_5> stories and new <T_2> , <T_7> new <T_0> is changing the <T_6> we <T_4> film .
<T_0> of all , you &apos;re going to hit <T_1> .
<T_2> : so , when i turned <T_0> , somebody <T_5> me outside the <T_3> and said , &quot; look <T_6> , here &apos;s a -- let me <T_4> on a <T_1> .
so <T_0> kind of flips things on its <T_2> a <T_1> .
<T_3> never had <T_2> war ; <T_4> was <T_0> peace all this <T_1> .
one of the <T_2> challenges <T_3> to <T_0> fundamentally in <T_1> .
this <T_0> a <T_2> of light <T_3> i made <T_4> a <T_1> in italy .
thank you . thank you .
and <T_1> found myself <T_7> at the paralympics and thinking how <T_4> how <T_8> &apos;s <T_9> harnessed <T_2> prove <T_6> doubt that disability <T_5> no barrier to <T_3> highest levels of sporting <T_0> .
<T_9> jim didn &apos;t <T_7> when <T_5> released that movie <T_8> that <T_3> months <T_0> nasa had <T_1> a team <T_2> assembled to develop <T_6> prototype for the <T_4> auv .
not <T_0> translate them , <T_1> interpret them .
and <T_4> we &apos;ve <T_2> down that <T_3> story <T_0> just 29 <T_6> photographs , and then we can <T_5> the <T_7> at <T_1> position .
and <T_2> you &apos;re riding along <T_0> the iss <T_1> it is right now .
this <T_1> pretty much saved <T_0> life .
<T_3> &apos;ll hear about <T_0> like , can a <T_1> game make you <T_2> ?
and then you <T_2> to <T_1> the <T_3> world <T_7> you have <T_8> detected <T_4> like this in <T_6> atmosphere of an <T_9> star somewhere in 100 <T_0> away from <T_5> .
<T_0> first one &apos;s <T_1> &quot; <T_2> lean . &quot;
anyone want to <T_0> a guess ?
and you <T_3> see <T_6> the little <T_4> is working up here <T_0> his brain and is <T_2> up the <T_5> <T_1> .
it <T_1> there within <T_0> human being .
<T_3> the things <T_6> we see <T_1> that are changing our <T_0> , we <T_7> always <T_5> back to the <T_2> of some new <T_4> .
things <T_0> scale <T_3> , <T_2> they have <T_1> up .
so <T_8> be <T_4> , <T_1> i really <T_6> suggesting here is <T_9> have a <T_3> opportunity to make <T_0> both more practical <T_2> more <T_5> , <T_7> .
it <T_4> the <T_0> example of <T_2> acquisition of <T_3> that is in the <T_1> domain .
as far <T_2> colleges go , <T_4> &apos;s about <T_0> colleges <T_1> the <T_3> teaching <T_5> game courses .
<T_0> -- <T_2> &apos;s done <T_1> up .
<T_4> would <T_2> constitute a <T_3> distraction for management of <T_1> company , especially <T_0> small eight-man shop like <T_5> company .
now the <T_1> of the <T_5> medical association gave <T_0> memoir a <T_4> clinical <T_3> , which is <T_2> unusual .
how <T_0> you <T_1> ?
this is called <T_5> collapse disorder , and <T_7> &apos;s bizarre . researchers around <T_0> globe still do <T_6> know what &apos;s causing it , <T_9> what we do know is that , with the declining numbers of bees , the costs of <T_3> 130 fruit and vegetable <T_8> so <T_4> are important for their role in the <T_1> as well as <T_2> agriculture .
<T_3> you <T_1> say , &quot; <T_4> , <T_0> designed <T_2> cow . &quot;
moreover , we <T_0> calculate a probability <T_1> the <T_3> was created in <T_2> states .
this <T_0> east asia , and <T_2> light blue <T_3> is <T_1> asia .
i mean , <T_7> a <T_8> of experts come to <T_6> and <T_5> , &quot; <T_0> are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we &apos;ve done a study of <T_1> , searle , and we &apos;re <T_4> you are <T_2> conscious , you are a very cleverly constructed <T_3> , &quot; <T_9> don &apos;t think , &quot; well , maybe these guys are right , you know ? &quot;
<T_2> there &apos;s a <T_1> watching , an actual real <T_3> watching <T_6> computer screen <T_0> which <T_5> play these <T_4> .
<T_1> the truth <T_0> i <T_2> don &apos;t have one .
come on .
<T_4> we leverage these <T_0> to <T_2> smartly whenever <T_1> travel from country <T_3> country ?
so it &apos;s happened <T_1> , and <T_8> will <T_6> in the future , <T_0> right now i can tell you that i <T_4> so , so <T_3> to <T_7> able to call pac-man <T_5> of the moma <T_2> .
i see a <T_0> of hands coming <T_1> .
<T_3> he was <T_1> , &quot; my <T_2> , <T_5> kind <T_4> a life form <T_0> that ? &quot;
<T_4> what &apos;s alarming here is <T_5> our business operating system -- <T_9> of the set of <T_6> and <T_2> beneath <T_7> businesses , how <T_0> motivate people , how <T_3> apply our human resources -- it &apos;s built entirely around these <T_1> motivators , <T_8> carrots and sticks .
this is really a change , that you have this <T_0> of more or less <T_3> , <T_1> years &apos; <T_2> on the <T_4> .
<T_4> this <T_2> an acupuncture note -- <T_5> i.m. pei &apos;s . <T_1> small ones <T_0> make the city <T_3> .
what <T_1> very <T_4> to me <T_3> tom &apos;s critique , which was , &quot; <T_2> &apos;s data <T_0> narrow . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s a fantastic <T_1> , a <T_2> object .
in <T_3> of all this <T_2> , <T_1> beginning was extremely <T_0> .
we make sure that we <T_0> our <T_1> properly .
<T_5> we be collecting <T_3> of that <T_7> &apos;s <T_0> to <T_1> his <T_6> better and to <T_2> ourselves in <T_8> he &apos;s up <T_4> no good ?
we <T_9> wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and <T_0> we <T_8> look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; fantastic ! what a <T_5> guy <T_3> is performing this <T_6> , &quot; because he would have pulled <T_7> mean of the <T_1> lower , giving us <T_2> stronger statistical results than we <T_4> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> they <T_1> to <T_0> for is what we are going to <T_3> for oil . &quot;
&quot; moon <T_0> one with <T_1> .
he <T_0> in sudan <T_2> the civil war broke out <T_1> .
<T_3> imagine , <T_7> consider this idea , if you would : what <T_0> we <T_6> connect ourselves <T_1> this <T_5> through <T_8> vast <T_2> of <T_4> and <T_9> ?
and <T_0> had no idea <T_4> i <T_2> going . <T_3> had no <T_1> .
<T_2> then <T_0> slowly build up a <T_1> of how <T_3> stuff works .
this is a <T_0> i put <T_2> a <T_1> .
<T_0> say <T_1> &apos;s nonsense .
the idea dates <T_1> 1960 , <T_5> a <T_7> astronomer by the name of <T_2> drake used this <T_6> in <T_8> virginia , pointed it at <T_4> couple of <T_0> stars in the <T_9> of <T_3> on e.t .
did <T_0> feel anything , there ?
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> new <T_2> of looking at <T_0> goods .
<T_4> was <T_0> philosopher ; he was <T_2> drum player ; <T_3> was a <T_1> par <T_5> .
and <T_0> &apos;s different <T_1> .
so <T_1> was <T_0> eight o &apos;clock at <T_2> .
<T_3> could <T_2> your <T_1> satellite and get <T_4> into space <T_0> like 8,000 dollars .
we are <T_1> to need a <T_8> generation <T_4> citizen leaders <T_6> to <T_2> ourselves <T_3> growing and <T_5> and learning <T_0> rapidly as <T_7> .
so <T_2> &apos;ve been working on this <T_0> little , also , with <T_1> couple of <T_3> guys .
<T_3> &apos;s similar <T_0> the <T_1> in mississippi <T_2> the &apos; 30s .
we had <T_1> bursting of the <T_0> .
there <T_0> is , pumping <T_1> from <T_2> feet .
and <T_3> also <T_0> to think of <T_2> as being a <T_1> grassland .
<T_7> profit is <T_1> small difference <T_0> the price <T_9> the <T_3> it takes <T_6> produce whatever <T_4> business has created <T_2> whatever problem they &apos;re <T_5> to <T_8> .
each one <T_2> more beautiful <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_4> go running across <T_1> quick as i <T_2> . <T_0> duck into hayes <T_3> .
<T_5> me , it &apos;s just <T_8> for <T_0> we &apos;re talking about : that <T_6> that creates <T_7> sense <T_4> connection <T_1> community and <T_2> is <T_3> healing .
<T_2> sound came <T_3> of my <T_7> that <T_8> &apos;d never <T_6> before : <T_1> groan , half <T_0> , <T_4> human and <T_5> terror .
<T_4> a &quot; <T_1> , &quot; do <T_3> know how <T_0> bleach ink <T_2> ?
<T_0> meet &quot; <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> , this means that <T_3> could <T_0> aging or maybe <T_1> reverse it .
<T_5> second thing <T_3> said <T_1> that , &quot; if <T_2> have interest , <T_4> education <T_0> . &quot;
<T_3> this <T_4> 5,000 <T_2> of mercury <T_1> our dental fillings alone every <T_0> .
<T_6> &apos;s performers , <T_5> rhodessa jones , <T_3> in women &apos;s prisons , <T_9> women prisoners articulate <T_4> pain of incarceration , <T_0> today &apos;s playwrights and directors work <T_2> youth gangs <T_1> find alternate <T_8> to violence and <T_7> and more and more .
and <T_0> the last <T_4> , i <T_7> to over <T_5> countries to see <T_6> and bears <T_2> elephants <T_3> tigers <T_1> rhinos .
<T_5> business model <T_3> which the <T_2> that is actually <T_6> in , <T_8> drive <T_4> car -- the minutes , the <T_7> if <T_9> want , <T_1> you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you &apos;ll pay for the <T_0> .
thank <T_0> for <T_1> attention .
so , they <T_4> the <T_0> are <T_1> windows of <T_3> soul -- <T_5> out they &apos;re a window <T_2> a <T_6> lot <T_7> stuff .
<T_2> now , <T_1> the last few <T_0> , <T_3> &apos;d been <T_4> things .
<T_1> wanted <T_0> old life back . i wanted <T_2> body <T_3> .
this <T_1> one of the <T_0> .
this <T_1> some of the <T_2> of his <T_0> .
<T_2> i thought &quot; <T_4> , if <T_0> made these ants <T_1> apartments , they &apos;ll move <T_3> . &quot;
<T_3> for the rest of your <T_0> , every time you hear <T_4> music , you &apos;ll <T_5> be able to know <T_1> you hear <T_2> impulses .
and <T_0> could make the <T_1> points about the <T_4> and <T_2> united <T_3> .
and this , to <T_1> , is a <T_0> classic <T_2> .
<T_4> if <T_3> can happen in <T_5> devils , why <T_6> &apos;t it happened <T_2> other <T_0> or even <T_1> ?
<T_0> fifth foundation <T_1> purity / sanctity .
i mean , right <T_6> , <T_5> you &apos;ve got <T_1> short <T_3> , you can drive , <T_0> can get back , you can <T_2> it at <T_4> .
then i <T_3> i had to get <T_4> smart , <T_0> would take <T_1> job in <T_2> west <T_5> .
so if <T_2> put it in <T_0> front <T_3> , your <T_1> fails .
<T_5> example , when i had <T_4> cluster of all the <T_6> talks , <T_2> thought <T_1> was <T_3> trying to find the <T_0> pick-up <T_7> .
we here <T_0> the room , i <T_5> that we <T_8> the <T_1> concern , and <T_3> model that <T_2> created in <T_6> , we <T_7> transplant <T_4> here .
taking <T_3> is <T_1> , <T_0> bubbling in a <T_5> does <T_2> stop bullets from <T_4> .
and what we <T_2> to do is reconnect <T_7> those really primal parts of <T_6> and make <T_5> decisions and <T_9> , &quot; <T_1> know , i <T_4> i <T_3> like to put cds <T_0> the <T_8> there .
<T_5> you have <T_2> there , like <T_0> alzheimer &apos;s , <T_4> can &apos;t <T_3> things including where you parked <T_1> car .
<T_1> problem &apos;s been <T_2> me <T_3> well over a <T_0> .
so , if there is <T_3> you <T_5> do <T_2> slow your aging or <T_0> , what am <T_4> doing here ? <T_1>
<T_2> gets weaker when <T_1> is <T_0> .
<T_3> i &apos;m sitting in <T_9> submersible though , i know <T_7> i &apos;m not <T_0> at all -- i &apos;ve got <T_8> lights <T_1> noisy <T_6> -- any <T_4> with any <T_5> is going to be <T_2> gone .
isn &apos;t <T_1> eating <T_0> to health ?
a <T_1> of these <T_0> had a <T_2> effect .
these same <T_2> systems are <T_0> when we &apos;re <T_4> interactions <T_1> other <T_3> .
and <T_1> wasn &apos;t a lot of <T_0> in the <T_2> .
so what we &apos;re <T_3> to do <T_1> is take our <T_2> , modify it <T_0> make the <T_4> .
<T_7> this is called blind date . it &apos;s a &#91; unclear &#93; , so <T_5> you &apos;re <T_3> shy to be really <T_1> the date , you <T_8> stay <T_9> a distance with <T_2> flowers <T_0> somebody <T_6> reenacts the <T_4> for you .
it <T_2> every <T_0> mental <T_1> .
one time <T_3> guy had <T_5> hole <T_0> his <T_4> , and that was <T_1> traumatizing <T_2> me .
<T_2> means 91 <T_4> , <T_3> after the <T_1> , still remain to be <T_0> .
i <T_0> one of <T_1> teaching gestures .
he <T_0> ultimately <T_1> , at the age <T_2> 78 , through <T_3> evidence .
<T_2> : &quot; lol <T_0> gmail <T_4> being <T_6> right now &quot; now if <T_3> think about it , <T_1> &apos;s <T_5> funny .
<T_6> &apos;s <T_3> old <T_0> in there -- a <T_4> use for <T_1> cellphones -- which dials <T_5> clinic , <T_2> go and <T_7> up the <T_8> .
i was <T_4> total <T_0> in <T_1> , not really <T_2> to graduate high <T_3> .

i mean , <T_0> the <T_7> know <T_5> start with <T_2> personality test <T_4> they start -- -- telling people all <T_1> xenu , <T_6> evil <T_3> overlord .

when jungian analyst inge <T_1> visited afghanistan , <T_0> saw the inner wounds <T_6> war -- widespread <T_7> , trauma and <T_9> . and <T_4> , in <T_5> county of 30 million people , there were <T_8> two dozen <T_2> . missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psychosocial counseling , promoting both individual and , perhaps , <T_3> healing .
and so this <T_8> emptied out her suitcase <T_7> gave all of her <T_4> to my <T_9> , <T_0> to us , and <T_3> toys of her kids , <T_2> didn &apos;t <T_6> that very much , but -- -- that <T_1> the only time <T_5> cried .

let &apos;s <T_0> it &apos;s really <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_1> people , and then <T_3> is <T_4> government <T_0> leaders .
it <T_0> that it may <T_2> always be <T_1> .
see , he <T_5> a chromium plating company , <T_8> they <T_7> to move heavy steel <T_0> between tanks of <T_6> , and <T_4> he needed <T_3> industrial robot like <T_1> that <T_9> basically do the <T_2> lifting .
<T_0> said , &quot; i <T_1> &apos;t do it .
<T_2> what we <T_3> now is this has huge <T_1> on <T_0> , <T_4> i &apos;ll talk about <T_5> .
so <T_1> way of <T_0> that is <T_3> are <T_5> the fish <T_4> drowning , and unfortunately , in <T_6> process the fish <T_2> .
he jumps <T_3> and <T_7> , of <T_4> , is the <T_2> buddha <T_8> in <T_1> beautiful <T_0> -- rainbow <T_9> , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite <T_6> vision -- that he <T_5> .
it <T_1> like <T_8> these americans are <T_9> and <T_0> , <T_3> brit , and he &apos;s not going to do <T_6> -- <T_5> thinks he &apos;s <T_4> actually , and he &apos;s actually <T_7> , i <T_2> thought about that .
clearly <T_3> obesity trend is <T_0> going <T_4> the <T_1> direction , <T_2> with huge <T_5> .
<T_3> , there is <T_2> concentration <T_1> which the sulfur <T_0> will smell like vodka .
<T_3> goes , &quot; no <T_0> gets <T_2> , read <T_1> book . &quot;
<T_0> i didn &apos;t have to <T_9> any of them really , <T_5> i just <T_7> up their jaws <T_6> it <T_8> out the biggest one had 12 <T_3> and the <T_1> smallest one had 13 <T_4> the next smallest had <T_2> .
<T_0> , we turned <T_2> the <T_1> again .
i was also an early writer , and <T_7> i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil <T_5> crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated <T_0> read , i wrote exactly the kinds <T_8> stories i was reading : <T_3> my characters were white <T_4> blue-eyed , <T_2> played <T_9> the snow , they ate apples , how lovely it <T_1> that the <T_6> had come out .
it &apos;s going to come gradually at first . it &apos;s going to <T_0> up <T_1> .
are <T_4> designing for <T_5> world that &apos;s <T_1> , <T_2> we &apos;re <T_3> or <T_0> ?
<T_6> &apos;ve been looking <T_3> for a long time , yet <T_1> they were looking for <T_5> been <T_4> there within <T_2> , right <T_0> them .
we <T_1> have a good <T_0> .
apart <T_1> the <T_5> it &apos;s won , it &apos;s portable <T_4> it &apos;s certified . <T_6> &apos;s <T_8> , the mhra -- <T_2> the ce mark , for those who don &apos;t know , for <T_9> , is the <T_7> of <T_3> fda <T_0> the u.s .
he <T_2> had the <T_0> , he had the <T_4> , <T_3> he tried to <T_1> them .
<T_1> body is <T_0> with fractals .
<T_1> i <T_3> a marker <T_2> the google earth map , i <T_7> to go with <T_6> nearest <T_5> , <T_8> is about <T_9> miles away <T_0> where <T_4> live .
for <T_2> personally , <T_9> most critical lesson <T_7> all is this : <T_8> commitment <T_1> peace <T_0> all-important , <T_4> it is often <T_6> enough to <T_5> or end <T_3> .
<T_0> both empower our promise <T_1> our peril .
we need to <T_9> that <T_3> wetlands <T_8> forests that are <T_2> best <T_7> greatest <T_4> most critical defense <T_1> global warming are protected , <T_0> we are not releasing that carbon bomb <T_6> the <T_5> .
&apos;it &apos;s <T_3> simple <T_2> , <T_0> nobody is restricting <T_1> .
so <T_0> have to also discriminate <T_1> these <T_2> .
<T_1> adult <T_0> are not embryonic stem <T_2>
very <T_2> answers . <T_0> &apos;m also wondering <T_4> , <T_1> is <T_3> ?
so , remember <T_1> sketching task we did <T_0> the beginning ?
<T_1> , got that <T_0> , didn &apos;t we ?
<T_5> because <T_3> watch mythbusters and <T_1> , i <T_2> , well , let &apos;s put in a <T_0> for a <T_4> gelatin .
they were all <T_0> glass , <T_2> that &apos;s how we <T_1> that <T_3> .
didn &apos;t <T_1> know <T_0> was <T_2> ?
pinocchio <T_0> probably one of my best <T_1> products , my favorite one .
but <T_0> are essentially <T_1> stomachs <T_2> lungs .
<T_6> i <T_2> it &apos;s a <T_7> interesting <T_9> -- what <T_3> there about the way the <T_8> is organized <T_0> might give <T_4> function to a reserve <T_5> ants who are <T_1> nothing ?
but it <T_4> &apos;t be <T_0> , <T_2> they &apos;re <T_3> going to <T_1> like this .
so this <T_6> downtown , which may <T_5> well become the <T_1> of <T_0> future <T_4> &apos; market , is <T_2> the <T_3> .
<T_6> picture is from <T_1> a few <T_0> after <T_4> baby was placed <T_3> my <T_2> and i brought <T_5> over .
thank you .
<T_2> is <T_4> all the <T_5> who <T_3> in <T_6> type of spirit are <T_1> to be on that <T_0> .
<T_0> sounds <T_3> a lot of money ; <T_1> is a lot of <T_2> .
i <T_1> , <T_0> &apos;ve <T_2> about that .
and <T_4> saying <T_8> through <T_5> , <T_6> basically <T_3> sound , <T_1> then can reach all <T_7> of <T_0> to all sorts of <T_2> .
now , since you <T_5> are really <T_4> , <T_3> you can <T_0> me and say <T_1> all <T_2> too .
we <T_0> , <T_2> 5,000 years ago , with <T_1> .
i <T_1> there , what , two <T_2> ago , <T_0> like that .
<T_3> night <T_1> stage , <T_2> actually entered my <T_0> .
<T_0> can see <T_5> curve is obviously heavily left-weighted . here &apos;s how <T_6> : if you take the top <T_4> percent <T_8> photographers <T_3> to <T_7> system , they account for three <T_2> of the photos taken -- just <T_9> top <T_1> percent most prolific photographers .
and <T_9> the <T_7> ideas <T_4> city-making start having direct influences <T_5> architecture , <T_3> the <T_8> that <T_2> up the broader <T_6> , the <T_1> themselves , and start guiding <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_3> like i can just check it <T_0> the <T_2> .
<T_3> this , <T_0> me , is <T_2> what <T_1> is .
so , any <T_1> of the kind that you see on the <T_5> , be it a real image <T_3> a synthetic <T_2> , it &apos;s <T_9> up of little regions <T_4> you see <T_6> the <T_8> column , regions of different <T_7> , different <T_0> .
it <T_1> just <T_0> story .

very <T_1> , very impossible to do , and particularly <T_2> our <T_7> , <T_9> there <T_3> is no <T_8> to actually move <T_0> train , because <T_5> fits so <T_4> into our <T_6> .
<T_0> mother &apos;s mother left <T_1> in a hurry <T_6> her <T_2> , but with <T_3> three-year-old <T_5> and <T_4> sewn into <T_7> hem of her <T_8> .
but if <T_5> is an abnormal <T_7> in the fusiform <T_6> , <T_1> may <T_4> faces , <T_8> this is exactly <T_2> you find in <T_3> of these <T_0> .
and look at <T_1> last <T_2> -- young <T_4> earning more <T_0> young <T_3> .
so <T_5> &apos;s a <T_3> series <T_8> just using <T_1> eyes , seeing <T_6> for the <T_0> time , <T_4> things afresh and using them <T_7> an opportunity <T_9> create new <T_2> .
now <T_3> &apos;s something <T_1> you <T_5> &apos;t yet <T_4> , but <T_2> think for <T_0> you are .
and <T_2> &apos;s julian <T_5> who <T_4> running it <T_3> midnight when <T_1> machine was <T_0> turned off .
<T_5> dna <T_3> in <T_0> hits <T_1> blue , doughnut-shaped structure and <T_6> &apos;s ripped apart <T_4> its two <T_2> .
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> where our story <T_0> .
up <T_3> now , <T_1> knowledge that we had about <T_0> ancestors came <T_4> from adult <T_2> because the <T_5> , the <T_6> fossils , were missing .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> way to do it .
the <T_1> was out <T_4> , it was <T_5> , it was <T_0> available , but <T_3> wanted to <T_2> .
but <T_9> point <T_3> to say , when <T_4> talk about saving <T_8> , <T_0> helping people <T_1> bangladesh in <T_6> , we &apos;re not <T_5> about <T_2> poor <T_7> .
<T_2> i <T_0> there &apos;s going to be <T_1> impacts .
and <T_0> would propose it &apos;s not a fair metric .
girl : okay .
macarthur winner <T_7> mullainathan uses <T_8> lens of behavioral <T_9> to <T_3> a tricky set of <T_1> problems -- <T_5> we know how to solve , <T_0> don &apos;t . we know how to <T_6> child deaths due to diarrhea , how to prevent diabetes-related <T_4> and how to implement solar-cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . <T_2> ?
<T_1> is <T_0> half-sister .
and i <T_4> going to tell you <T_0> answer , <T_3> obviously after <T_1> short <T_2> .
the very moment <T_2> turned it <T_1> , <T_0> hated it .

<T_0> that <T_1> .
well , so the newspaper <T_8> cambridge published <T_7> article <T_3> that &quot; <T_1> &quot; and <T_5> the next <T_6> 5,000 <T_4> from <T_9> saying , &quot; but <T_0> &apos;s simply <T_2> mandelbrot set very big . &quot;
<T_1> would be <T_0> .
<T_4> may integrate technology and <T_0> , but <T_3> starts <T_5> what <T_2> need , or <T_1> need .
in <T_1> intimate talk filmed <T_7> ted &apos;s offices , energy innovator amory <T_9> shows how to get <T_2> us off oil and coal by 2050 , $ 5 trillion cheaper , <T_8> no <T_4> of congress , led by business for <T_5> . the key <T_3> integrating all four energy-using sectors — <T_6> four kinds of <T_0> .

<T_1> we were <T_2> with <T_0> .
so <T_3> first went <T_8> copenhagen <T_2> i <T_5> , well , maybe i <T_1> become <T_6> biochemist , <T_0> i discovered <T_4> was very <T_7> .

<T_4> just asked my <T_2> one <T_0> , &quot; <T_5> do all <T_3> women love me <T_1> much ? &quot;
because <T_4> think everything <T_2> we &apos;re involved <T_0> -- our <T_6> , our <T_5> , our <T_3> , and <T_7> -- <T_8> directly a <T_1> .
<T_1> is , &quot; he said , &quot; <T_0> a female <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> about low <T_0> .

<T_0> that &apos;s <T_5> scarf <T_3> , <T_1> is also associated with <T_4> visual <T_2> .
but more importantly , <T_3> me to begin <T_2> understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , i <T_7> to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the <T_1> definition , and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is <T_5> other <T_8> , and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in , which was a community <T_4> belgium , all holocaust survivors , and in my community <T_9> were <T_0> groups : <T_6> who didn &apos;t die , and those who came back to life .
<T_1> were <T_0> people from outside .
<T_0> people <T_1> .

over <T_0> past <T_4> years , the <T_2> of <T_7> democracy <T_6> private capitalism has helped to catapult the <T_1> states and <T_3> countries <T_5> new levels of economic development .
<T_0> these <T_1> the <T_2> that we made .
the <T_0> story <T_1> starts with <T_7> as a high school <T_5> in <T_3> , <T_2> , in <T_6> tough <T_4> that everybody gave up on for dead .

and <T_0> most obviously , and <T_4> most <T_2> -- and the <T_9> to concepts that we &apos;ve heard about kind of illustrate this -- <T_5> needs infrastructure that <T_7> supply an uninterrupted source of <T_3> , of <T_6> oxygen and other medical supplies that are <T_8> critical to the functioning of this <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_3> , they <T_1> you <T_0> look <T_4> themselves , right ?
brass <T_3> tacked <T_2> the ebony wood , your <T_1> has been carved <T_0> times .

<T_4> we <T_0> to play <T_3> little piece for you <T_2> one of the <T_5> important <T_1> of america .
<T_2> , <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> reason <T_3> had a conference here at usc a <T_5> years <T_1> .
this <T_3> just <T_9> asking , again , <T_4> if we had arrived <T_5> the first <T_7> , what is <T_2> relationship of <T_8> human <T_1> to <T_0> and <T_6> ?
<T_0> , they do <T_1> in <T_2> .
<T_3> who &apos;s <T_4> england <T_0> the reputation <T_1> have from <T_2> .

he <T_0> cool . <T_2> was <T_1> .
you <T_7> , we <T_3> think that <T_4> , there are <T_0> idealized <T_9> , people are just <T_5> the <T_6> things <T_8> happened in <T_2> lives . i &apos;ve thought that <T_1> times .
so a <T_1> can put a girl <T_0> in <T_2> .
i think <T_2> &apos;re in like <T_0> , somewhere <T_1> there .
we <T_1> change <T_0> survival rates by <T_2> some <T_3> things . &quot;
so i decided instead , i would talk about someone who i think <T_5> done as much <T_3> make <T_8> happy as perhaps anyone <T_2> the last <T_7> years , a man who is a great personal hero of <T_1> : someone <T_6> the <T_9> of howard <T_0> , <T_4> is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .
<T_1> recently , i &apos;ve become <T_0> in diving <T_2> deeply into <T_3> single story <T_4>
<T_5> people <T_2> see if you &apos;re <T_3> the supermarket <T_1> and you pull out <T_4> reusable grocery <T_0> .
we <T_0> men , good <T_6> , the <T_3> majority of <T_4> , we operate <T_5> the foundation of <T_2> whole collective <T_1> .
<T_5> should study <T_8> with the <T_6> intensity <T_9> we study all the <T_2> important natural <T_1> , <T_3> global warming , <T_0> we heard so eloquently <T_7> night <T_4> al gore .
<T_5> we would apply <T_3> codes <T_9> standards <T_8> the pantheon <T_7> rome , it <T_4> never have looked like this , <T_1> this beautiful light <T_6> can only appear <T_0> there is <T_2> darkness in that same building .
<T_3> they <T_2> out into the <T_1> at the <T_0> of light .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> a step <T_3> taking responsibility <T_5> my <T_4> burden <T_2> the planet .
<T_9> the <T_4> kind tells <T_2> how to <T_6> with <T_3> we <T_0> call &quot; <T_5> self-esteem , &quot; <T_7> impolitely call &quot; feeling <T_8> bad about <T_1> . &quot;
and <T_2> &apos;ll be asked the <T_1> questions that <T_3> was asked the <T_0> few times i &apos;ve been there .
rather , when smart autos exchange electricity <T_5> information through smart buildings <T_4> smart <T_2> , they &apos;re adding <T_0> the grid <T_9> flexibility <T_8> storage that help <T_7> grid <T_6> varying solar <T_1> wind <T_3> .
so this <T_6> in <T_4> , <T_2> i was teaching many years <T_1> , <T_0> a friend of <T_3> introduced me to a young <T_5> .
<T_1> the others are <T_2> for , <T_0> &apos;ve no idea . &quot;
just <T_0> it .
and so <T_6> grand <T_2> then <T_5> to try and make sure <T_4> we <T_1> what &apos;s left , <T_0> there is <T_3> spectacular <T_7> .
<T_5> the <T_1> , there was <T_0> microlending <T_3> in the <T_2> that <T_4> her a 65-dollar loan .
<T_1> he <T_0> insane .
now <T_3> good news <T_1> , <T_2> you <T_0> get hold of .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> two-person tub .
but <T_4> last article in that <T_2> was written <T_0> francis <T_3> of dna <T_1> .
&quot; well , &quot; he <T_2> , &quot; i once <T_1> 60 in a <T_0> . &quot;
don &apos;t <T_0> for me , <T_1> .
it &apos;s <T_3> becoming <T_0> most popular high school graduation gift , given <T_2> young <T_4> who are about <T_5> go off to <T_1> .
because <T_2> teme <T_5> , <T_1> wouldn &apos;t need -- they &apos;re not <T_3> , <T_4> , oxygen-breathing , warmth-requiring <T_0> .
and the work <T_2> have been doing was completely <T_0> to <T_3> and to <T_1> it .
because <T_2> the <T_1> was <T_0> able to reach these areas .
the <T_0> .
<T_1> anybody <T_0> on antidepressants ?
<T_1> &apos;ll take that <T_0> my <T_2> legacy .
here is <T_3> the <T_6> is , <T_1> i &apos;ll <T_2> to you <T_5> well as <T_4> can <T_0> the problem is .
and i &apos;m going to share my music with you , <T_1> i hope that i &apos;m going to do so in a way that tells a story , tells <T_3> story about how i used boredom as a <T_6> for creativity and invention , <T_4> how boredom actually forced <T_2> to <T_7> the <T_9> question <T_5> i was asking in my discipline , and <T_0> boredom also , in a sense , pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort <T_8> most traditional , narrow definition of a composer .
if you &apos;re in <T_2> , you <T_0> use a rice husk <T_1> a cottonseed hull .
we have some <T_1> data where they <T_0> across <T_2> .
<T_1> will <T_0> this day .
<T_1> that <T_3> on <T_2> for solutions , for <T_5> , <T_0> than imposing <T_4> on nature .
let <T_0> explain <T_1> that <T_2> .
no <T_2> education , <T_0> very <T_1> .
but <T_4> &apos;ve got to <T_1> you , we <T_3> guys , we looked <T_2> to <T_0> dude , man .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_1> example <T_2> how comparing to <T_3> past can <T_0> our decisions .
<T_3> don &apos;t get any <T_2> , they don &apos;t get <T_1> value for what <T_0> spend .
this <T_3> the $ <T_8> dollar o-gram , and <T_1> image <T_7> out <T_5> frustration <T_6> had with <T_2> reporting of billion-dollar <T_0> in <T_4> press .
<T_3> has <T_0> this focus <T_4> security made <T_2> feel <T_1> much more insecure ?
we treat <T_3> with symptom-modifying <T_7> -- <T_1> -- <T_2> are , <T_4> , <T_6> very effective <T_5> this kind <T_0> pain .
<T_2> story does not <T_1> to <T_0> something .
blood test results <T_1> this great <T_0> .
<T_6> third one i <T_4> to talk about <T_5> is the progression <T_9> , where <T_2> have to <T_0> of make progress , <T_7> have to move through different <T_1> in <T_8> very <T_3> fashion .
one <T_0> you &apos;ve <T_2> to have a <T_1> idea .
and this is , of <T_3> , <T_4> the <T_2> time <T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> recognized this .
<T_7> , <T_1> healthcare system has been <T_6> : <T_4> culture <T_2> with defensiveness , universal <T_0> of <T_8> system of justice , universal <T_5> of defensive <T_3> .
<T_0> would feel <T_1> abdomen .
and <T_0> she looked at <T_1> .
but then , <T_0> has <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s hard <T_2> study a bluefin <T_3> its turf , <T_1> entire <T_4> .
<T_1> i didn &apos;t like the way -- the instruction i got was very <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> woman . <T_3> can <T_0> the hair .
<T_1> we do <T_0> research on <T_2> topic ?
that &apos;s what <T_3> future has got to be , <T_0> putting it in the public <T_1> is <T_2> .
<T_3> they <T_2> explode before your <T_1> or <T_0> down supersonic .
<T_3> so if you &apos;re <T_1> for growth <T_5> to get into , that &apos;s <T_0> a good one -- <T_7> natural <T_4> . <T_9> population <T_2> going up ; it &apos;s going <T_6> continue for quite a <T_8> .
and <T_3> reason <T_0> was , was that <T_2> is a cold <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> longer <T_0> solid , a liquid <T_2> a gas .
the reason <T_3> &apos;s different is that , just in <T_1> past <T_6> years , our <T_8> have started demonstrating <T_2> they have never , ever <T_0> before : understanding , speaking , hearing , <T_7> , answering , <T_5> , <T_9> they &apos;re <T_4> acquiring new skills .
in <T_1> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> that tomorrow can <T_3> than <T_5> and going <T_0> that .
so <T_0> get immune to <T_2> that scare <T_1> after awhile .
so this means <T_2> in <T_4> place with a <T_5> of aids , there &apos;s a <T_1> significant <T_0> of <T_3> .
<T_0> it has the <T_2> to override our <T_1> .
so it <T_1> up a <T_0> new <T_3> , and these <T_4> saw <T_2> .
we &apos;ve been <T_0> by our <T_1> .
he <T_5> the quiz show &quot; <T_0> ! &quot; <T_2> times in a <T_3> , <T_4> home three <T_1> dollars .
and i would say that we live <T_4> a country -- five percent of <T_5> world &apos;s population , <T_0> percent of <T_3> greenhouse gases , but <T_1> 25 <T_6> of the <T_2> &apos;s prisoners .
that &apos;s kind of a mistake together .
<T_2> what &apos;s been taking up the <T_3> in <T_1> last <T_0> decades ?
this <T_0> a program written in <T_2> particular <T_1> .
<T_0> says , &quot; i &apos;ve found it on <T_1> . keep , keep , <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> way that is <T_1> more real , more <T_0> .
<T_0> , <T_2> man <T_4> enough to <T_3> that he knows <T_1> .
when <T_4> was in high <T_3> , i got <T_1> first <T_5> reel-to-reel tape recorder , and tape recorders <T_0> my sort of pre-computer medium <T_2> learning .
<T_0> far , this <T_1> looks very smooth , like that .
but <T_1> graph is after taking into account <T_2> of these <T_0> risk factors .
<T_0> there might be <T_8> changes in store that you <T_4> not <T_1> . <T_7> example , <T_6> require more runway for takeoff <T_3> the <T_2> , less dense <T_9> , provides for less <T_5> .
<T_3> there is still <T_1> to be done <T_0> end the <T_4> institutionalization <T_2> children .
<T_1> keep trying <T_0> make it <T_2> .
<T_6> to be <T_1> within the confines <T_0> our limitations is the <T_7> hope <T_2> have to transform <T_3> and , <T_4> , transform our <T_5> .
<T_9> that with the <T_2> released just <T_0> ago that &apos;s now <T_5> into something the size of a key fob , and if you take a <T_7> at the state <T_3> the art for a complete gps receiver , which is only a <T_4> on a side and more sensitive than ever , you realize <T_1> the gps dot will soon move <T_8> to <T_6> .
art <T_0> create an <T_1> .
so in these <T_0> , the <T_9> are <T_3> statistics to <T_7> out about the <T_8> , <T_2> after all , scientists <T_5> do experiments , and <T_1> wanted to <T_4> if children are doing <T_6> .
then they had <T_0> hang the clothes out <T_1> dry .
i literally <T_0> up with <T_2> ford <T_1> company .
and so <T_0> finally ended up making <T_1> .
so , he played <T_7> hyderabad , went , straight <T_6> the <T_4> , went <T_1> the stadium to <T_5> airport , sat <T_9> a <T_8> -- first <T_0> in <T_3> , second refueling in brazil ; he was <T_2> west indies in time .
and <T_1> did <T_0> discover ?
it doesn &apos;t make <T_2> word <T_1> more real <T_3> any <T_0> way .
<T_0> maccready : the <T_1> could touch <T_2> on top and <T_4> break . we <T_3> .
<T_0> is a picture of <T_2> pursat looks <T_1> .
they <T_4> these seaweed-based snacks there <T_2> veggie booty <T_0> kale , which is <T_5> kids <T_1> come <T_6> and <T_9> , &quot; mom , <T_8> , i <T_7> a <T_3> that &apos;ll help prevent colon-rectal cancer . &quot;
something <T_0> happened <T_2> this <T_1> .
and i <T_6> driving <T_8> from work , and <T_9> truck was coming <T_1> opposite direction , <T_5> over into <T_0> lane , <T_7> over the top of my <T_3> and <T_2> axle tore my <T_4> off .
just <T_0> , warming <T_1> -- king of hearts .
<T_1> mr. ross said , &quot; <T_5> &apos;re <T_8> smart to die <T_2> i don &apos;t <T_0> it on <T_3> conscience , <T_9> i &apos;m leaving <T_6> school <T_7> i &apos;m taking <T_4> with me . &quot;
<T_0> is part of the amazon basin , <T_3> place <T_1> rondônia <T_4> the south-center <T_2> of the <T_5> amazon .
and i <T_4> that &apos;s much <T_1> , that kind <T_0> control <T_3> be much <T_5> as <T_2> drug .
he started <T_2> a boy <T_4> of the children &apos;s orchestra <T_0> his <T_3> , <T_1> .
<T_6> of the <T_1> the <T_5> gave for <T_4> me against my <T_0> was that i <T_3> &quot; <T_2> disabled . &quot;
we <T_1> now <T_2> for nearly all <T_4> the tens <T_5> conditions that a <T_3> being <T_0> have .
well , i do think <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> good <T_3> for <T_1> .
and <T_5> go <T_1> closely <T_7> , and you <T_3> see that <T_4> similarity with <T_0> and china , in many ways , are <T_6> than <T_2> differences with them .
and the <T_1> words <T_2> said to his <T_4> were , &quot; <T_0> &apos;t <T_3> for me , <T_5> .
<T_3> want to look at <T_1> blood vessels . i want to <T_0> at <T_2> liver .
and <T_0> don &apos;t invest <T_2> what &apos;s invisible <T_1> us .
<T_3> unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these <T_1> complicated <T_5> that <T_0> give them <T_4> conditional probability <T_2> .
<T_1> each <T_2> itself <T_0> largely unique .
so , <T_2> are <T_1> a little bit more <T_3> than the <T_0> structures .
to make <T_1> , we <T_0> to break the <T_2> .
<T_3> i <T_2> it &apos;s important <T_0> have <T_1> places .
<T_1> what i <T_4> from <T_0> brazilian <T_3> is <T_2> this guy is just a cliche machine .
what we want is to embrace <T_8> world and bring <T_0> into our laboratory , <T_6> in order for <T_9> to <T_3> that , we had to <T_7> these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , <T_5> little <T_2> , how newborns , engage with the world , moment <T_4> moment , what is important , and <T_1> is not .
<T_2> , how did i come <T_1> this <T_3> position of <T_0> ?
i <T_1> give you a <T_0> of flip , this , that , and the other .
and what <T_3> &apos;re looking for <T_7> the <T_4> dimming <T_6> light that is <T_2> by a planet passing in front of one of <T_1> stars <T_5> blocking <T_0> of that starlight from getting to us .
the man on <T_3> can <T_2> , <T_1> blind man can <T_0> .
and <T_4> announced , &quot; <T_7> , <T_3> , <T_5> &apos;s <T_1> here , <T_6> this autonomous <T_2> we &apos;re going to <T_0> of processes . &quot;
now i want <T_1> imagine for <T_0> second an <T_4> boy <T_5> graduates from high school in <T_6> city <T_2> missouri <T_3>
<T_1> , <T_0> already saw anecdotally a <T_3> of signs that <T_2> might .
<T_3> conducted <T_2> first phase three randomized trial in <T_1> with <T_0> gbm .
so again we persisted , and <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> came to <T_2> party and gave <T_0> our first <T_9> sponsorship , and that <T_6> enough for me <T_5> quit <T_4> job , <T_8> did <T_7> on the side .
so , to make <T_5> really <T_2> very important <T_3> , <T_0> would <T_1> even <T_4> have to change and have to finally <T_7> that <T_6> is what made us .
<T_0> we don &apos;t really know for sure .
it <T_1> all about going for <T_0> center .
what i <T_2> is a <T_4> in <T_0> next 20 <T_3> , <T_1> enough to protect me .
<T_1> were allowed <T_0> return to jerusalem and to rebuild <T_2> temple .
<T_2> can keep <T_0> palin &apos;s daughter <T_1> .
this <T_0> the bacterial <T_1> .
<T_1> mates were <T_0> for them .
<T_1> playstation <T_3> is <T_4> the works , <T_0> for <T_5> next <T_2> i &apos;ll bring it .
our <T_0> are <T_3> ethical or unethical <T_1> that they &apos;re using ethical or unethical <T_4> of <T_2> us .
<T_2> &apos;m sniffing <T_3> other dog &apos;s rear end , <T_0> owner &apos;s <T_1> . &quot;
<T_0> all begins <T_1> enjoyment .
and <T_5> said , &quot; <T_1> , girls , <T_6> is <T_2> very <T_4> journalist , <T_3> just wouldn &apos;t do at <T_0> . &quot;
and <T_0> 10 <T_1> years , <T_5> might even have <T_4> time <T_2> play <T_3> few more games .
be very <T_1> of the <T_0> .
and <T_5> comes the <T_1> into it , because <T_0> this <T_6> way of communicating <T_3> these kids <T_4> communicate with each other <T_7> the <T_2> .
<T_2> this <T_0> what <T_1> me see it .
we <T_1> put an <T_0> date on all <T_2> childhood <T_3> .
<T_0> were <T_1> going to go , <T_2> were <T_3> going to go .
<T_9> doing that , <T_0> think , <T_7> the <T_1> to the future <T_2> it &apos;s not <T_3> scaling a new solution ; it &apos;s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , <T_5> with <T_8> support based <T_4> a personalized <T_6> .
<T_4> the <T_5> of the spider , it <T_6> sending <T_1> insane , <T_0> i <T_3> &apos;t get the web <T_2> move off .
the <T_0> was <T_8> , that <T_4> and psychiatrists became victimologists , <T_1> , <T_5> our view <T_2> human <T_9> was that if <T_7> were in <T_6> , bricks <T_3> on you .
<T_5> can send <T_6> to the <T_4> ; we <T_2> see <T_8> there &apos;s life on <T_7> -- why <T_3> &apos;t we get five-dollar <T_0> to 500 <T_1> people ?
this is a <T_8> interesting trend , <T_9> we used to live in <T_6> world <T_2> everyone &apos;s said glibly , &quot; form follows function , &quot; but i think i &apos;ve sort of grown up in <T_7> world -- <T_3> listened to neil gershenfeld yesterday ; <T_1> was <T_0> a lab <T_5> with his -- where it &apos;s really <T_4> world where information defines form and function .
i now <T_2> that it wasn &apos;t until i let go of <T_1> i thought i was that <T_3> was able to create a completely <T_0> life .
and <T_4> hope <T_1> you <T_0> it and i <T_2> you tell <T_3> about it one <T_5> .
we &apos;ve got <T_2> post-op patient years between us , <T_1> we <T_3> &apos;t had a single <T_0> .
so <T_3> &apos;s <T_0> few elements , <T_2> social <T_1> and some <T_4> of the <T_5> .
this <T_3> some of <T_5> research <T_0> you &apos;re going to <T_2> that <T_4> &apos;re <T_6> at the <T_1> .
<T_2> to &quot; five <T_1> things <T_3> should let your children <T_0> . &quot;
<T_3> are <T_2> naming <T_0> , <T_4> they won &apos;t use their <T_1> names .
<T_2> have many <T_1> that we &apos;re working on , but <T_3> of them are <T_0> basic .
he &apos;s a <T_0> little <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s looking at <T_2> seams . <T_3> &apos;s looking <T_1> the <T_4> .
now , the interesting <T_6> comes <T_2> more <T_4> when anthropologists began taking this game <T_9> other <T_1> and discovered , to their <T_7> , that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic <T_0> in central asia or a dozen <T_5> cultures -- each had <T_8> different <T_3> of what is fair .
and that &apos;s a problem , because <T_0> have to make it <T_8> important a job , because it &apos;s the <T_4> job in the world to <T_2> inside the <T_6> , for <T_5> of both <T_7> , <T_1> we &apos;re going to even <T_9> out and let women stay in the <T_3> .
<T_6> , because <T_2> still <T_9> , <T_3> &apos;s a democratic <T_7> in <T_5> you say &quot; well , <T_1> you give us what &#91; we <T_4> &#93; , we &apos;ll <T_0> you <T_8> . &quot;
and <T_0> beauty of this <T_4> that you <T_5> &apos;t <T_2> to form briquettes -- it comes ready made . this is <T_6> $ <T_3> laptop , <T_1> here .
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east , i have never been as optimistic <T_4> i am today that the <T_2> between the muslim <T_6> and the west is narrowing <T_9> , and one of the <T_3> reasons for my optimism is that , because i know there are <T_0> , hundreds of millions of people , muslims like <T_1> old <T_8> in <T_5> , who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original , beautiful <T_7> .
<T_3> me <T_4> back and take a <T_2> at <T_1> the city is <T_5> good for the <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_1> very large <T_0> that doesn &apos;t <T_4> to be <T_2> to <T_3> in particular .
so she <T_1> to give 10 <T_5> of the <T_6> -- of the <T_3> value , <T_2> about <T_4> dollars in <T_0> .
<T_3> : <T_1> &apos;s going <T_0> . <T_2> shit .
<T_2> have <T_3> three <T_1> who have been trained <T_0> cook .
&quot; <T_4> , <T_0> , &quot; i &apos;ll <T_2> her , don &apos;t keep your <T_1> up in <T_3> air like that .
and <T_1> we revert the cancer <T_0> , <T_2> again does <T_3> .
<T_3> you &apos;re <T_0> measuring things , <T_2> don &apos;t <T_4> and <T_1> don &apos;t know .
&quot; <T_1> than <T_0> can suppose . &quot;
<T_3> for <T_4> , it &apos;s been great <T_2> it &apos;s won <T_1> of design <T_0> .
<T_1> many <T_0> him ? <T_2> ?
now that &apos;s a magnificent piece of art .
take <T_0> apart with <T_3> kid , or <T_4> him to <T_2> school <T_6> we &apos;ll <T_1> it apart <T_5> them .
so <T_1> megabyte , <T_4> million <T_0> is 26 <T_2> -- it goes mega- , giga- , tera- . <T_3> terabytes .
<T_8> majority of <T_3> planet , <T_2> for <T_5> , having <T_0> right <T_6> development , are <T_4> large aspiring for an unsustainable <T_1> , a <T_7> pressure .
he &apos;s got <T_0> arms .
<T_4> &apos;d spoken in somalia , <T_2> , gaza , the west bank , <T_9> , sri lanka , congo , <T_8> it <T_5> , and they &apos;d all <T_6> me , &quot; <T_7> you can create a <T_1> of opportunity , <T_3> can move aid , we can vaccinate <T_0> .
<T_1> we have these <T_0> .
<T_6> did <T_3> because <T_7> couldn &apos;t <T_1> a car , <T_2> also <T_4> he <T_0> how to <T_5> one .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_0> made of ? <T_3> are <T_1> made of , mom ?
<T_5> i absorbed a <T_3> from these <T_0> of wisdom , and before i went back into the <T_4> that <T_1> , i <T_9> down three <T_2> of my own <T_6> i bring to my <T_7> planning still <T_8> .
so here <T_2> a complete <T_0> of the <T_3> about 14-odd billion <T_1> ago .
you &apos;ve got <T_3> up <T_5> who is <T_1> operative <T_6> of doing that for <T_0> whole <T_4> . <T_2> ?
this <T_0> on for <T_1> .
ji-hae park : the <T_1> , <T_3> my <T_2> night of the <T_0>
<T_0> don &apos;t need it . you just need the social-psychological <T_1> .
<T_3> might think <T_0> those <T_4> than us , those who are born into <T_1> , will <T_2> more naturally .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> i &apos;m getting paid for this ?
<T_3> a <T_4> came <T_2> to me and <T_0> me <T_1> piece of paper .
<T_3> queen just <T_0> the <T_1> . there &apos;s no <T_2> .
<T_3> , to address this , our <T_1> program is focused around <T_2> meta-themes , or <T_0> .
<T_7> unit takes <T_3> message -- <T_5> negative <T_1> -- it <T_8> to that , checks <T_4> it <T_2> there and then <T_0> it to <T_6> neighbor .
<T_4> was going to <T_3> it , but <T_2> thought <T_1> &apos;d get costa to <T_5> it , my lovely <T_0> .
so in <T_0> at that , i also realized that <T_2> was really <T_1> .
you <T_0> i &apos;ve lost <T_5> way , and somebody &apos;s going <T_6> come on <T_2> stage in a <T_3> and guide <T_1> gently back <T_4> my seat .
<T_1> mean , if <T_2> hadn &apos;t worked <T_4> me , there &apos;s <T_3> way i would have <T_0> it was <T_5> .
<T_1> skyrocketing demand <T_3> food means that <T_6> has become the <T_0> driver of climate change , biodiversity <T_7> and environmental destruction . at tedxtc jonathan <T_5> shows why we desperately need to <T_4> &quot; terraculture &quot; -- <T_9> for <T_2> whole <T_8> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
<T_3> he <T_0> on rambling about <T_2> and styles <T_4> nuyorican friday <T_1> .
<T_4> we <T_6> this new <T_2> pattern , we can <T_1> a <T_3> of <T_5> where particles seem to be <T_0> .
<T_2> is <T_6> thermodynamic <T_3> that produces electricity , <T_0> this makes this <T_5> 50 percent <T_4> , <T_7> 45 <T_1> 50 percent efficiency .
<T_2> if <T_6> did this for <T_0> thousand <T_5> , <T_1> would get from 2.3 million <T_3> down <T_4> 6,000 .
<T_3> &apos;d think <T_1> &apos;d be <T_0> about staying <T_2> .
and <T_1> same thing is happening <T_0> eyes .
<T_0> and <T_1> , <T_2> instance , <T_4> really opened the <T_3> &apos;s mind .
it <T_0> questions .
there <T_8> to be <T_6> kind of spring-loaded <T_9> in <T_2> to <T_1> the amount <T_0> force that we <T_5> , and <T_4> speed <T_3> we observe , and the output of <T_7> system .
<T_4> many <T_6> worldwide who are <T_2> or are facing <T_5> due to <T_9> of the <T_8> , <T_1> like macular degeneration , and <T_7> &apos;s little <T_3> can be done for <T_0> .
so that when <T_4> think about using them <T_7> get some systematic <T_2> , we <T_0> think about <T_3> they <T_1> be <T_5> for self-improvement , <T_6> self-discovery , self-awareness , self-knowledge .
<T_0> the <T_2> , <T_4> experience <T_1> person &apos;s touch in your <T_3> .
<T_2> at <T_4> for me , personally , <T_3> trees have taught me an <T_5> new <T_0> of loving <T_1> children .
<T_0> if there was <T_3> for them to <T_5> , the <T_1> pieces eventually got <T_4> and <T_2> away .
<T_6> we &apos;re <T_3> done yet . <T_4> then how do <T_0> go from stage <T_2> , which is <T_5> , <T_1> stage <T_7> ?
<T_2> is <T_0> pretty involved <T_4> ; it took <T_3> about four and a <T_1> years .
<T_3> are doing <T_2> on a <T_5> of the <T_4> that <T_0> used typically in &#91; the &#93; western <T_7> -- <T_6> quarter of the <T_1> .
and <T_8> we &apos;re looking out , kind <T_3> a surreal moment before the first stroke , standing on the <T_0> at marina hemingway , the <T_6> is flying above , all <T_2> team &apos;s out in their boats <T_9> <T_5> up in the air , &quot; we &apos;re here , we &apos;re here <T_4> you , &quot; bonnie and i look at each other , and we say , this year , the mantra is -- and i &apos;ve been using it in <T_1> -- find a <T_7> .
this <T_0> lives in the <T_1> in chile <T_2> and it happens <T_3> be 3,000 years <T_4> .
which one did you <T_1> ? <T_0> first one .
but <T_0> are still some <T_1> traits .
<T_0> can &apos;t <T_1> to anything . &quot;
my <T_3> body <T_0> in one direction , my <T_2> flew in <T_4> <T_1> .
<T_1> package , <T_2> cents a <T_3> -- their <T_0> is overcome .
<T_4> what <T_6> felt <T_5> the child at <T_8> moment <T_2> deep affection , but <T_7> like <T_0> i feel for him <T_3> , five <T_1> later .
it was <T_6> family , a <T_8> , father , <T_5> , walking down <T_4> aisle , talking <T_0> the <T_9> . now <T_3> a <T_2> eastern male , i know <T_7> &apos;s certain things i &apos;m not supposed to say on an airplane <T_1> the u.s. , right ?
and this , of <T_2> , <T_0> in the iran-contra scandal of <T_1> 1980s .
now , <T_2> use my <T_0> to reach <T_3> &apos;s hearts and have found <T_4> are no <T_1> .
some of <T_1> ideas are really <T_2> and <T_3> of them are <T_0> .
the <T_3> that <T_1> see , though , is <T_2> and then <T_0> access .
<T_8> changes <T_1> showed you are impressive <T_0> me <T_9> of what they tell us about <T_5> function of <T_7> brain , but <T_6> &apos;re small <T_2> the scale of the <T_4> judgments <T_3> we actually make .
in <T_2> of them , one of <T_7> kids once said , &quot; <T_0> we were riding on <T_3> ridge overlooking <T_9> dead <T_6> -- and he &apos;s <T_8> about this spot here -- &quot; i was reminded <T_1> the <T_5> when i left my village in ethiopia and went away together with <T_4> brother .
well , i <T_0> &apos;t recommend that you try to do <T_1> now .
so <T_0> does <T_1> work ?
they <T_0> it on a <T_1> board .
when <T_5> comes to <T_6> and <T_1> for <T_0> i am <T_4> , <T_8> mean , <T_7> , lemon squeezer , toilet brush , toothpick , beautiful toilet seats , and why <T_3> -- a <T_2> ?
and what <T_7> see is -- actually , the red <T_4> line <T_0> the <T_8> of this performing <T_2> , which was a <T_5> piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was <T_6> robotic drill , basically , that went all <T_1> way around , cruised the museum , went all around <T_3> walls <T_9> did a lot of damage .
<T_0> clamshell &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_2> each point of <T_0> spots , <T_3> had <T_1> a tree .
in <T_2> , <T_3> workers <T_0> retiree in <T_1> u.s .
so <T_0> you put <T_1> .
so , thank <T_2> . another <T_0> , <T_1> card .
<T_0> so <T_4> , there are <T_2> when <T_3> can <T_1> ingredients that &#91; are &#93; <T_5> .
<T_2> other thing we <T_4> is that <T_1> doesn &apos;t <T_5> so much <T_3> your energy source <T_0> free .
and we <T_5> for eight hours along <T_8> moonscape-like <T_0> with very little <T_2> , lots of <T_7> , <T_4> little <T_1> , <T_3> we <T_6> exhausted .
<T_5> , <T_3> we <T_7> to think about <T_2> , what <T_4> a goal for development , <T_6> what <T_1> the means for <T_0> ?
a <T_1> had good <T_0> .
and <T_2> &apos;s through <T_4> sharing <T_6> people get <T_7> of how <T_1> take care of themselves , how <T_0> disclose how <T_3> take <T_5> .
<T_0> was a <T_6> master-level <T_3> connection , because what <T_5> was really <T_2> here was , <T_4> trust <T_1> this <T_7> .
now <T_3> men <T_2> about women &apos;s rights <T_1> to the <T_0> of this <T_4> .
and <T_4> we &apos;re <T_2> , in <T_0> , <T_3> we &apos;re teaching <T_7> dog , kind of like -- <T_5> &apos;re letting the dog <T_1> that the <T_6> is training <T_8> .
i <T_4> that <T_2> of <T_0> want <T_3> be accessories after the fact in a global supply <T_1> .
<T_0> , <T_4> standard who <T_2> , reaches from <T_3> to 60 <T_1> reliability .
you basically need <T_5> , you need an <T_2> to <T_7> and focus , to communicate <T_6> , and to operate in <T_0> workplace that is <T_4> more fluid than <T_8> used to be , and those are things <T_9> women do extremely <T_1> , <T_3> we &apos;re seeing .
<T_1> , <T_2> you &apos;re from new <T_0> .
<T_0> we thought , <T_1> not ? let &apos;s do it .
and <T_2> a way , i kind of like <T_0> sensation of it a <T_5> better <T_8> i <T_4> actually standing <T_7> top of the <T_1> , wondering <T_3> to <T_6> .
so <T_2> we think about <T_4> technologies , <T_0> actually think of using <T_1> and <T_3> , <T_5> organisms .
<T_2> right , <T_0> is <T_1> technology that <T_5> put together using some <T_6> the <T_4> we &apos;re <T_3> in .
now <T_1> being a <T_6> company , we could do certain things , we <T_4> certain <T_5> , that i <T_2> that a pharmaceutical <T_0> doesn &apos;t <T_3> .
<T_2> ugly tom <T_1> around , tom was <T_0> .
and <T_0> next <T_2> here is one of <T_1> lunchrooms .
our <T_1> are being <T_2> for <T_0> american <T_4> , builder , <T_3> , maker .
<T_0> don &apos;t catch <T_2> in <T_1> net .
<T_4> in fact , if <T_3> is what coding <T_7> like , <T_8> will only be <T_5> narrow sub-community <T_0> people <T_9> special <T_2> skills and <T_1> background that <T_6> code .
jessica <T_1> never planned <T_0> shooting back .
i come <T_1> also look at <T_3> as this <T_7> that <T_2> have as <T_4> , <T_0> fear that just has <T_5> paralyzed , holding <T_6> hostage to <T_8> man box .
<T_2> go to chez <T_1> , they <T_4> you <T_0> red-tail sashimi with roasted <T_5> seeds <T_3> a something something <T_6> .
<T_0> can <T_1> the folding <T_4> again to produce <T_3> shape , or <T_2> shape .
<T_5> out the people who tried <T_9> recall the ten commandments -- and in our <T_1> nobody could recall <T_8> of the ten commandments -- <T_2> those people <T_4> tried to <T_6> the ten commandments , <T_3> the opportunity <T_0> cheat , did <T_7> cheat at all .
and <T_0> just takes <T_2> quick , quick <T_1> .
<T_3> if <T_5> take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , <T_0> advanced <T_1> , very advanced <T_7> -- so <T_9> &apos;re pouring chemicals in one end , ipods are spewing out <T_6> other -- and really <T_4> design , <T_8> &apos;s <T_2> we wanted to do .
<T_4> if <T_5> look closely at <T_0> beetle &apos;s <T_2> , there are <T_3> of little bumps <T_1> that shell .
<T_5> a <T_1> investigation , went down <T_2> washington , <T_3> them i <T_6> think they &apos;re <T_0> but we &apos;re going to do <T_4> .
<T_1> trust <T_0> ears .
<T_0> &apos;s hard <T_1> do high-rise .
and <T_4> &apos;ve also added <T_2> this diagram now <T_3> pink lines <T_1> go <T_0> and to the <T_5> .
then <T_1> saturday we went to <T_3> village to visit , and <T_4> mother <T_6> us a <T_2> patterned basket <T_0> dyed raffia <T_5> his <T_7> had <T_8> .
<T_1> i talk <T_5> that , i &apos;ve written down at the <T_2> there the <T_4> of this <T_0> , <T_3> straight <T_6> .
<T_1> said , &quot; <T_2> happened <T_0> the <T_3> ? &quot;
<T_3> . and <T_1> &apos;s going to be different <T_0> people <T_2> .
<T_1> did you go <T_2> shopping ? <T_0> went <T_5> your <T_3> , what a <T_4> social time .
<T_1> can <T_0> , or it can inhibit actually , signals .
<T_1> to you , <T_0> .
<T_3> it &apos;s libya , <T_5> , syria , it &apos;s <T_0> our galleries <T_2> we can <T_1> and give greater <T_4> .
and <T_4> leaders , their leaders : <T_2> they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and <T_9> know <T_0> reason -- before they send them off , they go <T_1> a christian <T_3> , and they <T_6> to <T_8> christian <T_5> , and they <T_7> for protection and guidance from that god .
<T_6> prime food <T_5> are depleted , the harvest <T_1> deeper <T_4> the oceans <T_2> brings in more <T_0> sources of <T_3> .
and today , i will use <T_5> , <T_4> earliest <T_1> ever <T_2> , to <T_0> you a story of all of <T_3> .
perhaps <T_2> art is <T_6> only their <T_7> can bear , and because <T_9> practice such art <T_3> day <T_1> , <T_8> honestly <T_4> a <T_0> tired <T_5> kids .
and <T_0> is <T_1> amazing <T_2> for me as well .
this <T_1> soft structural method enables me <T_4> model these <T_5> build these <T_2> at <T_0> scale <T_3> skyscrapers .
so a <T_6> weeks after <T_4> diagnosis , we went up <T_2> vermont , and <T_1> decided to put jeff <T_5> the first person <T_0> the <T_7> of <T_3> .
<T_0> i <T_2> saw her , <T_4> thought she <T_5> be dead in <T_3> matter of <T_1> .
i &apos;ll <T_2> all <T_0> shoes <T_1> .
and &quot; <T_7> &quot; <T_5> a really <T_1> word because <T_2> think it <T_6> means neat , <T_3> it also <T_0> -- <T_4> making <T_8> remark about .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_5> complicated , <T_3> it <T_0> out <T_2> flap their <T_1> very quickly .
<T_2> need a <T_0> on those <T_1> categories .
<T_5> blog post , each blog <T_6> may <T_8> , <T_1> and of itself , be exactly what <T_4> &apos;re looking for , <T_9> collectively the <T_0> of those people posting , those people linking , more often <T_7> not is going to <T_2> you a very interesting <T_3> enormously valuable picture of what &apos;s going on .
and <T_1> plot <T_5> thickens when <T_4> realize <T_8> , <T_6> other pleistocene tools , the <T_3> often exhibit <T_0> evidence of <T_7> on their <T_2> edges .
<T_2> are not <T_0> at <T_1> with uncertainty .
<T_0> she elected <T_1> undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in <T_2> .
<T_1> remember , be nice <T_0> nerds .
and in some ways , it &apos;s <T_3> of back to <T_0> kind of old idea <T_1> centralized <T_2> .
and he &apos;d show up obviously in <T_9> form <T_1> it took me a long time to <T_7> , which is that <T_8> we give <T_3> the <T_6> what <T_4> want the <T_0> , we <T_5> the broken <T_2> inside each of us .
<T_1> saw <T_4> guy <T_3> the side of the road , and <T_0> actually doesn &apos;t have a <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> my <T_1> , <T_0> it &apos;s okay .
<T_4> few months <T_1> , <T_5> country of <T_0> decided that all of <T_3> first graders should <T_2> to code .
and of <T_1> it &apos;s growing <T_0> fast , <T_3> there &apos;s growing <T_2> .
well , this <T_3> &quot; the purpose driven <T_2> &quot; -- &quot; the bible <T_4> become the authoritative standard <T_6> my <T_9> , the compass <T_7> rely on for direction , the <T_0> i <T_8> to for making wise decisions <T_1> the benchmark <T_5> use for evaluating everything . &quot;
<T_3> &apos;s a <T_0> called &quot; <T_2> . &quot; it &apos;s 180 pages <T_1> water .
so <T_1> was like , okay , so <T_0> &apos;ve got <T_2> formula ready .
i think the <T_1> problem <T_0> we <T_2> is our own <T_4> to share our <T_3> .
<T_6> keep it <T_7> me to remind me of <T_3> ties that tie <T_1> to the young women <T_5> wrote about , ties that are not economic <T_8> personal in <T_2> , measured <T_9> in <T_4> but in <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s not <T_0> .
so <T_9> of just <T_4> destruction , we <T_8> to <T_0> the things <T_2> we might <T_7> , <T_3> someday <T_5> fda will <T_6> us to make french <T_1> .
now if you fall <T_0> the <T_6> on this <T_4> , then <T_8> get <T_5> , because <T_2> means <T_7> &apos;re <T_9> depressed <T_1> you have a disorder , or <T_3> both .
your <T_1> is <T_2> to be <T_0> .
<T_6> last <T_7> , i went to the snow <T_5> ice data center <T_2> boulder , colorado , and <T_1> to the <T_0> here <T_3> monterey at <T_4> naval postgraduate <T_8> .
so we &apos;re flying over here <T_1> what looks like a <T_0> hole .
<T_0> was 300 <T_1> .
<T_0> mcfadden : <T_1> the primal mystery
i <T_3> back <T_1> i started putting <T_2> team <T_6> , the <T_0> guys i could <T_4> with a <T_5> to <T_7> this .
<T_7> few <T_3> ago , i spent months <T_6> europe to see <T_0> major international <T_5> exhibitions that have the <T_4> of what is supposed to be going on <T_2> the <T_1> world .
<T_5> nick <T_4> , <T_6> director of <T_0> national <T_1> , <T_3> that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly <T_2> .
<T_3> was <T_4> most determined advocate for <T_0> &apos;s rights <T_2> had ever <T_1> .
there &apos;s this <T_7> that is preceded by a visual <T_5> , and <T_1> visual <T_8> , by the way -- and i &apos;ll show <T_3> a <T_4> -- but it sort of begins <T_2> little <T_9> lights , gets bigger and bigger until <T_0> fills your whole visual <T_6> .
jabbar : dana , i <T_1> &apos;t do this <T_0> you .
and <T_6> know because <T_0> you look <T_5> the <T_4> , these particular <T_1> , <T_7> globe skimmers <T_2> in temporary <T_3> water pools .
and dr. kang &apos;s going to walk <T_5> right now , and <T_6> &apos;re <T_4> going to <T_1> you one of <T_0> kidneys <T_2> we <T_3> a little bit earlier today .
<T_0> knows , &quot; <T_1> say .
<T_2> &apos;s the <T_0> where <T_4> than 50 <T_1> of the <T_3> say that they belong .
as <T_3> eighth-century <T_0> poet <T_5> , &quot; my longing <T_1> no <T_4> when it <T_2> . &quot;
it also <T_1> to be <T_0> and , in theory <T_2> .
<T_3> should <T_1> let your wife <T_2> something <T_0> this .
using <T_3> internet , i found <T_4> variety <T_1> statistics on <T_2> , and what <T_5> had <T_0> shocked me .
in <T_1> , what &apos;s now <T_0> is <T_2> much more <T_3> case of <T_4> .
this <T_0> what makes <T_1> so <T_2> .
and <T_1> transformation <T_0> .
<T_9> then you created earth <T_1> 4.5 <T_0> years ago , and then you got <T_6> about four <T_4> years ago , and then you got <T_7> about 0.006 billion years <T_5> , and then you got our <T_3> of <T_2> about 0.0015 billion <T_8> .
but <T_3> worry <T_1> this <T_0> is so <T_2> .
<T_1> is <T_0> same village <T_2> cambodia , just <T_4> couple of <T_3> ago .
it &apos;s <T_1> make them turn <T_5> back on what they think they like now , and reach out <T_3> something <T_4> up <T_0> mustard <T_2> .
<T_2> with thoughts , interdiction . &apos; &apos; elyn , <T_5> <T_1> feel like you &apos;re <T_3> to <T_4> or others ?
<T_0> his grandmother &apos;s away , <T_1> has sex with <T_4> girlfriend <T_2> his grandma &apos;s <T_3> .
<T_3> i <T_5> thinking about <T_0> the <T_2> why <T_4> was the <T_1> .
<T_3> gave of my <T_1> and <T_0> money , <T_2> gave when solutions were on <T_4> .
<T_0> a little , but it &apos;s <T_1> .
and <T_4> for <T_2> , one of the things that <T_3> thought would be to put some <T_1> my <T_6> in the <T_0> of promoting the worldchanging.com <T_5> .
that &apos;s where things <T_1> head -- <T_0> very early days . <T_2>
<T_1> right here i start <T_3> the visual , <T_2> i <T_5> ask the question : <T_6> section <T_0> the <T_4> ?
i &apos;m <T_2> asking <T_1> to <T_0> nicely <T_3> the sandpit .

we wish we were <T_1> husbands , <T_4> wives , <T_6> , more <T_2> , <T_5> , <T_3> -- <T_0> list goes on .
<T_0> teared <T_2> and i <T_4> that &apos;s where i <T_1> to <T_3> .
i &apos;ll <T_1> to <T_2> rush through this . <T_0> &apos;re <T_4> set <T_3> experiments .
so typically , <T_2> mammals <T_1> fast , die <T_0> .

we &apos;re <T_7> at valles <T_5> , <T_0> largest <T_6> in the <T_3> , <T_1> on <T_2> map of the united <T_4> , 3,000 miles across .
<T_0> wrote this <T_6> after <T_4> a <T_8> well known <T_2> tell a <T_5> well known <T_3> on <T_7> , &quot; i &apos;m really getting into the internet <T_1> .
a <T_0> success .
<T_4> rocket &apos;s position <T_2> by the <T_3> that <T_1> &apos;re <T_0> looking at .
<T_2> indeed , <T_8> do see <T_1> in the <T_6> entorhinal <T_4> , <T_0> is the same <T_5> of the <T_3> that you see grid <T_7> in rats .
there &apos;s <T_0> cut made in the scalp ; it &apos;s opened ; the <T_1> has a template ; he marks it around , and uses <T_5> dental burr to remove <T_3> piece of the cranial bone exactly <T_2> size of our <T_4> .
<T_0> said , &quot; <T_3> many <T_4> you <T_2> go <T_1> earlier than you <T_5> to ? &quot;
we <T_0> very <T_4> to <T_5> negative , but it <T_1> in <T_2> offset by the fact that we have <T_3> positivity .
<T_1> what are jobs <T_0> to be like ?
<T_0> we <T_2> was a <T_1> experiment .
<T_1> to <T_6> percent of <T_0> workforce <T_5> china is women <T_2> the <T_3> part of the country , whereas <T_4> india , it &apos;s all men .
so <T_7> use <T_1> state-of-the-art <T_0> to bounce stuff <T_4> the <T_6> , to <T_3> trails , pass <T_9> through <T_5> like sweden and belgium <T_2> enact those legal protections <T_8>
<T_2> . now <T_1> &apos;m going to change gears <T_0> .
but you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , <T_9> &apos;s <T_8> at <T_2> things -- <T_1> if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s <T_6> with <T_5> on the <T_7> , she &apos;s talking to the <T_4> , she &apos;s painting the <T_3> , she &apos;s doing open-heart <T_0> over here .
i don &apos;t want <T_0> have a conversation about that <T_1> .
<T_4> has done a much <T_2> job of <T_9> us <T_3> longer , and the problem is , as we <T_0> , our organs <T_5> to <T_1> more , <T_8> so <T_7> there are not enough <T_6> to go around .
<T_3> has to do with <T_1> up the strength of the other <T_0> against <T_2> and <T_5> statistical <T_4> .
the <T_1> is <T_0> on .
<T_4> of all , <T_3> it gets to the <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;s not <T_1> .
i &apos;ll <T_0> you something -- a little more of a concrete example here , as this thing loads .
<T_1> there understood <T_0> project .
now , in america <T_1> is a <T_5> degree : <T_6> get <T_3> university degree , <T_2> you go <T_0> to law <T_4> .
<T_2> i started <T_1> chair it <T_0> not a <T_3> notion .
dna repair <T_1> are more <T_2> in these <T_0> .
&quot; <T_3> , <T_1> to <T_0> mr. <T_2> . &quot;
<T_1> stavridis : a <T_0> admiral &apos;s thoughts <T_2> global security
<T_1> and <T_2> , i &apos;d like to end before <T_0> .
&quot; <T_1> feel in love with <T_0> . &quot; &quot; <T_3> feel so <T_2> . &quot;
&quot; <T_0> air <T_1> cost a <T_2> with tax .
so what we <T_2> them do was <T_1> this lower-left sound <T_0> , <T_3> .
it <T_0> a paralyzed phantom arm .
<T_2> then <T_0> creep up <T_6> the point that i get <T_3> score <T_5> 79 , which is <T_1> below <T_4> .
<T_1> i <T_2> &apos;t be able to <T_3> too <T_0> about it .
and <T_3> important is <T_0> negative <T_5> -- &quot; don &apos;t do to others what <T_1> would not <T_2> them <T_4> do to you . &quot;
and <T_1> &apos;d like to <T_0> the question , all of -- <T_2> need to <T_4> about <T_3> .
<T_0> is <T_1> ali-frazier of <T_2> . right ?
coca-cola , they &apos;ve <T_5> a lot <T_3> water , <T_1> right now , they &apos;re entering into 17-year contracts with growers <T_7> turkey to <T_2> juice into europe , and they &apos;re doing that <T_4> they <T_0> to have <T_9> product that &apos;s closer to <T_6> european <T_8> .
<T_1> &apos;m <T_0> today to offer <T_3> that <T_2> model .
<T_0> that &apos;s sort of <T_3> body channel <T_1> emotional empathy , which many <T_2> have .
<T_4> so does every wild <T_2> on the <T_0> , like the amazon <T_1> you &apos;re hearing <T_3> me .
<T_2> the second thing is <T_6> an ant &apos;s ability <T_3> assess <T_0> pattern must be <T_1> crude <T_7> no ant <T_5> do any sophisticated <T_4> .
and that &apos;s where family <T_1> , <T_2> child <T_0> is needed .
<T_8> a <T_4> atom <T_6> is <T_7> your <T_9> today <T_3> there when <T_5> event took place . matter <T_1> from place to place and momentarily <T_2> together <T_0> be you .
so my <T_6> and <T_8> have used <T_5> , the <T_0> tool of our <T_2> , to <T_7> people &apos;s imagination and help <T_1> imagine <T_3> it <T_9> be like to go into the <T_4> .
&quot; i <T_0> so . &quot;
<T_2> , <T_1> , they &apos;re becoming a very <T_0> force .
<T_3> by <T_0> squandering <T_4> the <T_2> &apos;s material <T_1> that defied credulity .
<T_0> morning , there <T_3> 600 people queuing <T_2> their <T_4> to reclaim <T_1> characters .
<T_4> a <T_3> or a <T_0> would <T_1> that they look the <T_2> ! &quot;
<T_2> vernacchio : sex needs <T_0> new metaphor . <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> ...
tapping <T_8> the <T_7> of his <T_5> book , nytimes columnist <T_3> brooks unpacks new insights into human <T_2> from the cognitive sciences -- insights with <T_4> implications for economics and <T_0> as well as <T_1> own self-knowledge . <T_9> a talk full of humor , he shows how you can &apos;t hope to understand humans as <T_6> individuals making choices based on their conscious awareness .
you &apos;re not going <T_1> get <T_0> from that .
<T_0> the most important third-party <T_5> came <T_4> a <T_2> company <T_3> virginia <T_1> summize .
and <T_6> &apos;s <T_2> very horrible thing to see <T_5> , <T_9> know <T_0> the police <T_1> the military -- there were <T_8> of military troops <T_4> -- actually can &apos;t stop that rampaging <T_7> who &apos;s coming down the <T_3> .
which way <T_2> it going <T_1> go ? it &apos;s hard <T_0> see .
but 60 <T_9> of research has <T_4> that <T_7> children <T_1> their <T_8> and placing them in large institutions <T_6> harms <T_0> health <T_2> development , and <T_3> is particularly true for <T_5> .
efficiency : this <T_3> data <T_1> illumination -- <T_4> &apos;s <T_0> of all an <T_2> .
so <T_6> , we <T_0> to take <T_3> column , and we decided to build it as a <T_5> model , made <T_4> of very <T_1> slices , thinly <T_2> over each other .
but <T_0> , <T_6> my better <T_2> , against <T_5> advice of my <T_7> wife , i <T_9> to <T_4> to dust off <T_1> of those legal skills -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_8> of those legal skills .
<T_4> actually in <T_3> ecosystems , you &apos;re just <T_0> likely to find <T_1> of symbiotic <T_2> .
so <T_3> it &apos;s able to train <T_4> just this <T_0> piece <T_2> the <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_6> solar-powered sea <T_3> . it &apos;s a <T_4> that <T_1> incorporated <T_5> inside it <T_0> drive its energy .
<T_1> , <T_0> is down to four <T_2> .
<T_0> then up <T_4> there &apos;s a <T_1> on <T_6> side of <T_5> living room , and <T_3> on the <T_2> side .
the only problem <T_0> it &apos;s <T_8> from a <T_2> french feminist <T_1> , <T_9> when <T_4> go to the <T_3> course <T_7> , it <T_6> to <T_5> lingerie-selling website .
those <T_0> my <T_2> . <T_1> get up at <T_3> a.m .
<T_2> sometimes <T_0> even watch <T_4> , cnn , from <T_3> united <T_1> .
<T_2> that &apos;s all <T_3> easy to draw <T_4> and things <T_0> that , but the point is <T_5> need to turn those <T_1> .
i think what we were most <T_2> in <T_1> promoting <T_7> kind of dialogue <T_4> we <T_3> may not have been happening <T_8> in this <T_0> , <T_6> what &apos;s really <T_5> there .
in fact , it <T_6> perhaps make <T_4> of <T_1> concepts <T_5> i <T_8> just in <T_7> to sort of <T_3> what a <T_2> living system <T_0> be . &quot;
i <T_5> you to remember <T_2> to create life &apos;s <T_0> diverse <T_4> complex <T_1> , life <T_3> computation to do that .
<T_3> small <T_2> are more <T_1> to accidents <T_0> bad luck .
<T_2> also noticed that as i started to do more <T_0> harder 30-day challenges , my self-confidence <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> school <T_0> qaeda .
<T_0> you .
<T_1> is <T_0> of <T_2> off .
<T_6> . <T_5> . <T_1> even have their <T_0> slurpee <T_4> : &quot; out of <T_2> . come <T_3> yesterday . &quot;
<T_0> had <T_2> that could wash <T_1> grayer .
how <T_2> individual <T_0> in that <T_1> am i listening <T_3> ?
<T_1> think <T_2> i never <T_0> pure .
but <T_8> &apos;s a technology <T_7> pervasive , <T_1> invisible , that we , for <T_2> long time , <T_6> to take <T_4> into <T_0> when <T_3> talked about human <T_5> .
because <T_0> really believe <T_5> can disrupt outdated <T_7> of business , <T_9> us <T_1> over <T_8> forms <T_4> hyper-consumption and teach <T_2> when <T_6> really <T_3> enough .
<T_3> place <T_2> chicago <T_0> really reached kind of a <T_4> of <T_1> stature .
<T_4> &apos;d looked at dental <T_1> under <T_6> microscope , and what they had <T_2> was <T_8> like pollen <T_0> plant starches , and they &apos;d found <T_7> cells from animal <T_3> and <T_5> .
but this is <T_2> this <T_3> concoction <T_1> high <T_0> .
i got <T_6> email <T_8> him <T_0> years <T_3> ; <T_5> said , &quot; i <T_1> i &apos;ve got an <T_4> to <T_2> of your <T_7> . &quot;
<T_0> didn &apos;t know <T_2> pollution did <T_3> than <T_1> bad visibility .
<T_2> i were in this <T_1> at any point <T_6> a <T_0> cosmological instants <T_5> , <T_3> would be as isolated <T_7> a <T_4> .
<T_5> &apos;s still <T_6> . <T_4> eats bread dough -- a <T_2> people do , <T_0> think , <T_3> not too <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_5> hall &apos;s green roof , next to <T_1> county &apos;s &#91; portion of <T_3> &#93; roof , which is 77 <T_6> fahrenheit hotter <T_0> the <T_4> .
so , <T_3> i went <T_6> look at those <T_2> , <T_0> noted that <T_1> the late <T_8> a <T_9> number of these dollars was actually leaving <T_5> united <T_7> , <T_4> to come back .
<T_2> something is out there <T_0> inspire our <T_1> now .
and <T_0> he did .
now we <T_3> know that <T_1> are fossilized , <T_0> so if you <T_5> it <T_6> acid , there <T_4> &apos;t be anything <T_2> .
<T_1> thinking <T_0> backwards .
notice <T_1> other , <T_0> protuberances .
what <T_0> this mean ?
<T_4> walked <T_1> walter reed <T_0> i <T_3> not have been more <T_2> .
and <T_2> , the colors of the interior are <T_1> and <T_0> .
at first i didn &apos;t think migraine headaches were <T_0> big problem <T_6> i &apos;d <T_1> had a migraine headache , <T_2> then i <T_4> to some people <T_9> have three or <T_8> every <T_7> of their life , and their lives are <T_5> totally ruined <T_3> it .
i <T_4> a couple <T_1> norway <T_2> year . we &apos;re seeing them <T_0> the <T_3> .
you know , this happens to be the <T_1> of architectural <T_0> two miles <T_4> of <T_2> town <T_3>
<T_0> safety they had was very <T_1> .
you <T_6> , <T_7> at the beginning of this <T_5> , <T_2> the turn <T_9> the new <T_3> , new <T_0> city mayor michael bloomberg made a new year &apos;s resolution <T_4> he was going to <T_1> to code <T_8> 2012 .
<T_6> i was saying , and i <T_5> , &quot; but <T_4> don &apos;t have <T_3> time , and <T_1> really don &apos;t have <T_7> immediate <T_0> at a technical <T_2> . &quot;
it <T_3> me several years , <T_4> with the help of <T_5> incredibly <T_0> family , <T_1> finally decided <T_2> was still <T_6> .
<T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> far-fetched <T_4> , <T_2> i <T_5> believe that <T_0> may be possible .
<T_2> , just <T_3> a <T_1> , for the moment , divided <T_4> two <T_0> .
now look <T_0> at this .
<T_5> &apos;s a <T_0> published by a <T_4> of <T_2> as an op-ed in <T_3> new york <T_1> .
thank you .
<T_0> you very much .
a <T_9> replicator <T_6> let loose , and <T_3> could never be -- right from the start -- it <T_1> never be <T_4> human beings who let loose this new <T_2> , could just copy the <T_7> , <T_5> , <T_8> things , and not copy <T_0> other things .
i &apos;m <T_0> a doctor . <T_2> have <T_1> medical <T_3> whatsoever .

<T_1> need to air out <T_0> pussy-cat . &quot;
and in <T_5> third <T_3> , i started becoming <T_0> because i <T_6> yemeni , but i <T_7> also mixing up with a <T_4> of <T_2> friends <T_1> college .
that was why <T_0> put it <T_2> a single <T_1> up there .
so we <T_3> to try to find a <T_1> to form <T_0> into useful <T_2> .
<T_1> fact , <T_0> is <T_2> months solid x-raying .
<T_0> put tens <T_6> thousands of these in <T_5> blood <T_8> -- they <T_9> this in <T_4> -- <T_1> lets <T_7> out in a <T_2> fashion , <T_3> actually cures type 1 diabetes .
i &apos;ve just got to <T_9> it to <T_4> all : <T_3> found <T_5> of my family <T_6> my adult life . i spent all of my adult life <T_8> them , and i &apos;ve <T_7> got a <T_0> dysfunctional <T_1> just like everybody <T_2> .

<T_0> one time i <T_2> in oakland <T_1> along broadway , and came <T_3> a <T_4> .
and <T_4> a teacher <T_2> medicine , <T_0> a student myself , i was so <T_3> by <T_1> story .
so for <T_6> small animal <T_5> with <T_3> fairly revolting <T_0> we can <T_1> learn an awful <T_2> from these things doing <T_4> that you and i couldn &apos;t possibly <T_7> .
<T_3> then we have <T_0> human-induced <T_2> of <T_1> as well .
<T_0> like <T_3> beautiful piano <T_1> board on the <T_2> .
as <T_0> child <T_5> , it <T_3> to <T_4> that the <T_1> trusted is violating <T_2> trust .
<T_2> is <T_3> of the most <T_0> things <T_1> know .
<T_1> it could <T_0> into the <T_2> with you .
<T_0> &apos;ll <T_8> that there <T_2> times <T_3> it seems <T_7> &quot; mission : impossible , &quot; <T_4> we <T_6> believe that <T_1> kids <T_5> smart .
<T_2> remind <T_0> that <T_1> all have <T_3> .
so , you <T_1> , i <T_3> what <T_2> can <T_4> the <T_0> .
<T_2> then <T_1> read in &quot; dear <T_3> &quot; that that was <T_0> .
because what i used to do , when <T_1> thought i was listening , was <T_0> would listen <T_8> enough to <T_7> what people had <T_6> say and think <T_4> i could -- i knew <T_2> they were going to say , <T_9> so <T_5> stopped <T_3> .
someone saw <T_2> on television ; they called me up ; and they <T_5> me if i &apos;d like to be <T_9> a <T_8> and to play a young doctor for a <T_0> of rock and <T_4> who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and <T_3> said , yes , i would do that , so i became <T_1> doctor in an <T_6> awful movie called <T_7> medicine ball caravan . &quot;
<T_0> again , that &apos;s <T_2> question <T_1> can answer .
well , do you think <T_9> could be some kind of disconnect between <T_7> extraordinarily <T_6> brain , the kind of brain <T_8> the ted technologies <T_0> , and the <T_4> heart ? talking <T_1> it in the non-scientific term , in terms of love and <T_3> . is <T_5> some <T_2> ?
i think stephen <T_1> had the <T_0> idea .
what <T_0> didn &apos;t anticipate <T_5> the <T_4> , <T_2> other <T_1> that would evolve from <T_6> very simple <T_3> .
so <T_8> made a group of work that at once faced <T_1> own personal <T_6> in life , <T_2> yet it brought <T_0> work <T_9> a larger discourse -- <T_7> subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that <T_5> of love <T_3> god , faith , but violence and crime and <T_4> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> bit <T_0> . &quot;
it &apos;s making silicon <T_8> important <T_0> aluminum , and <T_3> &apos;ll grow it in the <T_5> by adding more <T_6> to reach 350 for more <T_4> and <T_7> moore &apos;s <T_1> for more processing <T_2> .
so <T_2> don &apos;t think you can <T_0> your kids <T_1> much <T_3> .
this <T_8> a face-scanning <T_4> , with <T_0> white <T_7> all around <T_3> allow us to photograph <T_6> in <T_5> series <T_1> very controlled <T_2> conditions .
so , here we got the <T_0> area <T_2> the middle , and you can <T_1> it up .
now , you guys did <T_0> well . most people <T_1> at chance at this <T_2> .
and what &apos;s happening here , this is <T_0> you &apos;ve actually elected to <T_2> that nike <T_1> . <T_4> &apos;ve bought <T_3> it .
he wrote <T_1> a <T_0> .
and <T_2> , amidst <T_1> , <T_0> fluctuation <T_3> uniqueness .
<T_5> the year 1919 , a <T_6> unknown german <T_4> , named <T_2> kaluza suggested <T_7> very <T_1> and , in <T_0> ways , a <T_3> bizarre <T_8> .
it &apos;s almost , &quot; do <T_0> homework , &quot; -- <T_1> involvement .
that is , <T_3> informed <T_0> seems to be <T_4> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;re probably <T_2> going to make a deal here . &quot;
<T_6> the feeling <T_2> no one is <T_4> to me make us want <T_1> spend <T_3> with machines <T_0> seem to care about <T_5> .
it might <T_2> off into <T_3> hudson a little <T_1> before it destroyed <T_0> earth .
more <T_1> 80 <T_3> of <T_2> coast &apos;s development <T_0> into the modern <T_4> .
<T_1> they also <T_0> in <T_2> that people <T_3> getting rich for doing <T_4> .
now , <T_2> manifestation <T_3> this <T_0> on where in the <T_4> these <T_1> are .
&quot; <T_6> guardian &quot; megan <T_3> : <T_2> think you &apos;ll <T_5> agree <T_0> we &apos;d be <T_7> off if <T_1> all had the <T_4> picture .
<T_5> this is why <T_0> is so <T_6> disruptive -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_9> accurate as <T_2> , it &apos;s far <T_4> complex to <T_8> , and it &apos;s a <T_7> of the <T_1> .
we <T_1> that , when monolinguals were <T_3> in taipei <T_2> seattle <T_5> the mandarin <T_0> , they showed the <T_4> pattern .
<T_9> , <T_8> art in <T_5> 20th <T_7> is about doing something <T_6> and filling <T_4> void <T_3> explanation and <T_1> -- essentially <T_2> same as <T_0> did .
but <T_5> things we <T_2> in common set <T_4> apart from most of the <T_0> in <T_7> community , and i am in between these two <T_8> , <T_6> enough of my <T_3> to fight for justice <T_1> the <T_9> .
<T_4> , you know , people would always <T_0> james <T_5> -- <T_1> &apos;s not <T_2> the most politically <T_3> guy ...
<T_3> seven percent <T_0> that they <T_1> &apos;t consider <T_2> a skycar .
i am <T_1> swimming in <T_0> and <T_3> and <T_2> .
we &apos;re studying <T_2> , i &apos;m studying <T_5> , <T_1> he &apos;s <T_4> , &quot; <T_6> &apos;s <T_0> good <T_3> to do .
<T_2> capra &apos;s classic <T_1> independence and <T_0> .
and sometimes <T_2> doing this <T_0> of research , you encounter <T_1> beautiful ideas of design .
so <T_5> idea is , all <T_2> long the <T_1> skin of the <T_0> lung will <T_4> inflate itself , including air <T_3> molecules , for sure .
<T_5> it &apos;s kind of nice , <T_3> sun and <T_1> moon getting together this <T_2> , <T_4> if <T_6> is eating the <T_0> .
<T_1> wolfram , thank <T_0> .
<T_0> public place so <T_1> that the winos don &apos;t <T_2> want to <T_3> .
<T_4> if <T_1> come , you <T_3> to <T_2> for everybody who comes to the <T_0> . &quot;
<T_4> my <T_0> i &apos;ve had <T_3> exposures to <T_7> , <T_6> is two <T_5> many , because <T_1> stays with you for <T_2> .
when <T_9> , <T_2> , imagination are <T_3> , <T_0> , at <T_4> last , take <T_5> place at the <T_7> , <T_6> strategies of <T_1> are in the process of being <T_8> .
<T_1> was wearing <T_0> t-shirt <T_2> the one <T_3> wear now .
duct tape .
how <T_6> of <T_2> once <T_5> your -- you <T_1> a kid , you were an <T_7> -- you stood <T_4> a <T_8> space to <T_3> it <T_0> someone ?
if <T_0> change the <T_3> , <T_1> can <T_2> to that .
if <T_1> hear nothing else <T_3> , <T_5> hear this : <T_2> are <T_0> &quot; <T_4> . &quot;
because <T_1> is the <T_3> : <T_4> load <T_0> laundry , <T_2> what do you <T_5> out of <T_6> machine ?
<T_1> is your conference , and <T_3> think <T_4> have <T_2> right <T_5> know a little bit right now , in <T_9> transition period , about <T_6> guy who &apos;s going <T_8> be looking after it for <T_0> for a <T_7> .
is <T_1> possible , all these <T_0> later , to <T_2> tolstoy was <T_3> ?
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> a lot .
and in <T_1> decades , a <T_3> of the funding <T_0> shop <T_4> has gone away <T_2> .
<T_5> so we &apos;ll lose <T_1> little <T_4> . big <T_0> . it <T_2> &apos;t make any <T_3> . &quot;
<T_0> you &apos;re in it , <T_3> , obviously , is <T_1> place to be at <T_2> moment .
it <T_4> , at that time , to be <T_1> sea of <T_2> , but <T_0> we know , <T_7> now <T_3> are <T_5> paradise <T_6> .
<T_0> that being <T_2> and no real <T_1> for it .
so <T_3> koran in <T_2> is a <T_0> of shadow of <T_7> , or <T_1> arthur <T_6> called his <T_5> , &quot; <T_4> interpretation . &quot;
<T_6> i &apos;m <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> i &apos;m <T_4> and it &apos;s cheap , <T_1> you know , <T_5> kind of <T_3> pittsburgh . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s the <T_2> , getting <T_1> of it all .
they <T_2> &apos;t know exactly <T_0> they <T_1> doing .
<T_0> were risk takers , of <T_1> .
and after eight <T_0> they might actually yield <T_3> timber -- that is , <T_1> you <T_2> preserve <T_9> in <T_5> right <T_6> , <T_8> we can do <T_7> bamboo <T_4> .
i <T_5> papercutting <T_3> paper is cheap , it &apos;s <T_2> , and you <T_1> use it <T_4> a lot of different <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_2> silicon wafer , <T_4> essentially that &apos;s just a <T_0> bunch <T_6> layers of two-dimensional <T_5> , sort of <T_3> up .
<T_2> i <T_1> i can <T_0> us that <T_4> do <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> about overthrowing <T_0> .
so <T_3> you <T_4> at this , <T_5> might immediately <T_2> that different <T_1> have different numbers of <T_0> .
<T_1> also , <T_9> things go <T_3> , we <T_6> to fix <T_7> outside so much , <T_2> our <T_5> of <T_0> outer world is <T_8> , temporary , and <T_4> , illusory .
<T_1> less <T_2> 40 years , there will <T_3> 9 <T_0> of us .
<T_2> also the other <T_3> is good , <T_1> all the other <T_4> have good hands <T_0> .
i <T_4> to conclude with <T_0> worry -- <T_5> have a <T_1> -- and with <T_3> wonderful <T_2> .
so it <T_0> very <T_1> .
and so <T_0> you <T_3> any note at all -- <T_2> i just <T_9> a <T_4> note -- -- <T_8> knew <T_5> what it was , and you &apos;d got the <T_7> as well to find that <T_6> on <T_1> piano .
<T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> telescope .
i would <T_6> out my <T_3> . i would send out hundreds <T_5> postcards <T_2> editors <T_4> art <T_7> , but <T_0> would go <T_1> .
<T_2> he realized he <T_1> a set whose <T_4> of <T_3> was larger than <T_0> .
so <T_1> next time <T_5> as cute as <T_9> shows up on <T_2> doorstep , and sometimes <T_0> creature &apos;s called <T_6> and <T_4> ford <T_7> sometimes ... <T_8> you want -- you &apos;ve just got to say <T_3> .
and <T_1> &apos;re in the business of <T_0> soundscapes .
<T_0> is when we see <T_1> birth of <T_3> transnational <T_2> organization al qaeda .
you <T_3> &apos;t be here <T_1> you <T_4> &apos;t <T_2> this , yet you <T_0> it .
you know , he never quite made <T_1> to <T_8> of them every <T_9> , <T_4> he wanted to visit <T_3> 156 prisoners . and <T_2> would lift <T_6> , <T_5> he would put <T_0> fingers <T_7> .
so <T_0> does <T_1> work ?
you <T_0> &apos;t have any ...
and so <T_0> can generate <T_1> force <T_2> .
privacy <T_0> nonnegotiable .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> for me .
and <T_1> are <T_0> the street rallying <T_2> improve the shield laws .
and <T_2> , <T_8> i just allowed <T_1> to be overwhelmed by <T_3> feelings , i wouldn &apos;t be doing my <T_7> -- because <T_4> have to actually be there <T_5> them <T_6> make sure <T_0> rituals happen , that <T_9> are seen to .
<T_2> is not about <T_1> technology , <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> rearranging our metal <T_3> .
<T_2> at that <T_1> age , <T_3> years old , benki <T_4> the <T_0> of his community .
and so <T_6> we <T_8> at <T_7> map of skin color , and <T_2> skin color , as we know it <T_5> , what we see is <T_9> beautiful gradient from the <T_4> skin pigmentations toward <T_3> equator , and <T_0> lightest <T_1> toward the poles .
darwin <T_2> , &quot; <T_1> why <T_0> you be so <T_3> ? &quot;
we &apos;re <T_1> about books <T_0> hyper geometric partial differential equations .
and i realized <T_3> the <T_2> empire was <T_1> to come crashing down <T_0> i <T_4> in a <T_5> .
<T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s not how <T_1> do it . &quot;
<T_7> would take <T_4> breakfast in bed , and <T_1> , <T_0> an <T_5> track suit <T_2> slippers , he would go <T_3> a <T_8> around <T_6> garden .
<T_8> just threw <T_3> in <T_5> as <T_2> as all of <T_4> intellectual abilities <T_6> , without heart <T_0> without love it &apos;s <T_1> -- it &apos;s <T_7> meaningless .
in <T_0> engrossing eg <T_8> , architect <T_4> diller shares her firm ds + r &apos;s more unusual <T_3> , <T_7> the blur <T_1> , <T_9> walls are <T_2> fog , and the revamped alice <T_6> hall , which is wrapped in glowing wooden <T_5> .
it &apos;s <T_8> on a shaft and <T_0> ball , right <T_3> center of gravity , or <T_5> slightly above the center of gravity <T_6> which means <T_4> <T_1> lower half <T_7> the object <T_9> just a little bit more <T_2> .
<T_2> , by the way , means respecting <T_0> wisdom of all <T_3> -- and <T_1> &apos;ll get to that .
<T_0> says , &quot; i <T_1> your <T_2> . that &apos;s why . &quot;
there we go .
rachel <T_4> remen <T_2> a <T_0> doctor <T_3> of her life-long struggle <T_1> crohn &apos;s disease .
so if <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> responsibility , <T_3> are <T_2> going to do that ?
<T_3> i <T_2> to just make <T_0> point about this <T_1> .
<T_6> at 16 , <T_2> stumbled across another <T_3> , <T_4> i earned <T_5> first acting <T_1> in <T_0> film .
don &apos;t you say <T_3> negative that <T_4> &apos;s only only <T_1> teenage thing , or <T_5> &apos;s only <T_0> i &apos;m <T_2> girl .
<T_8> &apos;s <T_1> , and it &apos;s not pleasant to <T_6> about , <T_4> your <T_9> might leave you , your girlfriend could cheat , your headaches might <T_5> more serious than you <T_3> , <T_2> your dog <T_0> get hit by a <T_7> on the street .
in <T_4> house , wires run in <T_3> wall , <T_0> the light switch <T_6> a junction box <T_5> the <T_1> and <T_2> the <T_7> to the light bulb .
or <T_1> with <T_2> complex <T_0> .
<T_0> the other remarkable <T_5> is it &apos;s , i <T_3> , the <T_2> status <T_1> car <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;m going to <T_1> a piece of <T_2> for you .
<T_8> friend came to see me last year -- and <T_4> doesn &apos;t mind <T_3> telling this <T_5> -- a friend came <T_0> see me last year <T_2> said , &quot; <T_6> , <T_7> &apos;ve read <T_1> book .
let &apos;s talk <T_4> how we can use <T_0> technology , the <T_5> of our <T_2> , to <T_1> this <T_6> the life <T_3> can love .
we <T_0> superstar lawyers <T_1> superstar architects .
<T_8> from the <T_1> , these <T_5> look like any other <T_7> structure <T_6> the <T_4> , <T_2> you step inside , you are met with <T_3> manner of design <T_9> and <T_0> .
i <T_1> him to think of <T_3> kind of <T_0> as <T_4> eight-track <T_2> .
<T_3> deworming , you can <T_1> an <T_4> year <T_2> education <T_0> three dollars .
so i am <T_4> surgeon who studies <T_5> , <T_9> i have <T_6> had a patient tell <T_1> that &quot; i really want <T_2> to be creative during <T_0> , &quot; and so <T_8> guess <T_3> &apos;s <T_7> little bit of irony to it .
<T_0> was on <T_1> .
<T_1> , <T_0> was <T_4> first great <T_5> president of the 20th <T_6> who taught <T_3> about environmental thinking -- teddy <T_2> .
<T_1> do we manage <T_0> quality control ?
cp : <T_2> and <T_0> were mentioned <T_1> .
so we <T_0> to <T_7> in <T_1> , trawled through <T_3> documents <T_4> other <T_5> trying <T_6> piece together <T_2> really true picture of the deal .
<T_0> again , if you just look <T_1> this bat , you <T_3> sound is very <T_4> for <T_2> survival .
and <T_2> sat there for quite <T_0> time going , &quot; <T_1> am i going to get <T_4> this rock <T_3> go <T_5> ?
you <T_3> in <T_1> you zoom in <T_2> you zoom in and you <T_5> in , <T_0> you can <T_4> read it now .
<T_2> &apos;s what <T_3> called <T_1> &quot; banality <T_0> evil . &quot;
so <T_0> did <T_1> city like this feed itself ?
<T_1> &apos;m going to talk <T_3> growing <T_0> in traditional <T_2> .
if you look along <T_1> edge of the frill , <T_7> have these <T_6> triangular bones <T_8> actually grow big <T_2> triangles <T_4> then they flatten <T_5> the <T_3> pretty much like <T_9> spikes do <T_0> the pachycephalosaurs .
<T_0> , it <T_1> gets <T_2> than this .
it ain &apos;t okay . you know what ? it is <T_0> okay .
and <T_4> &apos;s probably <T_2> having a lot of <T_6> right now , <T_0> he is a <T_7> in the <T_3> , of <T_1> you <T_8> want to be <T_5> condoms .
<T_0> did this <T_1> ? when did this <T_2> ?
this <T_1> our <T_0> before .
<T_1> have already <T_0> conservation in the <T_2> country .
<T_4> &apos;m <T_0> to thinking of the ted <T_6> as a <T_5> collection of <T_1> of the most <T_7> , <T_9> , intellectual , <T_2> , worldly and <T_3> people in <T_8> world .
we don &apos;t know the answer to that <T_2> , but we will learn <T_1> answer this year , thanks to nasa &apos;s kepler space telescope , <T_5> in fact , the smart money , which is to say the people who work <T_0> this <T_8> , the smart money is suggesting that the <T_4> of planets that might be suitable <T_9> life <T_3> maybe one in a thousand , one in a <T_7> , <T_6> like that .
there <T_2> interaction <T_1> galaxies . <T_0> know this .
and <T_0> can see <T_1> in micrometeorites .
well , i <T_1> to be an inventor <T_3> like <T_0> dad ; <T_2> did michael .
<T_5> next is a <T_4> of artists called the silver <T_1> , and <T_2> motto <T_3> to spread pragmatism <T_0> person at <T_6> time .
<T_3> do we see <T_0> extremely high <T_2> in some <T_1> ?
those <T_1> have <T_0> touched google .
and <T_9> &apos;s no <T_8> that <T_5> died , because <T_6> don &apos;t know <T_2> much of this gas <T_0> person is going to <T_7> , <T_4> position they &apos;re going to fall in <T_3> they become unconscious and <T_1> on .
<T_5> were sort of very <T_4> ho with <T_0> success <T_2> australia and new zealand <T_1> that <T_3> .
<T_5> was <T_1> of adored on <T_0> right the <T_2> eleanor roosevelt was <T_3> the <T_4> .
and <T_1> &apos;s sort of like <T_0> better <T_3> of the <T_2> .
<T_0> if <T_5> is so <T_3> for <T_1> , <T_2> don &apos;t we vote <T_4> compassion ?
and the <T_0> has <T_1> core stages .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> jewish saying <T_1> i love .
and <T_4> , <T_3> extreme <T_5> are <T_1> good places <T_0> we <T_2> to stop the shifting sands .
<T_2> won &apos;t , but it <T_9> us a chance to study these <T_0> of <T_1> . we didn &apos;t <T_4> necessarily understand <T_3> keyholes , <T_6> now we do and it turns out <T_5> &apos;s really <T_8> , <T_7> how do you stop an asteroid like this ?
modeling , they <T_0> modeling <T_1> the time . they were always modeling things .
<T_1> name <T_5> britlin <T_2> , and this is <T_0> video that i &apos;d <T_4> to make for <T_3> .
<T_1> thought , how <T_0> money do <T_3> have in <T_2> pocket ?
<T_1> refer in <T_0> history to <T_2> moments as <T_3> moments .
<T_7> it &apos;s a <T_2> powerful and <T_1> reminder of <T_8> the <T_9> of <T_0> has the ability to <T_3> where words <T_5> , <T_6> this <T_4> literally speak .
<T_5> myself <T_2> a <T_3> and <T_0> father and <T_4> sons whom i <T_1> love .
so , <T_6> you look <T_3> the viremia thing <T_8> , if <T_4> do <T_1> treatment <T_7> you &apos;re <T_0> , well , <T_5> happens ? your <T_2> load comes down .
<T_9> of it <T_7> be , and there <T_3> terrorists , <T_1> are we <T_4> thinking about terrorists as <T_8> an existential <T_0> that we <T_5> willing to <T_2> anything at all to <T_6> them ?
all across most <T_0> masses .
<T_1> -- <T_0> of them <T_2> impossible .
<T_4> us <T_8> , <T_6> technique is used to create imaginary <T_7> in fiction <T_2> in movies , to <T_3> emotions with <T_1> , <T_0> and dance <T_5>
as an <T_2> , how <T_3> you feel <T_1> this <T_0> ?
<T_0> didn &apos;t <T_1> if it didn &apos;t create a day of <T_2> .
<T_4> i &apos;m writing <T_0> book <T_3> all this , <T_6> &apos;m <T_1> looking into it , <T_2> i don &apos;t have the <T_5> .
if <T_3> live up <T_5> , in summer the sun is coming <T_1> directly down , but <T_0> winter it &apos;s coming <T_4> a huge amount of atmosphere , and <T_8> of the ultraviolet <T_9> weeded out , and <T_7> range of wavelengths that hit the <T_6> are <T_2> from summer to winter .
i find that <T_0> to <T_1> .
niels <T_0> : rethinking <T_1> way we sit down
<T_0> mark <T_2> with <T_6> gps fix , <T_3> we also take <T_4> digital photograph <T_1> the specimen , so <T_5> could <T_8> put it back on the <T_7> , exactly where <T_9> found it .
and <T_1> four months , <T_3> up , you know , off of the <T_2> part of <T_0> .
so <T_7> &apos;s a <T_3> good <T_4> beyond curiosity <T_1> justify <T_6> we &apos;re doing , <T_5> to justify having some interest <T_2> what is going on in our <T_0> .
<T_0> bought that last <T_2> . <T_3> &apos;re very difficult to <T_1> .
<T_2> hope <T_0> finds that <T_1> .
and nand2tetris <T_4> one of the <T_1> massive , open , <T_2> courses , <T_0> seven <T_6> ago we had <T_5> idea that what we <T_3> doing is called moocs .
<T_1> i &apos;m really <T_6> to <T_2> to <T_4> today that <T_0> first synthetic self-cleaning , dry <T_3> has been <T_5> .
<T_0> didn &apos;t recommend <T_1> , by the way .
<T_1> is a huge <T_0> .
the <T_0> go on and on .
the <T_5> in chicago <T_2> that as well <T_1> exhibiting our <T_7> , what they <T_4> to do <T_6> have <T_0> local <T_8> there make a <T_3> .
so <T_2> went out <T_4> collected a whole <T_0> of stuff and <T_3> found a whole <T_5> of little <T_1> .
&quot; the <T_3> times sent <T_0> to the <T_2> film <T_7> with a portable <T_5> the size <T_6> a suitcase <T_4> the porteram <T_1> .
here &apos;s what it <T_1> like <T_0> actual use .
i <T_0> no <T_1> . i <T_3> &apos;t know <T_2> that thing <T_4> .
<T_3> the thing <T_1> , <T_4> could make the <T_0> the whole <T_2> .
and <T_0> need to do <T_2> about it <T_1> now .
<T_2> no <T_3> of the <T_4> spectrum has <T_0> monopoly on either of those <T_1> .
<T_4> biomimicry <T_0> , which is my <T_1> company , <T_3> work with hok <T_2> .
when <T_5> say she &apos;s a programmer , she <T_7> do some , <T_6> the <T_1> thing is <T_4> have said the <T_0> is going to be much , much <T_3> than <T_2> .
<T_2> i &apos;ve noticed a <T_1> small <T_0> in the profile of <T_4> of the planet host <T_3> .
and <T_0> a <T_4> ago , this <T_2> passed <T_1> the icelandic <T_3> unanimously .
<T_2> are <T_1> an <T_0> flourishing taking place .
and <T_2> it bursts <T_0> a forest of <T_1> .
<T_1> love <T_2> , <T_0> know .
<T_1> &apos;s designed <T_0> really be two-way .
one of <T_4> shattering <T_8> in <T_5> history <T_3> mathematics , <T_7> is not <T_2> by many <T_1> , occurred about <T_0> years ago , 145 <T_6> ago .
i &apos;ll <T_2> you to <T_1> top of the <T_0> .
<T_7> fifth <T_6> is <T_5> maybe , <T_1> 2,500 years , <T_0> is still <T_2> his way with us in <T_3> notion <T_4> perfect forms .
and <T_2> i see it <T_6> something <T_3> &apos;s just <T_0> basic for survival -- <T_4> -- as <T_5> some of the basic <T_1> about public health .
<T_0> talk <T_1> it .
<T_2> one , i would <T_1> , was <T_0> serious <T_3> .
the <T_2> is from the <T_1> potter <T_0> opinion on <T_3> .
<T_1> there , <T_3> basic <T_5> is that <T_0> leads you to do good <T_2> for <T_6> who then will return the <T_4> .
and the <T_1> was saying , <T_3> , <T_2> &apos;s 10,000 <T_0> day .
<T_2> know , this <T_0> one of <T_1> favorite devices .
so <T_2> tasmanian devil cancer <T_0> perhaps the <T_1> cancer .
this <T_7> with its <T_4> dots : they might <T_0> like <T_5> dots to <T_9> , <T_8> if i tell you , to a male <T_3> of the right species , that looks <T_6> two <T_1> who are really , really hot to <T_2> .
and it <T_1> no difference <T_0> their <T_2> at all .
<T_1> far , so <T_0> .
<T_8> , <T_1> service <T_6> so <T_0> users could <T_3> people in their <T_5> area <T_7> share their interests <T_9> affinities <T_2> actually have <T_4> real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .
<T_3> doesn &apos;t matter <T_0> you &apos;re making <T_6> record <T_1> , <T_5> you &apos;re an architect , or you have <T_2> tract <T_4> sociology .
i &apos;ll start <T_1> insulin , <T_2> in <T_0> u.s .
this <T_2> the <T_0> in which <T_5> as the <T_1> and <T_6> client can begin to inject <T_4> and <T_3> .
so <T_2> car seat was <T_1> an above-average car seat from <T_4> reports , and <T_3> quite <T_0> .
and i <T_0> on september 11th , on 14th street , the <T_4> of our <T_9> -- we can <T_3> the <T_6> trade towers <T_2> -- and i saw <T_8> first building collapse from a conference room <T_1> the eighth floor on <T_7> tv that <T_5> had set up .
you know , <T_2> computer <T_4> television <T_3> recently turned 60 , and <T_1> i &apos;d <T_5> to talk about <T_0> relationship .
<T_0> thing that we do know <T_4> the <T_2> is doing is the <T_1> is assisting these <T_3> .
<T_0> you so much .
<T_3> get <T_4> high-level <T_1> of the computer <T_2> , a high-level description of the <T_0> .
plenty of robots can fly -- but <T_1> can fly like a <T_4> bird . that is , until markus fischer and his team at festo <T_3> smartbird , a <T_9> , <T_6> robot , <T_8> on a seagull , that flies <T_7> flapping its wings . <T_2> soaring demo fresh <T_0> tedglobal <T_5> .
there <T_0> is .
<T_1> do not stand <T_0> today to suggest <T_3> any way that conducting <T_2> clinical trials in developing countries is bad .
<T_3> &apos;s still <T_1> . <T_2> &apos;s there <T_0> morning , actually .
<T_4> babbage , babbage himself <T_0> born at the <T_3> of the 18th <T_5> , and was <T_2> fairly <T_1> mathematician .
<T_5> started <T_2> book with a <T_3> about how <T_6> it is to build <T_0> in <T_1> world of <T_4> .
i really <T_2> to come up with <T_0> ways of children &apos;s <T_1> that <T_5> and <T_3> and <T_4> .
and look at all the <T_2> things and <T_3> things we &apos;ve been able to create <T_4> just a one <T_1> a <T_0> .
why is intel <T_1> to fund <T_0> ?
so <T_3> wanted to change the <T_0> that <T_6> approach technology , to create <T_7> more convivial and social space that was more <T_4> , more accessible , <T_9> also to increase <T_1> ability <T_2> teachers to use these <T_8> for technology-based <T_5> .
and <T_4> you , <T_5> is <T_2> getting just <T_0> little more <T_1> just a little <T_3> .
<T_1> the <T_4> time you download a <T_2> , <T_0> two <T_6> , <T_5> &apos;s not for <T_3> , ok ?
what women <T_6> up to <T_4> me was how <T_0> were <T_3> , and how they were <T_9> , <T_2> how they were beaten , and how they were gang-raped in <T_5> , and how <T_8> were incested by <T_7> <T_1> .
so suddenly , i was <T_7> in human-powered flight -- -- <T_4> did not -- the way i <T_2> it , <T_5> , thinking about ways to <T_0> the planes , was just like they &apos;d been doing <T_9> england , and <T_3> succeeding , <T_8> i gave it up . i figured , nah , <T_1> isn &apos;t any simple , easy <T_6> .
let <T_1> just say , look , my <T_3> is a privilege <T_2> we &apos;re in <T_4> special <T_0> .
<T_7> a more recent follow-up study , we were able to look at <T_1> much greater sample , a much larger sample . in this case , this is nearly 30,000 u.s. <T_4> , and <T_8> find <T_0> same pattern . as you can see , people who <T_9> on the very conservative side of <T_3> the political orientation scale are <T_5> much more likely to report <T_6> they &apos;re <T_2> disgusted .
<T_3> , i <T_4> rotate by <T_0> third of a <T_1> clockwise <T_5> a third of <T_2> turn anticlockwise .
<T_3> have <T_2> means by which we could <T_1> a truly <T_0> society .
the point <T_0> then recorded into <T_1> 3d visualization <T_2> .
if <T_3> go look at <T_4> website today , they &apos;ll actually <T_0> these <T_6> , <T_5> , <T_7> rest <T_2> lost in a <T_1> .
<T_2> you don &apos;t <T_0> about it <T_1> much .
<T_2> used to <T_4> . <T_3> thought <T_0> would be an <T_1> .
look <T_0> the pentagon , for <T_1> , pull this <T_2> -- <T_3> becomes <T_5> boat shape <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> six-day immersive <T_3> for <T_0> kids .
so rather <T_8> a super strong or super fast arm , <T_3> &apos;re making an arm <T_5> is -- we &apos;re <T_1> with , <T_7> 25th percentile female -- that will have <T_0> hand <T_9> wraps around , opens all the way , <T_4> degrees of freedom <T_2> the wrist and an <T_6> .
<T_1> : it detects <T_0> .
and <T_1> is what <T_2> marine scientists have <T_0> too .
so with <T_8> , i would just <T_9> to <T_1> thank and honor sylvia <T_3> for her wish , for it is helping <T_5> to put a <T_0> on <T_2> high <T_6> and the <T_7> seas beyond national <T_4> .
does amazon <T_0> it ?
<T_0> must <T_1> it <T_2> .
and <T_1> few <T_8> ago , i was walking in <T_0> aviv and <T_4> saw this graffiti on <T_2> wall , <T_5> i <T_6> it so compelling that by now i <T_9> it to my students , <T_3> i &apos;d like to try to <T_7> it to you .
and <T_3> sat here <T_5> we looked at <T_1> two <T_7> , <T_0> finally we came <T_4> a <T_6> . <T_2> aren &apos;t problems .
<T_3> so , <T_1> way <T_4> hopefully <T_2> who &apos;s friendly <T_0> who isn &apos;t .
and <T_0> focused <T_2> research on <T_3> as a possible source for <T_1> .
<T_2> the <T_6> sentence of <T_4> dorma <T_0> she was singing in <T_5> stadium was &quot; <T_3> onion for <T_1> . &quot;
now , as a business professor , and as any business professor would <T_4> you , an <T_0> organization requires <T_6> integrated strategy that <T_3> a <T_2> organizational <T_5> , <T_8> incentives , <T_9> solid identity <T_1> good brand <T_7> .
i <T_1> to give you three <T_0> .
i <T_1> concerned about making <T_0> place for <T_3> study <T_2> law .
<T_1> , <T_2> reversal <T_0> trade policy .
<T_9> do have the <T_2> that &apos;s <T_7> , and our network of global <T_0> has been <T_4> and <T_3> be expanded at a <T_8> rate , <T_6> we &apos;re comfortable <T_1> this task <T_5> be accomplished .
<T_0> do we study <T_1> ?
<T_3> students , it &apos;s quite <T_1> experience , but for <T_0> school , it could be very <T_4> or <T_2> to maintain .

<T_1> we now know <T_3> about <T_2> future of the <T_5> to <T_0> a <T_4> more .
<T_0> it <T_6> &apos;t make any sense , because i <T_1> finally <T_7> to <T_5> my <T_2> , <T_3> yet <T_4> was creatively <T_8> .

and in fact , if <T_1> could do that , what you would see is <T_0> like this .
<T_6> then i <T_5> out that <T_0> were all <T_7> of papers <T_1> published that addressed this <T_2> because it happens already in <T_4> natural <T_3> .
so <T_2> was <T_1> defined by ethnicity , and <T_3> nation-state <T_0> that .

<T_1> don &apos;t know ; <T_4> &apos;m <T_3> sure , <T_5> that &apos;s <T_2> i &apos;ve done <T_0> the time .
<T_2> ! <T_0> is louis <T_1> ?
<T_3> , let me just <T_0> you , <T_2> quickly , <T_4> top targets for <T_1> medicine .
you <T_3> that . <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> true , of course , but <T_6> &apos;s <T_1> media <T_5> , and that &apos;s like what you <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;re <T_1> out , we &apos;re zooming <T_5> , out <T_2> a nuclear <T_3> , <T_0> is the gateway <T_9> this <T_6> that <T_7> all the dna <T_8> the nucleus .
<T_7> : so you have to <T_1> , looking <T_3> the eyes <T_4> lions <T_5> leopards <T_2> now , <T_6> is all <T_0> critical awareness .
<T_3> need <T_5> reduce c02 <T_1> in ten to <T_0> years by <T_4> percent in <T_6> to avert <T_2> effects .

<T_3> we see <T_0> get more <T_5> than their <T_2> playing with legos <T_4> putting together plastic <T_1> .
wow .
&quot; <T_1> thank you , &quot; was more <T_0> it .
<T_1> &apos;m <T_0> tulley .
and <T_1> number one <T_0> tip : never , ever look at the <T_2> .
but more than <T_3> , people are building <T_0> houses <T_5> green <T_4> , <T_6> their kids <T_1> walk to <T_2> on the paths .
<T_2> &apos;s a worry -- isn &apos;t it ? -- <T_8> the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such <T_5> bad job that <T_3> little <T_0> of activists <T_1> able to <T_7> more <T_9> that type of information <T_6> the rest of the world press <T_4> .
so baxter <T_0> up <T_1> .
so , i &apos;ll plug <T_0> in .
<T_1> we are <T_2> monterey -- <T_3> i <T_0> get it right .
<T_3> mean , <T_2> about <T_4> . <T_0> grand . how <T_1> .
<T_2> construct it and <T_0> construct <T_1> ideas .
so i turned <T_1> the teeming small <T_7> that can be held <T_0> the thumb <T_8> forefinger : <T_4> little things <T_2> the foundation of our <T_6> , the little <T_3> , as i <T_5> to say , who <T_9> the world .
so does <T_3> , so does <T_0> high fat <T_1> , so <T_4> emotional <T_2> .
now , finning is <T_1> act of taking <T_6> shark , <T_2> the valuable <T_3> off <T_5> throwing the live <T_0> back in the <T_4> .
i <T_5> the <T_1> for <T_7> is -- <T_6> &apos;m <T_9> certain that that <T_3> happen , the challenge <T_2> , will <T_4> develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage <T_0> that <T_8> ?
<T_2> these <T_0> satisfy these <T_1> requirements of living <T_3> .
<T_0> imagine what might <T_1> , <T_3> every region <T_2> something to <T_4> .
<T_2> were <T_0> co-authors of <T_3> book <T_1> &quot; manifesta . &quot;
<T_2> &apos;s taken <T_0> a wider <T_1> area .
well , what i want <T_2> to think about for a <T_4> is <T_0> happens after that , after <T_1> drop your <T_3> into the ballot <T_5> .
<T_1> and <T_4> are <T_0> that are often <T_2> to people who are not <T_3> the sciences .
only <T_1> percent were <T_2> or doctors <T_0> teachers .
my <T_2> said that she thought <T_1> &apos;d really rather have <T_0> blue <T_3> .
<T_1> don &apos;t <T_0> care <T_2> about <T_3> national happiness ? &quot;
so , again , this is <T_1> we &apos;re doing with <T_0> hillis and a <T_6> called applied <T_5> , <T_3> we can start <T_9> see <T_2> neutron differences , and we <T_4> start to look at that <T_7> like we never have <T_8> .
<T_0> is a <T_2> one , and it <T_1> &apos;t <T_3> .
we &apos;re <T_3> that they <T_1> have <T_0> language in <T_2> wild .
i <T_2> to understand <T_0> violence , <T_1> oppression , works .
and i got <T_0> tell <T_4> , <T_1> you <T_5> &apos;t <T_6> high-definition surround , <T_3> down to your <T_2> dealer , your audiophile dealer .
she <T_3> her <T_7> , <T_5> now she <T_0> around all the <T_2> villages in india <T_1> other <T_6> to do the <T_4> thing .
and <T_2> has <T_0> beauty and real <T_1> power .
this <T_1> not <T_2> good , because <T_3> is <T_0> perfect <T_4> ?
the world &apos;s largest <T_4> most devastating <T_7> and <T_2> project <T_8> situated <T_1> the heart of <T_6> largest and most <T_0> forest in <T_3> world , canada &apos;s <T_5> forest .
if <T_4> prosper , <T_2> village prospers , and <T_1> so does <T_0> whole <T_3> .
so these are <T_3> kind of thoughts i <T_7> thinking <T_2> 1999 <T_5> 2000 , and <T_1> friends <T_6> me i <T_0> getting really depressed , and <T_8> were really <T_4> about me .
we <T_2> then went <T_6> look at what are these <T_4> -- <T_3> were the <T_0> triangles on <T_1> slides <T_5> .
i &apos;d <T_2> seen <T_0> reef here <T_1> .
and <T_0> idea that <T_2> is more <T_1> love , <T_3> to <T_8> , when it gets down to <T_9> neighbor , <T_7> other , it can be physical like <T_5> , <T_4> maybe in <T_6> future it will be .
when <T_9> look back now from <T_1> high <T_7> of my <T_0> age , i can <T_6> see the butchered women <T_5> children lying <T_2> and scattered all along the <T_3> gulch as <T_8> as when <T_4> saw them with eyes still young .
and <T_1> &apos;s when i discovered <T_0> .
so our <T_0> are <T_1> larger , <T_4> at the same time we are <T_2> into <T_3> directions .
so i <T_2> born on the <T_3> day <T_0> the last <T_4> of the &apos; <T_1> .
but <T_2> can only hope <T_7> &apos;ve whet your <T_8> to go out and see and learn <T_4> about the <T_0> things that <T_6> happening <T_1> art <T_3> india <T_5> .
<T_1> one had ever <T_3> this . <T_2> was 26 at the <T_0> .
so <T_2> worldwide capacity <T_3> sequence <T_4> genomes is <T_6> like 50,000 <T_5> 100,000 <T_1> genomes <T_0> year .
so , <T_0> is <T_1> for ?
the fact <T_5> it &apos;s <T_1> child &apos;s toy that <T_6> all <T_2> , but also <T_3> looks like it &apos;s <T_0> robot , <T_4> it comes <T_7> a sci-fi genus .
<T_1> those <T_2> &apos;ve <T_4> open <T_6> eyes to <T_3> third <T_7> are : a <T_8> muslim in afghanistan , a <T_5> of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a <T_0> in liberia <T_9>
so that &apos;s when i <T_6> learned <T_0> the <T_3> and had <T_4> idea <T_2> i <T_5> getting <T_1> .
if <T_2> climb these <T_1> , six <T_3> you will find <T_0> very <T_4> .
it &apos;s a space <T_5> &apos;s more <T_3> in which i present <T_1> of the <T_4> , <T_0> of other <T_6> , photographic <T_2> .
<T_3> published <T_0> results in the proceedings of <T_5> national <T_4> of <T_2> and <T_1> nature biotechnology .
<T_1> video games <T_0> violent .
and <T_5> the <T_3> three <T_7> , her <T_0> will be having sex <T_8> him <T_4> day , <T_2> a favor <T_6> getting her <T_1> school .
what &apos;s happening <T_1> costa <T_0> ?
<T_4> are <T_1> that come from <T_0> damasio &apos;s <T_7> , <T_6> which show you , in a <T_3> brain , <T_2> reconstruction of that <T_5> .
now you can <T_2> about this , if <T_0> like , as <T_1> problem <T_3> boxes .
this <T_1> practically the <T_0> of <T_2> .
<T_5> goes <T_2> this -- <T_3> &apos;ve declared <T_0> on work , as a <T_4> , all <T_1> us .
norman foster : my green <T_0> for architecture
many <T_3> are headed through <T_4> region , <T_5> is why <T_6> &apos;s been so <T_1> attention put into conservation of <T_0> eastern <T_7> pacific <T_2> .
<T_4> , again , the <T_2> view is <T_0> the <T_5> visually <T_1> what <T_3> look at .
now , my <T_3> and i had never <T_0> anything <T_6> that <T_1> our whole <T_5> . it <T_2> so <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> doctor . <T_2> &apos;s my lawyer .
so something like a prostatectomy -- the <T_5> is <T_7> , <T_8> it &apos;s in one <T_2> , and <T_3> can set <T_4> robot up <T_9> precisely <T_0> work <T_6> that one <T_1> .
alexa <T_1> : <T_2> body <T_0> my canvas
basho <T_0> a brilliant <T_1> .
<T_0> a few <T_3> , <T_2> had several newspapers in central and <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;re <T_2> safe <T_1> to come in to .
<T_0> you <T_1> this .
so <T_1> else do <T_0> require ?
<T_1> ball <T_4> us <T_2> through the rise <T_0> social consciousness <T_3> the 60s .
went <T_6> , paid <T_5> ten <T_1> , walked up -- 10 <T_4> two <T_2> , usually <T_0> good <T_3> .
<T_3> throwing <T_4> a <T_1> of <T_6> and <T_0> skill , so <T_5> &apos;s very <T_2> for that kind of whole-body training .
<T_5> you . so steve jobs had <T_9> believed in simplicity and <T_8> and <T_3> . and the truth is , for years i was a <T_0> depressed -- because <T_1> obviously did not value it , because <T_7> mac <T_4> three <T_2> market share and windows had 95 <T_6> market share .
<T_2> the rocks <T_1> , and the <T_0> step in the <T_3> of <T_4> .
<T_5> , the goal <T_2> not just <T_9> sell <T_4> people <T_7> need what you <T_6> ; the goal is to <T_8> to <T_3> who <T_1> what <T_0> believe .
<T_1> body was <T_0> in the <T_2> .
<T_1> : five of clubs . <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> the same <T_5> , even <T_0> it &apos;s the <T_2> spot .
<T_2> the <T_1> question is : <T_0> well do <T_3> work in <T_4> ?
<T_6> &apos;s going to have to be <T_4> lessening of <T_3> amount of hatred <T_1> the <T_5> , <T_0> how dangerous <T_2> &apos;s becoming .
so , <T_8> understand their <T_7> . i <T_1> disagree with it ; i <T_2> it &apos;s a very small-minded approach , the <T_9> is certainly much <T_0> global , <T_5> i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in <T_3> of a <T_6> , <T_4> we &apos;ll never know .
i <T_1> a <T_4> acorn here that <T_5> picked up <T_6> i was <T_0> on the path <T_3> this <T_2> .
and <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> unable to strike or <T_1> will self-destruct .
well <T_4> idea <T_3> that that strategy , that <T_9> strategy , is <T_1> extremely <T_6> , <T_2> strategy <T_8> getting on in <T_7> world , but <T_5> has one big <T_0> .
and this is <T_6> of the <T_7> we do it , <T_9> learning <T_4> much as we can <T_5> something so <T_1> and so iconic <T_2> the rainforests there , in order <T_8> help protect <T_3> , animals <T_0> of course the water sources .
<T_2> i <T_0> therefore able to photograph the <T_1> assembled <T_3> .
but <T_1> wasn &apos;t always <T_0> way .
it is the <T_3> for all <T_0> people <T_2> whom <T_4> is no other <T_1> coming .
and <T_1> it &apos;s even more <T_2> , they <T_0> their <T_3> out .
i &apos;m a game designer , so i have <T_0> stuff sitting around my <T_1> .
<T_7> what you <T_2> , <T_9> else , the <T_1> states , <T_0> hub of <T_5> around the <T_3> , they don &apos;t <T_4> to really be <T_6> democratic countries all around <T_8> world .
<T_1> just do <T_2> to make <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s doing <T_1> new . there &apos;s new <T_0> happening .
it <T_0> like <T_1> because , of <T_3> , <T_2> is .
<T_2> this is so <T_3> , <T_4> this is <T_1> a no-brainer , <T_0> of this do we have ?
<T_1> patrollers <T_0> foragers .
and <T_5> of it is <T_7> personal <T_4> . <T_9> chris invited <T_2> to <T_1> , he <T_6> , <T_8> think of you as a bit of an <T_3> , and they want to know what <T_0> you a bit .
they <T_1> ? what <T_0> yours ?
so <T_2> i did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at <T_4> location on <T_6> at the time of the <T_0> of the <T_7> , all right , it <T_5> well past the end of civil <T_9> and <T_3> was <T_1> moon up that <T_8> .
<T_4> , so you <T_0> 30 <T_1> now to solve <T_2> 15 <T_3> .
he &apos;s clearly been <T_0> a <T_2> for the <T_1> 20,000 years .
i mean , obviously , it &apos;s got some <T_1> offensive , obscene content on it , just <T_0> terms of <T_2> alone .
can <T_0> imagine saying <T_1> ?
<T_5> are <T_3> first <T_6> to be <T_0> in <T_1> world <T_4> we don &apos;t worship anything other than <T_2> .
<T_1> it can <T_2> its environment , and <T_3> it can <T_0> its environment and disappear .
<T_1> blocks <T_0> leds .
i &apos;ve <T_0> been fascinated with <T_1> the self .
<T_5> live <T_4> the street from an historic <T_2> that had lost <T_3> very iconic <T_0> in the <T_1> .
lennart <T_1> : <T_2> -- <T_0> .
<T_0> beautiful canvas <T_4> rubber skylights got <T_3> by the <T_1> in <T_2> months .
if i wanted to know , for <T_3> , <T_9> many stars were in <T_6> milky way , <T_4> old <T_1> giant heads <T_7> easter <T_8> were , most <T_2> you could find <T_5> out right now without <T_0> standing up .
<T_5> : does <T_4> mean that some day <T_0> could download <T_2> and <T_3> upload <T_1> ?
<T_2> that <T_0> fellow who sells cloth , for example , will be selling <T_1> .
as <T_0> globe <T_8> , we <T_3> see <T_4> location , <T_5> we can open the <T_6> and swipe <T_2> the chapters to <T_1> the <T_7> .
<T_2> net <T_1> doing the work in <T_0> brain .
and it &apos;s <T_2> , although <T_1> brain <T_3> very complicated , <T_4> look <T_5> until <T_0> understand them .
what we <T_5> is a <T_2> field guide to the <T_1> that live in <T_0> on <T_7> , so <T_3> we <T_4> understand what they &apos;re doing to our <T_6> .
so it would be able to <T_1> the <T_2> that is on <T_0> dvd .
if someone came to my door and i was <T_7> catholic theology <T_5> dogma for the very first time , and they said , &quot; we believe <T_9> god impregnated <T_8> very young girl without the use of <T_2> , <T_0> the fact that she was a virgin is <T_6> important to us -- -- and she had <T_4> baby , and that &apos;s the son of god , &quot; i mean , <T_1> would think <T_3> &apos;s equally ridiculous .
<T_0> furniture is designed <T_5> that children <T_2> sit in front of <T_6> , <T_1> screens , big <T_3> connections , <T_7> in <T_4> .
<T_1> looks pretty <T_2> at this <T_0> .
<T_0> should <T_1> ideas be <T_2> ?
this picture <T_3> shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people <T_9> pay a <T_6> of money to get on <T_5> boat , go to a place off of key west in florida , drink a <T_1> of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , <T_4> back with the biggest <T_8> the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , <T_7> this <T_0> is <T_2> really excited about that fish .
<T_0> would you have predicted , not knowing <T_1> ?
so <T_6> showed <T_5> this , <T_8> this <T_7> actual <T_0> that he <T_2> on . <T_3> is <T_1> 15 . this was his <T_4> .
<T_4> are <T_5> in a <T_0> that <T_3> different from that of the <T_1> life that <T_2> &apos;re used to .
and now <T_2> &apos;s going to do <T_1> darpa asked <T_0> for .
<T_4> basically , what <T_1> focuses on is saying , we can do a <T_0> more by <T_2> in <T_3> .
there is also a <T_2> weak force <T_3> , <T_4> unimaginatively , the <T_5> force , <T_6> interacts <T_1> with left-handed <T_0> .
the <T_1> soldier also <T_0> .
<T_7> shared <T_2> with <T_0> , <T_4> responsibility for <T_5> failure of his subordinates , constantly acknowledged <T_3> errors <T_1> learned from <T_6> mistakes .
and <T_0> raised his <T_4> of raki to me <T_1> said , &quot; <T_3> , <T_5> . <T_2> . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s see <T_2> happens if we do two <T_4> with <T_3> triangle , one <T_1> the <T_5> .
they <T_2> these <T_1> shifts in your <T_0> activity .
and <T_0> &apos;m <T_1> talking about <T_2> god thing .
what <T_0> want to talk <T_2> is , as <T_4> , <T_5> the <T_1> that cars are <T_3> .
end of <T_0> day , <T_2> &apos;s ready for <T_1> remarks .
so , <T_0> a month for the <T_9> year , i &apos;ve been doing a column called &quot; the <T_2> of uncertainty , &quot; <T_8> , you know , <T_1> don &apos;t know who <T_5> is , <T_4> i <T_3> i can throw <T_6> around now . you know , it &apos;s the principles <T_7> uncertainty , so , you know .
<T_3> are led <T_2> that help <T_5> roughly billion <T_7> out there , for <T_1> nightfall <T_6> darkness , to have a <T_4> means <T_0> operating .
at all times , i <T_5> operate <T_0> a different <T_2> and <T_4> from <T_6> , while i <T_3> the <T_1> that i &apos;m tapped into <T_8> in <T_7> time .
and <T_3> reason she <T_0> her <T_2> is <T_5> this six-year-old <T_7> had been teaching her mother <T_1> to <T_4> and <T_6> .
<T_3> person is <T_1> to have <T_0> form of <T_2> .
and <T_3> we have <T_8> eight billion <T_0> seven billion , or <T_6> billion , even , people , living on a <T_4> where their cities also <T_1> the <T_5> , <T_7> &apos;re going to run out of <T_2> really fast .
<T_1> , there <T_0> many <T_2> .
and <T_0> world <T_1> full of non-zero-sum dynamics .
<T_2> is the <T_0> we &apos;re <T_3> -- <T_1> last <T_4> .
<T_1> of the things that happens is that <T_2> applies for <T_0> scholarship .
<T_3> third , <T_0> this <T_2> much <T_1> ?
so , what , <T_2> wanted to <T_0> , could explain <T_1> anomaly ?
<T_1> that -- forget the <T_2> , forget the moving <T_0> of <T_4> -- that stuff &apos;s <T_3> .
<T_2> the siwa oasis <T_7> famous for <T_5> things , <T_4> the key thing is that <T_9> was the place that <T_0> the <T_3> went to when <T_6> wanted to find out <T_8> his destiny had in store <T_1> him .
<T_2> expected <T_4> to <T_7> incoherent , but , in fact , he <T_6> into the <T_8> and said <T_1> me , &quot; <T_5> , ken . <T_3> should <T_0> sit ? &quot;
this is <T_1> for <T_0> the <T_4> fights <T_3> we &apos;re going to be <T_2> .
<T_2> have <T_3> that we can <T_0> believe in <T_4> god who <T_1> our pain .
i <T_4> choose these <T_2> paths out of <T_0> infinite <T_1> of <T_3> .
<T_1> i think that we <T_5> to be <T_4> aware of , <T_0> we <T_3> to find the risk-benefit <T_2> .
and <T_2> each one <T_3> you sends it to <T_4> or 400 <T_5> , <T_1> would be <T_0> .
<T_2> we measured <T_3> much <T_1> were willing <T_0> pay for it .
now , the <T_2> system <T_1> product-service <T_0> .
so <T_2> wonder , <T_4> if cities could give to <T_0> pedestrians what <T_3> take <T_5> granted as we now go <T_1> cities ?
<T_1> &apos;ll give you a <T_0> of <T_2> it works .
<T_3> it is in <T_0> three that <T_1> of <T_2> move .
we started <T_4> with <T_0> local telecom <T_1> called <T_2> , which is a <T_3> of trilogy <T_5> .
and then aboriginal <T_1> in <T_3> would come <T_0> say , &quot; this <T_2> it ! &quot;
but <T_0> was <T_4> to give a talk at <T_3> conference in <T_1> a <T_2> years back .
<T_2> : i <T_1> a <T_0> .
to put it <T_1> , <T_0> didn &apos;t do very <T_2> .
well <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> because <T_0> are very <T_2> to <T_1> from other materials and <T_3> one another .
what &apos;s <T_1> : <T_0> .
and <T_1> reason that it &apos;s <T_4> very successful <T_0> it &apos;s <T_7> , <T_6> &apos;s <T_3> , <T_5> &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s <T_2> .
if you want to make a dinosaur , you go out , you <T_7> yourself a piece of <T_4> -- otherwise known as amber <T_9> that <T_2> some blood-sucking <T_0> in it , good ones , <T_6> you get your insect and you drill into it <T_8> you suck out <T_1> dna , because obviously <T_5> insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out .
the other <T_1> principle of evolution <T_2> sexual selection , <T_3> it <T_0> very <T_4> .
<T_3> , <T_2> , unsubstantiated <T_0> simply <T_1> &apos;t do .
in the <T_0> of my <T_2> , <T_6> turned 40 and i began <T_3> hate <T_5> body , <T_8> was actually progress , <T_7> at least <T_1> body existed <T_4> to <T_9> it .
it &apos;s <T_5> how many <T_0> do you get per <T_1> , <T_4> how could <T_7> benefit from that <T_3> that power to <T_6> your <T_2> in some way .
<T_1> , <T_4> &apos;ve got to <T_0> you , <T_3> &apos;s just not going to be <T_2> .
<T_1> were trying to fill <T_2> dad-space in <T_0> girls &apos; lives .
he <T_1> &apos;t content with the way <T_0> newspapers published it to be <T_3> . he <T_2> it all out there <T_4>
<T_0> carried on sailing <T_2> the <T_1> towards the north <T_3>
<T_5> you look <T_2> that , <T_4> look to the <T_0> , or you look inside <T_1> you are very <T_3> , inside <T_6> .
<T_2> a result of <T_0> talking so much <T_7> my <T_6> , many women started to tell <T_3> about <T_5> -- their <T_1> about <T_4> bodies .
<T_1> decisions are <T_0> a <T_3> of <T_2> actor &apos;s policy .
only <T_0> wasn &apos;t the word <T_1> used .
and i <T_8> abandoned <T_6> book , and <T_2> chris called me <T_7> talk at <T_4> conference . <T_9> really don &apos;t talk about this anymore <T_3> , you <T_1> , there &apos;s enough <T_5> and depressing <T_0> going on .
<T_0> ocean <T_2> would have a <T_1> to it .
they <T_5> to say <T_3> pen is mightier than the <T_2> . <T_0> think <T_1> camera <T_4> .
for <T_3> , at <T_8> now for <T_5> 20 <T_2> , <T_6> has <T_7> been a <T_0> where there was more excitement about <T_9> potential that <T_1> in <T_4> of us .
<T_1> want to be looking <T_0> .
and i did a <T_4> down to 160 <T_2> , which is basically the <T_3> of a 16 story <T_1> , <T_8> as i was <T_6> up , i <T_5> out underwater , <T_0> is really <T_9> ; that &apos;s how you <T_7> .
<T_7> &apos;s <T_1> , but <T_0> astonishing thing <T_9> , the patient then says , &quot; <T_4> my <T_3> , <T_5> phantom is <T_2> again , and the pain , <T_6> clenching <T_8> , is relieved . &quot;
<T_3> they &apos;d <T_1> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_0> they want to <T_4> . &quot;
what if my roommate knew <T_1> contemporary nigerian <T_5> , <T_4> people singing in <T_8> and pidgin , and igbo <T_0> yoruba and <T_2> , <T_6> influences from jay-z to <T_9> to bob <T_7> to <T_3> grandfathers .
<T_3> know <T_0> you <T_2> grab <T_1> things with them .
and <T_0> of the <T_3> of all time , james <T_5> &apos;s steam engine of <T_4> was <T_1> major , major <T_2> .
this <T_0> indeed important , <T_7> everyone <T_1> that <T_5> is some sort of <T_3> on <T_2> many people <T_6> can be on <T_4> planet .
and <T_0> worked hard , and we thought <T_2> it <T_7> we <T_1> , &quot; what &apos;s something we <T_4> use all the time , that we <T_6> use <T_5> the medical care system , that <T_3> will understand ? &quot;
he was <T_1> , &quot; why ? <T_4> know , you &apos;re <T_2> , <T_5> have all <T_0> things going <T_3> you . &quot;
now , <T_1> engineering approach to this , the ai approach to this , is to build <T_2> door database . <T_3> has all <T_0> door attributes .
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> most important economic <T_0> of our <T_1> .
and <T_1> remember this one <T_2> so vividly <T_4> i <T_3> did some other stuff <T_0> these <T_5> .
<T_0> get <T_1> in .
<T_0> give <T_2> , and <T_3> get about 40 <T_4> 50 <T_1> a day .
<T_0> are <T_2> doing all of these <T_1> and why are we <T_3> them ?
<T_4> because it was being produced <T_5> , <T_1> if it <T_3> plastic , food <T_2> magical <T_0> poisonous powers , or <T_6> .
<T_5> that hospital was over <T_7> hours <T_3> , <T_4> sevitha <T_0> &apos;t have the <T_2> to <T_6> there , so <T_1> baby died .
<T_2> changes that allowed us to do that , the evolution <T_0> this highly adaptable <T_5> that we all carry around with us , allowing <T_6> to create novel <T_7> , allowing <T_1> to develop <T_8> diversity that <T_3> see on a whirlwind <T_9> like the one <T_4> &apos;ve just been on .
and yet , why <T_7> there be <T_0> much variation in quality and in <T_3> , and <T_2> was the <T_5> principle <T_6> we <T_1> when <T_4> designed the <T_8> systems .
<T_3> they learn how to stay <T_0> , they grew in <T_2> and <T_1> .
and <T_4> we &apos;re going to <T_2> that , <T_7> need to pull <T_8> from <T_3> bottom , and <T_5> need to pull <T_1> from the <T_6> of <T_0> graph .
<T_6> he <T_0> &apos;t really mean <T_1> . he means <T_3> , which is -- -- like a <T_4> seat <T_2> the <T_5> .
<T_4> we &apos;re willing <T_0> in deception <T_1> the sake of social <T_6> , <T_2> to keep <T_5> secret <T_3> should be kept secret , secret .
built <T_0> tesla coil . this <T_2> was built <T_3> long <T_4> back <T_5> the beginning of <T_1> 1900s .
<T_1> last painting <T_4> &apos;m going to talk about is <T_3> &quot; <T_2> &quot; <T_0> anonymous .
this is <T_2> we want to get , though , in <T_0> next <T_1> years .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> example from chicago <T_0> .
<T_6> of the <T_5> points <T_3> to reform the <T_0> so that <T_2> have <T_1> practices on <T_4> ground .
<T_8> what we <T_6> , <T_2> many people &apos;s surprise , was <T_1> those linkedin résumés were more <T_0> on the <T_4> that mattered to <T_9> , like your <T_5> or your skills <T_3> your previous <T_7> .
so what it actually does , it locks <T_0> strands , <T_2> are called fluxons , <T_3> it locks these fluxons in <T_1> .
<T_2> he <T_4> , &quot; don &apos;t <T_3> . &quot; <T_1> was <T_5> that <T_0> would be safe .
<T_6> certainly would <T_5> to know what happened <T_3> the person who <T_1> that <T_8> back then , <T_7> they <T_0> followed it <T_2> its ultimate <T_4> .
<T_4> when <T_5> gave them to <T_0> people , <T_7> &apos;d either hold them to <T_3> heart , or they &apos;d hold them up <T_1> their <T_6> and just stay <T_2> .
does <T_1> have cumulative <T_0> ?
<T_0> say &quot; <T_1> ...
i <T_2> , <T_0> you become more <T_5> , <T_4> , by <T_1> for <T_3> ?
&quot; <T_2> &apos;ve been around <T_4> 36 <T_0> , <T_3> this <T_1> it ? &quot;
and <T_2> third user <T_0> , in thailand , is <T_1> elephants . go ahead , <T_3> .
<T_1> : and <T_0> forwards and backwards ? <T_2> : <T_3> .
but <T_0> &apos;ve become totally disconnected <T_1> them .
<T_4> therefore , <T_5> in turn meant that there was <T_1> extremely <T_6> bunch of <T_2> who arrived in <T_3> various <T_0> institutions .
<T_0> &apos;s an <T_4> of the <T_2> thing on <T_1> finger , <T_3> you basically <T_5> it <T_6> like .
so <T_2> was <T_0> of their <T_1> .
<T_1> fun with that . <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> exciting .
basically <T_0> .
they <T_0> a highly <T_1> species .
so now <T_4> know what i <T_2> that is moving <T_0> to <T_3> this <T_1> .
<T_4> historian bahia shehab has <T_3> been fascinated with the <T_7> script for &apos; <T_9> . &apos; when <T_6> swept through egypt in <T_1> , she <T_0> spraying the image <T_2> the streets <T_5> no to dictators , no to military rule and no to <T_8> .
it <T_1> so easy <T_2> nobody could <T_6> cake to their <T_0> and <T_5> , &quot; <T_4> is my <T_3> . &quot;
all <T_4> have to do <T_5> to get <T_2> egos out of <T_3> way , get <T_1> egotism out of <T_0> way .
<T_1> you very <T_0> .
<T_1> , he <T_0> happy .
mm <T_2> one , <T_1> , three . <T_0> !
it <T_3> like a fairly <T_0> thing , but <T_1> was a half <T_2> million dollar project ?
they <T_1> sit <T_3> feet in <T_2> of the world &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_4> our brains -- <T_3> celebrated <T_0> -- <T_1> a <T_5> of a tidal <T_2> .
so <T_7> doctor sees <T_0> difference between <T_4> yellow bar and the blue bar , and <T_1> says , &quot; <T_5> , <T_3> need to give her <T_2> , medication <T_6> inhalers . &quot;
and <T_2> of this seems to <T_0> to be a salient point <T_1> history .
this <T_2> another <T_5> , single <T_4> , dipped <T_1> a bigger <T_3> that self-folds into <T_0> cube , a three-dimensional structure , on its own .
so let &apos;s <T_0> again . let &apos;s design a <T_2> , <T_4> from the <T_5> go , and <T_3> what <T_1> want .
back in the <T_1> of the <T_3> presented <T_2> this chart , china was the <T_0> &apos;s high-technology leader .
by <T_0> , electric <T_2> was <T_1> .
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> unfair towards the <T_0> .
<T_3> saw examples <T_2> that . once <T_1> identified this <T_4> , <T_0> was all <T_5> the place .
<T_5> what if <T_0> was really <T_7> quality of life <T_2> about perhaps <T_9> that <T_6> would all enjoy <T_3> , <T_4> that would be <T_8> than <T_1> we have right now ?
<T_5> teacher sets <T_1> process <T_4> motion <T_2> then she stands back in awe and <T_0> as <T_3> happens .
and <T_0> lost his <T_4> , his <T_2> , his <T_1> and <T_3> upper jaw and teeth .
<T_7> were also playing <T_1> sms at the time at odeo , so <T_5> kind of put <T_0> and <T_2> together , <T_3> in <T_9> 2006 we launched <T_4> as <T_8> side project <T_6> odeo .
and just little bits and <T_1> , <T_2> you <T_0> see some of the things there .
<T_0> if <T_2> is in <T_1> ?
the director , standing behind <T_0> set of shelves , is <T_8> to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s <T_4> going to ask you to move <T_3> that <T_9> can &apos;t see . <T_2> introduces <T_5> really interesting condition <T_7> there &apos;s a kind of <T_6> between your <T_1> and the director &apos;s perspective .
how <T_1> we create public <T_0> ?
now , any of you <T_4> are <T_6> anything about <T_3> lately might <T_5> , &quot; <T_0> , <T_2> idea , but <T_1> ?
<T_1> mentioned <T_0> before .
palais <T_0> sports , the <T_2> de <T_1> over <T_3> .
now i &apos;m not supposed to <T_3> that with you , <T_2> i have to <T_0> you the card <T_1> hidden in the back of the <T_4> .
<T_1> play , that &apos;s a <T_0> thing . &quot;
<T_8> , mental illnesses are also very <T_0> to <T_6> &apos;s <T_7> , <T_1> beyond just the burden <T_3> disease , let <T_4> consider <T_2> absolute <T_5> .
<T_4> , <T_2> next <T_1> i &apos;m about <T_5> show you -- <T_0> i just turn <T_3> off ?
so the planet <T_0> a pretty amazing thing , you know , <T_5> &apos;s <T_2> and <T_4> -- and big <T_3> wonderful , <T_1> it does <T_7> kinds <T_6> things <T_8> don &apos;t <T_9> anything about .
these <T_0> crevasses open <T_1> .
and they did <T_7> by <T_3> observations <T_1> numerous distant galaxies , <T_2> them <T_5> chart <T_0> the <T_6> rate has <T_4> over time .
and <T_0> was asked <T_5> just by that guy but by everyone <T_2> the <T_8> , <T_3> frankly , by every worker at one <T_6> 50,000 <T_4> that closed <T_7> the first <T_9> of <T_1> century .
but <T_4> atoms <T_5> to join together , small <T_1> want to <T_2> together to <T_0> bigger ones <T_3> go towards <T_6> .
<T_6> may take <T_0> days , three <T_9> , four <T_5> , <T_2> they <T_7> &apos;t rest <T_8> they find a <T_1> , <T_4> better yet , <T_3> reconciliation .
now let &apos;s <T_1> you &apos;re having that <T_2> same conversation <T_0> someone <T_3> .
<T_8> -- when <T_0> spoke to mr. gore the other <T_1> after <T_3> , <T_2> asked him <T_4> environmental justice activists <T_6> be included in his <T_5> marketing strategy . <T_7>
<T_1> i &apos;d like to <T_0> at the very <T_2> .
so , in <T_6> , giuseppe coccone <T_2> philip <T_4> published the <T_5> seti article in <T_0> refereed journal , and brought <T_7> into <T_1> scientific <T_3> .
<T_7> years <T_1> you could <T_2> have found a <T_6> sober economist <T_3> on planet <T_5> who would have predicted <T_0> wikipedia <T_4> .
<T_2> the point here is <T_7> when <T_1> get the <T_0> russian <T_3> online , what <T_8> get people to <T_6> internet <T_9> not going to be <T_5> reports <T_4> human rights watch .
it &apos;s essentially a <T_1> , a <T_0> .
what <T_2> generic <T_0> space into <T_1> space ?
<T_4> kahle is building a truly <T_3> digital library -- <T_5> book ever published , every <T_1> ever released , all the strata of web <T_7> ... <T_8> &apos;s all <T_6> to the <T_0> -- <T_2> someone <T_9> gets to it first .
they &apos;re actually spending <T_2> on their car <T_4> fuel <T_3> they are on <T_1> or on <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ve been <T_0> topsoil .
bf : i <T_0> i <T_3> the hard <T_2> . <T_1> .
<T_8> became <T_7> curious about <T_4> poets after <T_9> six years with <T_1> , and started <T_3> research their <T_5> , <T_0> then <T_2> to write a <T_6> about it .
and you <T_8> &apos;t come <T_6> this . this <T_3> purely for <T_0> community that <T_4> sweating using nike <T_1> . <T_5> can &apos;t <T_2> stuff <T_7> pesos .
<T_0> ? air quality was <T_2> reason they used natural gas and got away from <T_1> .
<T_1> if we want to think <T_6> a way of getting a taste of that kind of <T_7> consciousness as <T_0> , i <T_2> the <T_5> thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in <T_3> new situation that we &apos;ve <T_9> been in before -- when <T_8> fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in <T_4> new city for the first time .
<T_4> if you have <T_5> system where they &apos;re being <T_2> one by the other , <T_7> &apos;s <T_6> the <T_3> writing <T_1> a <T_0> .
<T_7> people , i <T_1> , <T_3> our <T_2> right now <T_8> , and they <T_4> we &apos;ve <T_6> a point <T_0> we &apos;ve <T_5> most of the things .
and we &apos;ve seen <T_0> seminal <T_1> .
<T_4> -- and <T_0> &apos;s <T_9> of , perhaps romantic , but <T_2> think beautiful , <T_5> you just <T_6> something to <T_8> on to , <T_3> in a <T_7> where you <T_1> alienated .
so <T_0> have a huge amount of <T_1> to make .
<T_0> new <T_3> ceo believed <T_2> the <T_1> of positive pr ...
<T_2> you have it <T_1> planets <T_0> asteroids .
you <T_0> . <T_7> doesn &apos;t take <T_1> before <T_2> guys here -- this <T_6> and one <T_5> will show up over <T_4> -- start to <T_3> .
<T_0> it &apos;s important to <T_4> igbo is <T_7> tonal <T_9> , and <T_8> they &apos;ll say the word &quot; <T_1> &quot; <T_5> &quot; <T_3> &quot; : same <T_6> , <T_2> means &quot; sky &quot; or &quot; heaven , &quot; and one means &quot; bicycle &quot; or &quot; iron . &quot;
<T_0> i have <T_1> dream .
communication is <T_3> important for <T_0> -- <T_2> transform the <T_1> .
<T_0> first <T_7> of <T_5> school <T_4> the struggle of <T_2> manic episode , and <T_9> second half was <T_3> overmedications of <T_1> drugs , <T_6> i was sleeping through high <T_8> .
<T_2> you <T_4> see <T_0> , from ballmer &apos;s <T_1> of view , that &apos;s a <T_3> idea , <T_5> ?
and <T_7> &apos;m going to <T_1> you <T_3> system that <T_6> designed to model <T_2> retina , which is a <T_8> of <T_5> that lines <T_4> inside of <T_0> eyeball .
<T_2> : i am more <T_0> my <T_1> .
we <T_6> a <T_5> . <T_3> one <T_1> us in this room , we have a <T_7> as to <T_4> kind of <T_2> we <T_0> to make .
<T_1> it needed a very <T_0> front <T_2> .
<T_5> there <T_4> companies <T_0> do to <T_3> their employees <T_1> less pressed <T_2> time ? yes .
this is when i was <T_0> texas .
<T_4> the <T_3> was <T_2> biggest <T_0> that ever <T_1> made by man .
and <T_4> of those <T_1> were reviewed <T_3> another 400-plus <T_2> and reviewers , <T_0> 113 <T_5> .
sub-saharan africa , <T_2> even <T_1> own san <T_0> bay area .
now <T_4> bloodline <T_0> numerous <T_1> portraits , <T_5> a complex relationship <T_3> one &apos;s <T_2> history .
<T_0> is my <T_1> trip , my <T_2> foreign trip <T_3> a first <T_4> .
unlike , for example <T_1> , <T_0> audiences cough <T_2> the time .
<T_5> final <T_4> is <T_0> notion of <T_1> as a single market -- because <T_6> you didn &apos;t think of <T_2> as a <T_8> , <T_7> didn &apos;t really <T_3> a single market <T_9> because it didn &apos;t really matter .
when <T_2> think <T_3> ideas in that <T_1> , we usually <T_0> about <T_4> .
<T_2> his date was <T_0> go with him to a community <T_1> .
<T_6> you have to update your <T_0> based on the signals coming back , <T_5> you have to do something that is <T_2> , which is <T_3> have to do <T_4> kind of <T_7> of <T_1> assay .
one of <T_1> is <T_3> labeled &quot; <T_2> technical <T_0> . &quot;
so , madantusi <T_2> to show <T_6> language is <T_5> a barrier ; in <T_0> they may be able to <T_1> themselves <T_7> language <T_4> they <T_3> wanted to .
so <T_1> for <T_3> &quot; <T_2> gleam <T_0> happiness . &quot;
<T_1> it &apos;s 60 <T_0> old .
and the <T_6> , the <T_9> age <T_2> appliances really <T_7> -- <T_8> depends how you <T_5> to measure it -- <T_0> it &apos;s anywhere from <T_4> to 60 <T_1> . it goes on a long <T_3> .
and i &apos;m making the <T_4> of the <T_0> proportional to <T_2> amount of money that <T_1> spent on <T_3> .
i <T_4> began to <T_8> , <T_3> i had <T_9> times before , how <T_5> life would have been <T_2> had this <T_0> not <T_6> me , had my genes been fed a <T_7> helping <T_1> experience .
i &apos;m <T_0> for <T_2> for other <T_1> to be with me .
so in <T_4> philippines <T_1> , parents <T_5> students can <T_8> real-time feedback on <T_7> website , checkmyschool.org , <T_9> using sms , whether <T_6> and textbooks are showing <T_2> in school , the same problems i witnessed <T_3> uganda <T_0> in bihar .
<T_0> how <T_3> that <T_4> be , <T_1> we <T_2> it .
so i <T_0> i &apos;ve convinced you <T_2> brain is <T_3> and <T_1> to control <T_4> .
and over the years , <T_1> the turn <T_9> the 20th century , it <T_6> to take on this other <T_3> of deception -- this <T_4> for any artificial interest <T_7> , or association with , <T_0> object through <T_5> it <T_8> delusively magnified or <T_2> .
<T_2> impatients <T_3> very <T_1> for water quality <T_0> air quality .
<T_1> &apos;ve never made <T_0> .
before <T_0> , <T_3> , technology didn &apos;t exist . <T_2> obviously it <T_1> .
he <T_0> his <T_2> data , he publishes it <T_1> he holds <T_4> contest on the <T_3> called the goldcorp challenge .
<T_5> we think <T_3> solutions to <T_2> , <T_1> cannot <T_4> individuals their <T_0> dignity .
<T_1> what <T_3> mean by that , it &apos;s <T_0> behaviors that <T_4> &apos;re in <T_7> about , and <T_5> ones <T_8> operate below <T_6> surface of <T_2> daily awareness .
<T_5> cost <T_4> heart failure is <T_1> billion <T_2> a year , which is 80 <T_0> related to <T_3> .
thank you .
&quot; <T_0> need to <T_1> companies . &quot;
<T_0> can calculate <T_1> price of <T_2> water .
discoveries <T_2> fire <T_0> so <T_4> , <T_5> from <T_3> individual &apos;s point of view , the world <T_1> improved .
so when <T_0> do my <T_2> , <T_1> hate <T_3> .
<T_2> . so , <T_0> music : <T_3> and <T_1> .

and <T_5> , by the way , are <T_7> only creatures capable of <T_1> about <T_3> future in this <T_4> , of projecting <T_9> forward <T_6> time , and this mental time <T_2> is just one more thing that <T_8> have in common with <T_0> .
and another program <T_3> statistical probability <T_9> then <T_6> mathematical <T_5> to determine <T_1> any of these <T_8> are clinically significant , <T_0> us to provide <T_7> much more <T_2> neurological <T_4> of the child &apos;s symptoms .

<T_0> &apos;s <T_3> , as <T_1> popper put <T_2> , theory-laden .
<T_0> character <T_4> jami <T_2> the <T_3> to create <T_1> inventions .
<T_0> , <T_3> kids get to be <T_6> third <T_2> fourth <T_9> , <T_5> might see that this <T_4> &apos;s going to be a visual thinker , <T_7> in perspective . now , i <T_8> to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a <T_1> thinker .
<T_7> friend <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> , <T_6> because it <T_4> looks as <T_2> the sun <T_3> going round <T_5> earth . &quot;
<T_2> is people moving <T_1> , <T_0> &apos;s even <T_3> .
<T_1> : <T_3> ! <T_0> : hoping <T_2> a little more build .
<T_7> here <T_6> have a <T_2> of <T_3> where rather than having <T_5> go over the linear <T_0> , we have it coming <T_1> from the <T_4> .
so <T_5> &apos;m currently working on <T_9> book , which plays <T_8> both <T_6> of the word , as i <T_0> some of my own <T_2> and inquiries <T_3> a <T_1> display <T_4> rather peacock-like <T_7> .
so the <T_3> have <T_2> own <T_0> , and <T_1> have your <T_4> parachutes .
i <T_4> &apos;t need to be <T_0> anymore <T_2> know <T_1> to <T_5> the <T_3> .
<T_5> , <T_3> a <T_1> social system <T_6> a <T_4> hard thing to do , and let <T_2> tell you a <T_0> .
j here is <T_4> ted <T_8> wish : <T_9> wish that <T_0> &apos;ll help to create and document a <T_7> training program for 50 <T_6> young musicians , passionate about their art and social <T_5> , and <T_1> to bringing el <T_2> to the <T_3> and other countries .
you may or may not <T_1> noticed <T_3> i &apos;m wearing <T_0> tiny <T_4> on <T_2> forehead .
you <T_0> &apos;t just tell <T_2> one <T_1> story .
<T_0> mattered to <T_1> .
so <T_3> we need <T_0> figure out how <T_2> build consent of <T_1> networked .
chinese <T_0> have <T_5> largely the same thing , i would <T_7> , with <T_3> menu and the <T_1> -- <T_8> the <T_2> name -- but <T_6> a centralized <T_4> .
but <T_9> now , most of <T_0> companies involved in <T_3> supply chains don &apos;t have any way of <T_2> us that <T_4> had to mortgage their <T_5> , nobody <T_8> to sacrifice <T_6> rights to bring us <T_7> favorite brand name <T_1> .
<T_1> need <T_3> low-key <T_2> that <T_0> the <T_6> of <T_4> large-scale mechanization that we &apos;ve <T_5> .
the final <T_0> takes place <T_2> stage <T_1> .
some <T_1> are <T_0> at <T_3> threshold of <T_2> visibility .
and , all of a <T_0> , <T_1> paintings came <T_2> .
that <T_5> i <T_4> this client once , <T_9> every <T_1> i get <T_3> by <T_6> person , that &apos;s <T_0> better <T_8> sell one <T_2> thing to one <T_7> .
<T_2> , <T_0> to home , <T_3> , <T_4> n.g. road <T_1> bangalore .
and that might be <T_2> in <T_0> nervous , dangerous <T_1> .
and there are a <T_2> billion <T_5> in that <T_1> , just <T_3> give you <T_0> sense of <T_4> .
<T_5> next <T_2> that is going to come up is <T_1> example <T_3> a kind of <T_4> that is <T_0> complex .
<T_1> was just <T_2> part of <T_0> process .
<T_5> was <T_1> in ancient <T_2> , at the <T_0> of the world , <T_6> a <T_3> catholic and <T_4> family .
<T_1> have to do <T_0> buildings .
in my <T_4> , <T_0> way of transcending <T_3> cultural <T_5> is through <T_1> art of <T_2> .
people never want <T_2> say , i really <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> .
and even <T_5> , <T_4> we <T_2> thought wasn <T_8> that <T_7> a <T_1> , mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly <T_9> chance of renal <T_0> , needing dialysis <T_3> age 40 <T_6>
by <T_2> age of <T_3> or <T_1> , they &apos;d become beggars <T_0> drug <T_4> .
these <T_0> sea lions in <T_1> doing <T_4> own dance , <T_2> david <T_3> .
whatever <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;t give <T_0> .
<T_0> location of <T_2> tree <T_3> actually kept <T_1> for its own protection .
<T_0> i brought <T_1> of those as well <T_3> you can <T_4> outside <T_2> .
so , <T_2> whole <T_0> is so <T_1> .
<T_4> , <T_6> century <T_2> , <T_0> researchers <T_1> to <T_3> neurons , <T_7> light them up from the inside rather than <T_5> them .
<T_5> this brings <T_6> to my wish for <T_2> , <T_3> to <T_4> else around the <T_1> who hears <T_0> talk .
<T_1> also , don &apos;t <T_0> .
so <T_9> 15-year-old <T_8> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> , and she &apos;s <T_1> charlotte , and i asked <T_0> to record <T_5> , <T_7> i worked with a <T_3> called elliot to put <T_6> beats together .
and <T_2> can look at the <T_1> , not <T_0> the <T_3> .
and <T_1> texting actually <T_2> evidence <T_5> a <T_3> act <T_0> young people are using today , not <T_4> , of <T_9> , <T_6> it &apos;s <T_8> expansion of their <T_7> repertoire .
<T_1> &apos;d <T_0> to end with <T_2> little metaphor here .
<T_0> do <T_1> feed a city ?
<T_1> get out <T_0> handkerchiefs <T_2> .
<T_5> you <T_6> have <T_7> , i &apos;m a tissue engineer , and this <T_0> a video <T_3> some <T_4> the <T_1> heart that <T_2> &apos;ve <T_8> in the lab .
it <T_3> time for a <T_5> revolution , <T_4> they pledged to bring about , <T_1> what &apos;s so amazing about <T_8> guys <T_6> , <T_9> only did they have these <T_0> undergraduate dreams , but they actually carried them out , <T_2> beyond their <T_7> dreams .
fish <T_2> chips in <T_4> , the cornish <T_3> , the <T_0> , the <T_1> .
<T_2> we know <T_0> to <T_4> , <T_1> just need to do <T_3> ?
<T_3> have landed <T_0> rocket ship <T_2> an <T_4> . it &apos;s not <T_1> big deal .
and <T_0> said , &quot; well , <T_1> many people <T_2> at <T_3> ? &quot;
i couldn &apos;t leave the <T_1> , and <T_4> couldn &apos;t leave <T_7> topic either , because everywhere <T_0> met more of these women who <T_8> one <T_5> to know <T_2> , or even <T_3> to <T_6>
<T_1> times was deluged <T_0> criticism .
and <T_4> , it &apos;s in terms <T_3> the very <T_1> emotional <T_0> that <T_6> offers to <T_2> both <T_5> and collectively .
and <T_2> i told <T_0> , &quot; i <T_1> to be a teacher . &quot;
<T_7> , <T_6> can &apos;t <T_4> , but we <T_0> be <T_3> sure <T_2> some form <T_5> symbolic <T_1> must have been involved .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> son , oliver .
<T_1> couldn &apos;t match it up to <T_3> bones on the <T_0> , <T_2> he said , <T_6> ! <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> .
<T_4> i <T_1> through everything <T_3> radio transceivers <T_2> funnels <T_0> plastic tubing .
and my <T_1> , brave lady , <T_6> partly to blame , taking me to the <T_4> york natural history <T_8> , buying me books on snakes , and <T_3> starting <T_7> infamous career of mine , which has culminated in of course , arriving in india 60 <T_2> ago , brought by <T_0> mother , doris <T_5> , and my stepfather , <T_9> chattopadhyaya .
the <T_1> thing which was so challenging about <T_0> swim <T_3> not just <T_2> altitude .
in <T_6> , <T_7> i saw &quot; <T_4> me , &quot; i <T_0> thinking of saying , <T_2> would <T_3> if an <T_5> had 31 days <T_1> fox <T_8> ?
i <T_0> faces .
<T_0> hours per person are shrinking , first <T_2> of the retirement of the <T_1> boomers , and <T_8> because there &apos;s been a very significant dropping out of the <T_3> force of <T_4> age adult males who <T_5> in the <T_7> half of <T_9> educational <T_6> .
<T_0> world was seen <T_1> less .
the <T_1> tiles fall <T_0> .
<T_2> , <T_1> had abed , would <T_0> the date .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_3> nature of <T_2> . we <T_0> tired .
so <T_1> see <T_3> clear need of active health <T_2> , <T_5> in the <T_0> of the <T_4> people .
and <T_2> &apos;re <T_3> like the <T_0> seals that you have <T_1> .
the <T_0> lama <T_3> once <T_5> portugal , and <T_2> was a lot <T_1> construction going on <T_4> .
and <T_3> my own <T_0> , from <T_8> to <T_4> , it &apos;s really <T_7> that we &apos;re taking a more human-centered approach to design , <T_6> we &apos;re including behaviors and <T_1> in the things we <T_2> , and i <T_9> this <T_5> great .
limburg , <T_1> proud <T_5> your <T_2> , <T_0> it is <T_4> used in the fight against <T_3> .
and <T_0> need that relationship to <T_2> , <T_1> reclaim <T_3> .
up until <T_1> , our communication with machines has <T_2> been limited <T_4> conscious <T_0> direct <T_3> .
and <T_0> was <T_3> a <T_1> percentage of <T_2> dead .
he doesn &apos;t <T_9> know what to <T_3> , <T_0> he starts going around the <T_1> and starts talking <T_5> people in the crowd and he <T_4> to people in this rather <T_7> way , &quot; <T_6> does it <T_2> to be <T_8> ? &quot;
even <T_1> , <T_2> will be long <T_0> by then .
<T_1> let me <T_2> you <T_0> we &apos;re doing .
the child <T_1> a role model for both <T_0> parents , <T_4> this is very <T_2> for <T_5> poor <T_3> .
and <T_2> there &apos;s a <T_0> mind , they <T_4> every <T_1> about <T_3> .
i <T_2> &apos;t answer <T_1> i &apos;m <T_3> doing things still , <T_4> &apos;m doing <T_5> like <T_6> always <T_0> .
i got up at <T_5> american association <T_2> cancer research , one of <T_0> big cancer research <T_7> , <T_3> 20,000 <T_6> there , <T_4> i <T_8> , &quot; <T_9> &apos;ve made <T_1> mistake .
<T_1> look at this animal <T_0> it !
but <T_4> we disbursed <T_6> loans , i <T_5> a <T_7> in uganda where i <T_8> newly <T_2> schools without textbooks or <T_1> , new health clinics without drugs , <T_3> the <T_0> once again <T_9> any voice or recourse .
<T_1> &apos;s when we <T_0> from the <T_4> shell , <T_2> we &apos;re <T_3> in free-fall .
<T_1> ideal <T_0> , <T_2> said monetization and fluency in <T_3> .
<T_7> went <T_2> miles went down , and <T_4> went <T_6> three miles away <T_1> the studio and <T_3> this <T_5> a <T_0> .
<T_0> don &apos;t want to <T_1> and lose that <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;ll have <T_0> computing .
so <T_1> happens <T_0> that burn gets going <T_2>
<T_1> let &apos;s take a look at <T_0> miraculous <T_2> up close .
one <T_1> the things <T_6> &apos;m most <T_9> about is <T_4> the spaceshipone is going to hang <T_5> air and space <T_8> , <T_3> to the <T_2> of st. <T_0> and the <T_7> flyer .
<T_7> i assigned her <T_4> after <T_6> , and one <T_5> i <T_2> the <T_8> &quot; <T_0> things i should <T_1> learned by <T_3> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> years ago .
and <T_2> inadequacy <T_5> cancer medicine <T_0> hit home <T_4> my <T_3> was <T_1> with pancreatic cancer .
this <T_5> an <T_2> which occurred <T_6> mount <T_3> ; it <T_0> the worst disaster in <T_4> history of <T_1> .
12th <T_4> i was to go <T_1> to <T_2> and speak <T_3> the <T_6> , i &apos;d have <T_5> bow down and <T_0> their feet .
<T_0> want <T_5> to snap <T_3> fingers exactly 50 times , <T_2> count backwards <T_1> 100 by seven , <T_6> this : <T_7> , <T_4> ...
who <T_2> ? <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> a big <T_3> .
now <T_0> you look at <T_4> five ways of being , these are the <T_1> same ways of being <T_3> need in <T_2> to <T_6> a good <T_5> .
we got <T_0> text from <T_2> saying <T_3> , now , <T_4> first <T_1> colonies <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;s the one <T_0> &apos;s looking at , <T_5> &#91; <T_1> &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s <T_4> for . can <T_3> see that ?
so , i think decoding this can <T_7> bring <T_1> to <T_0> developed <T_6> including <T_5> u.s. , <T_2> maybe <T_4> &apos;s ratings <T_8> go up <T_3> .
<T_1> organize their <T_2> life <T_0> this .
<T_0> of <T_1> are doing it .
we <T_1> &apos;t see into <T_2> engine <T_0> .
it &apos;s too <T_4> to get <T_1> picture of <T_6> on the ground before they <T_5> , too <T_0> to implement in <T_3> the <T_7> that <T_2> testing .
and <T_7> people talk about life <T_3> fossil fuels and climate change action , i think <T_4> &apos;s a lot of fluff , a <T_5> of greenwash , a <T_1> of misleading advertising , and i <T_8> a duty as a physicist to try to guide <T_6> around the <T_0> and help people understand the actions <T_2> really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do <T_9> up .
&quot; <T_1> girl , someday <T_2> world will be <T_0> trouble .
so when <T_6> put another <T_0> in every <T_2> , you put <T_7> robot <T_3> every <T_5> saying that <T_4> has to have robotic <T_1> .
and <T_0> knows <T_3> hard that <T_2> , but <T_4> &apos;ll probably find out <T_1> a few <T_5> .
this <T_0> the wordscape <T_2> the word <T_4> , <T_3> you can <T_5> most of the <T_6> is in <T_1> kitchen .
for some of <T_4> kind <T_2> technology , ground center is <T_1> combination <T_3> design , <T_0> is crucially <T_5> .
this is <T_0> system as it <T_1> today , by the way .
<T_1> : <T_2> you &apos;re going to have to use <T_0> .
<T_2> were <T_1> other <T_0> to do .
<T_0> within a <T_2> months <T_3> that sea urchin dying , <T_4> seaweed started <T_1> grow .
it was <T_0> persons saying , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s do <T_2> , &quot; and <T_1> company <T_5> , &quot; <T_3> . &quot;
<T_0> those <T_2> , <T_1> people are cared for .
you <T_4> consider this state boundaries , <T_1> you <T_3> , <T_0> pretty broad <T_2> .
it <T_1> part of the <T_0> .
and <T_1> think we <T_3> do that <T_2> public life more <T_0> .
it <T_1> &apos;t make any <T_0> .
<T_1> even <T_2> , it <T_3> foreshortens <T_0> life .
but <T_2> want to talk about <T_4> larger <T_1> , <T_3> world <T_0> the micro world .
you know , in <T_7> , there is <T_0> phenomenon called <T_5> , which <T_8> means <T_6> are larger <T_2> females <T_3> males have larger teeth <T_4> the <T_1> .
and <T_2> thing is , is <T_3> this <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> .
and this temporal <T_5> was something that energizes <T_3> comics , <T_8> i was <T_1> if <T_6> it also <T_2> other sorts of <T_7> , and <T_4> found <T_0> in <T_9> .
so it &apos;s really <T_0> as to <T_2> we need <T_1> put it in .
and <T_1> &apos;s free out <T_0> that <T_2> .
<T_3> picks <T_2> the <T_5> , <T_4> she does <T_0> needlepoint , and leaves little <T_1> .
<T_5> is <T_2> green <T_7> now , that are <T_0> source of the <T_1> content , which <T_6> me <T_3> my <T_4> story .
monterey <T_2> one of <T_4> few places in the <T_3> where <T_1> come <T_0> large numbers .
i <T_3> when <T_1> walked . <T_2> was bowed <T_0> .
<T_2> is supposed to be considered a <T_3> educational technology , but <T_1> was not <T_4> for education , it was meant for <T_0> boardroom <T_5> .
<T_0> is the great <T_1> .
<T_3> one part <T_0> that benefit is <T_4> much longer you think <T_1> program is going <T_5> be <T_2> .
i <T_3> you will <T_2> me in <T_1> magic carpet ride , and <T_5> children <T_0> be <T_4> .
i <T_5> that <T_0> a scientist , i have <T_2> and <T_7> a human being , i <T_4> communicate <T_3> anybody , <T_6> or outside <T_1> academia .
well , in <T_8> , when pete best was interviewed -- yes , <T_5> &apos;s <T_9> a drummer ; <T_6> , he &apos;s a <T_0> -- he <T_7> this to <T_4> : &quot; i <T_2> happier than i would have been with <T_1> beatles <T_3> &quot;
we <T_1> money in <T_2> , in <T_0> , a lot <T_3> brazil .
we <T_0> that <T_2> and some other <T_3> can <T_1> themselves <T_5> mirrors -- &quot; <T_6> &quot; as <T_7> to &quot; <T_4> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> of chaotic <T_0> i &apos;m bullying my <T_3> .
dr. phyllis <T_3> gave <T_4> my <T_0> , and she <T_2> me , &quot; how <T_5> you define <T_1> ? &quot;
<T_9> lavelle <T_0> the cello <T_1> a sorceress casting a spell , occasionally hiding behind her wild mane of <T_7> hair as <T_3> sings of pastoral <T_2> . she <T_8> &quot; <T_4> than the sun , &quot; backed <T_5> thomas dolby on <T_6> .
i <T_5> say to <T_0> partner , marisa <T_6> , <T_1> books everything -- <T_4> books <T_3> and she makes <T_2> happen .
<T_4> then , <T_3> by one , <T_6> reverse <T_7> order , they excuse <T_1> , entering <T_5> scrolling <T_2> of <T_0> .
two <T_2> of the <T_5> of europe -- <T_6> &apos;s <T_1> million <T_0> -- are having their sleep <T_4> by noise <T_3> that .
in 1990 , <T_2> from china to <T_1> united <T_4> : <T_0> billion <T_3> .
so the <T_0> day , <T_1> is the <T_2> one .
<T_1> just after that <T_5> woman brought me <T_3> little <T_4> , <T_2> i want to end on this <T_0> .
<T_2> explains most <T_1> political <T_0> .
suddenly , <T_2> became <T_0> orphan and <T_1> .
biologist <T_5> hijri brings to light <T_4> farming crisis no one is talking about : we are running out of phosphorus , <T_0> essential element that &apos;s a key component of dna and <T_7> basis of cellular communication . all <T_2> of this crisis <T_3> back to how <T_1> farm -- <T_9> chemical fertilizers chock-full of the element , which plants are not efficient at absorbing . <T_8> solution ? <T_6> … a microscopic mushroom .
and here <T_3> relates , in the documentary <T_0> &quot; <T_5> star , &quot; <T_8> her <T_2> urged her <T_6> to do this <T_4> told her <T_7> she <T_9> leaving them <T_1> democracy .
so <T_1> pulled out my <T_2> pda , and i said , &quot; <T_3> , let &apos;s <T_4> up my <T_5> for <T_0> 12th . &quot;
unfortunately , <T_6> science is <T_7> closer <T_2> being climatology in <T_1> in <T_8> cases , <T_9> , very <T_4> changes can have disproportionately huge effects , <T_3> equally , <T_5> areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually <T_0> absolutely bugger-all .
<T_3> stay . <T_0> i <T_2> , <T_1> will be killed .
and let &apos;s explore <T_0> notion of <T_1> .
<T_4> do that for all the <T_9> and phrases that <T_0> in those <T_2> , and that <T_7> us <T_5> big <T_1> of two billion lines that tell <T_6> about <T_3> way culture <T_8> been changing .
that &apos;s <T_4> i &apos;m talking to you <T_5> about the age of design , and the age of design <T_1> the age <T_6> which <T_7> is still <T_9> furniture , is still posters , <T_3> still fast <T_8> , <T_2> you see at <T_0> today .
so , now you &apos;re not alternately <T_0> and <T_2> the <T_1> , you &apos;re just alternately <T_5> and <T_3> the <T_4> .
<T_6> . <T_3> up : <T_5> in the <T_2> who &apos;s not <T_1> whether <T_0> is a <T_4> thing or a bad thing ?
<T_6> slowed down . and <T_1> went through <T_9> of <T_4> because we <T_0> no idea <T_3> the little amount of gas we had in the <T_5> could <T_8> us to <T_2> 45,000 <T_7> .
<T_0> become a <T_1> , <T_2> , jew .
<T_0> said , &quot; <T_1> &apos;ve <T_3> up <T_2> and <T_4> in cars . &quot;
<T_0> you <T_4> &apos;t have to <T_3> when <T_2> sit down with <T_1> other side .
so , we <T_0> to take <T_6> -- what <T_4> perceived as a <T_7> : <T_8> over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working <T_2> -- and turn it <T_5> a <T_3> and <T_1> run from it .
<T_0> , i &apos;m by no <T_1> the first <T_2> to <T_5> how <T_3> a tool <T_4> is .
i tend to <T_3> those <T_2> , <T_1> i <T_0> the tricks .
<T_0> &apos;m <T_1> happy to be <T_2> in india .
<T_2> -- which <T_0> did , which <T_1> did .
it &apos;s starts really , <T_0> early .
<T_0> &apos;s going on <T_1> your <T_2> ? &quot;
in <T_0> it is <T_1> .
<T_8> we &apos;re taking this data in 3d form , <T_7> it up <T_0> it gets past the <T_1> , we can actually create <T_4> that <T_3> more intricate <T_5> any <T_6> manufacturing technology -- or , in fact , are impossible <T_9> build in any <T_2> way .
but <T_3> you can <T_2> , all of that rain , almost <T_0> all it , has evaporated <T_1> the <T_4> .
that <T_8> , they require interest <T_0> in the <T_4> or <T_6> of percents in order <T_2> delay gratification <T_7> wait until <T_3> month <T_5> the extra <T_1> dollars .
<T_0> enough .
<T_7> &apos;re <T_6> , in fact , <T_1> those of <T_0> who live <T_4> the developed <T_2> need to be really <T_5> towards eliminating <T_3> emissions .
this <T_2> a low-altitude photograph that i <T_4> showing <T_5> dive boat <T_0> about <T_8> dozen of <T_3> big <T_1> tiger <T_7> sort of just swimming <T_6> behind .
now let &apos;s look at <T_1> part of the <T_2> , <T_0> former <T_3> republics of central <T_4> , the &apos; stans .
<T_1> has taken thousands of <T_4> with <T_0> group of photographers <T_2> covered the entire <T_3> .
fission .
<T_1> the <T_3> sport right around <T_5> vegas and <T_2> valley and that area <T_4> very , <T_0> good .
on <T_4> 42,000 mile <T_0> range . <T_3> job security , <T_1> not <T_5> way <T_2> go .
<T_0> had <T_1> god complex in spades .
but <T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> which <T_2> harder to <T_3> .
<T_1> percent of the cocoa <T_2> from <T_4> d &apos;ivoire <T_3> ghana <T_5> it &apos;s harvested <T_0> children .
but <T_0> want to give you three <T_5> to try <T_4> say that <T_7> trend line is in fact <T_1> the other <T_2> , and <T_3> &apos;s <T_6> internet helping it along .
<T_2> had met a <T_3> of children in the <T_4> island of saint <T_5> , and <T_6> did work <T_1> play <T_0> them .
<T_3> &apos;re <T_2> soap bubbles that <T_0> when <T_1> touch them .
<T_3> you <T_0> , <T_1> kind of admire people who do <T_2> at ideo <T_4> .
in our applications , we generally put <T_3> inside <T_1> diluent <T_2> supply , because it &apos;s <T_0> very cheap <T_5> easy <T_4> .
so <T_7> in the adults , as i told you , <T_9> brain region is <T_4> completely specialized -- it does almost <T_6> else except for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts -- <T_0> children it &apos;s much less <T_3> , when <T_2> are age five <T_5> eight , <T_8> age range of <T_1> children i just showed you .
<T_1> doubt , <T_4> that <T_5> 50 <T_3> ago , they even <T_0> of <T_6> salman khan <T_2> accomplished .
<T_0> looked <T_1> .
<T_1> expect a lot from <T_0> .
<T_7> bush <T_3> he was going <T_8> invade <T_0> , find <T_6> bunch of weapons of mass <T_4> , liberate <T_5> people <T_1> bring democracy to <T_2> middle east .
so <T_4> &apos;s the <T_3> question <T_1> &apos;d like to <T_6> you with : what <T_0> of the good <T_5> do <T_2> designs convey ?
it &apos;s exactly the <T_3> logical error as the logical error of thinking <T_0> after <T_6> disease test , <T_4> is <T_5> percent <T_8> , the <T_7> of having the <T_2> is 99 <T_1> .
it &apos;s interesting , because it was <T_9> years <T_0> when i was <T_3> with my <T_8> child <T_5> i <T_1> that <T_7> most commonly <T_2> preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen <T_6> it gets into the human <T_4> .
and in <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;s upon <T_0> .
<T_9> : <T_3> actually are <T_2> more charging stations <T_4> people realize , and <T_0> tesla we <T_8> something called a supercharging technology , <T_7> we &apos;re offering that <T_5> you buy <T_6> model s <T_1> free , forever .
sugata <T_1> : <T_2> can <T_0> themselves
and <T_0> is just <T_2> of <T_1> many mind-blowing <T_5> that <T_4> mathematicians have to deal with <T_3> day .
<T_0> , <T_1> !
and basically what they <T_0> is anyone out there to develop their own peer <T_6> process , so <T_3> they <T_2> focus on the <T_9> in the <T_4> that <T_5> think is <T_8> important and <T_7> can think of ted as a <T_1> lens .
i started to have <T_0> everywhere .
<T_1> block : tagging <T_0> in the <T_2> ocean
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> out .
<T_8> , when we hear <T_9> threats of <T_2> and the <T_4> rhetoric , we &apos;re <T_5> led to believe that this is yet another <T_3> of those unsolvable <T_0> eastern conflicts with <T_6> as <T_7> as the <T_1> itself .
<T_5> it <T_1> brought home to me the <T_2> which <T_6> had <T_0> to <T_4> in all of us about the importance <T_3> finding balance in <T_7> .
<T_1> has <T_3> inconsistencies , unless <T_2> allow for <T_5> wholly <T_4> -- extra <T_0> of space .
so <T_0> the deep sea squid hunt , i <T_3> using an <T_5> lure attached to <T_7> camera platform with no thrusters , no motors , just <T_6> battery-powered camera , and the <T_1> illumination coming <T_8> red <T_2> that &apos;s invisible <T_9> most deep-sea animals that are adapted to <T_4> primarily blue .
<T_0> , <T_1> .
it &apos;s great <T_4> we have <T_8> to <T_5> , let &apos;s go create the <T_3> and <T_2> people <T_9> the <T_7> , <T_0> that &apos;s <T_6> great force <T_1> peace .
<T_0> can change the fabric of <T_2> entire <T_1> .
<T_3> , <T_0> that &apos;s what we <T_2> , <T_1> how are <T_5> going to <T_4> that ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s <T_8> amazing <T_2> , <T_3> i &apos;ll <T_9> you , if <T_5> come home , and <T_0> spouse , or <T_4> it is , says , &quot; <T_7> &apos;s talk &quot; -- that , like , chills <T_1> to the very <T_6> .
he likes <T_0> , <T_1> likes <T_2> .
well , so did i .
<T_6> the <T_5> is <T_2> the end of the <T_3> , <T_0> you still have to transmit that <T_4> to <T_1> people .
<T_6> , now , cross your <T_3> over , <T_2> your right hand <T_9> over , <T_7> your fingers <T_8> this , then make <T_5> your right thumb is outside your <T_4> thumb -- <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> important .
i &apos;m going to do &quot; lush <T_1> . &quot; it &apos;s one of <T_2> favorite <T_0> to <T_3> .
<T_7> only have to go to <T_3> black <T_8> and <T_0> few <T_1> places -- some <T_4> -- and get down , and <T_6> &apos;ll find that the <T_2> itself turns <T_5> .
of <T_5> , a <T_6> of people <T_2> they <T_1> know the proper answer <T_0> the <T_3> , &quot; what is <T_4> ? &quot;
like <T_1> you &apos;re looking for <T_2> in students &apos; <T_4> , <T_0> &apos;ll point right to <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> 17-year-old .
<T_3> we <T_4> to do <T_1> inter-agency operations , <T_0> frankly <T_2> rice was in charge of .
my <T_2> for <T_0> goes beyond reasonable <T_1> .
the design process was <T_6> tough , almost like a struggle for survival , but <T_7> an idea <T_0> : <T_8> sort of idea <T_2> a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city , sort of expanding <T_9> public space onto <T_1> we refer to as a scandinavian version of the <T_5> steps in <T_4> , but sort of public on <T_3> outside , as well as on the inside , with the library .
so , it <T_1> an <T_0> discovery .
and so <T_5> year , <T_9> share my <T_0> with my <T_2> , because <T_1> need to know that <T_4> has a <T_8> , <T_3> has a struggle , <T_7> everyone <T_6> help along the way .
<T_1> when i asked <T_0> pediatrician <T_5> had been going <T_7> , <T_8> said <T_2> thought in the morning <T_6> had <T_3> had a <T_4> .
<T_2> of course <T_3> &quot; criticism , <T_1> , assholes <T_0> pressure . &quot;
i &apos;m going to argue tonight <T_2> compassion <T_0> the <T_1> rule are , in a <T_3> sense , built into human <T_4> .
so , <T_3> would suggest that <T_0> don &apos;t think <T_2> , we <T_1> replicators .
you know , that <T_2> &apos;s <T_5> despotic <T_4> ; <T_1> wants us <T_3> feel like <T_0> .
if <T_5> seems like some <T_3> , abstruse <T_1> , <T_6> the u.k. , the <T_0> office had a 98 <T_2> success rate at <T_8> first-class mail <T_7> next <T_4> .
and <T_2> had a <T_6> to do that , when <T_4> geographic asked <T_0> if <T_3> wanted to <T_1> anything <T_5> china .
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 <T_0> working 24 <T_1> , seven <T_2> .
<T_2> the <T_1> can hold their <T_0> up high .
now , <T_0> the satellites things .
<T_0> may <T_1> ?
<T_2> &apos;s one <T_0> you <T_3> take for <T_1> , you know ?
<T_7> he had the <T_9> to say , he said , &quot; you know , if you were paying me <T_2> dollars <T_3> hour , i <T_5> see <T_1> you might <T_6> that , but right now , i &apos;m saving <T_0> five <T_8> a <T_4> .
and <T_5> we do a <T_0> bunch of stuff to them , and <T_4> those therapies , <T_3> get <T_1> to live , on average , <T_6> their fifth <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_3> worst <T_2> you &apos;ve ever heard <T_1> africa ?
<T_7> the <T_6> is that this kind of <T_1> happens all the <T_9> , <T_0> it <T_5> not just the stories you read <T_3> the news but <T_4> the <T_8> you see on <T_2> shelves .
<T_4> if <T_1> were to go to the <T_0> of michigan <T_5> , and <T_8> to adopt <T_6> young person who is <T_2> an <T_3> , i would be disqualified <T_7> only <T_9> reason : because i &apos;m gay .
but <T_1> can <T_2> reveal themselves <T_4> , <T_3> the form of <T_0> .
maybe they &apos;re going to <T_1> at the u.n. headquarters down the road <T_4> , <T_2> maybe they &apos;ll pick <T_3> smarter <T_8> -- but <T_0> they <T_6> and they give <T_5> a <T_7> .
that &apos;s why <T_1> grow homes . thanks <T_0> much .
<T_3> &apos;s problems <T_1> &apos;t be solved <T_0> they &apos;re <T_2> .
they <T_0> up some of <T_1> tools that <T_2> &apos;ve developed .
<T_2> you <T_1> stay down he <T_3> it <T_0> .
<T_3> leads me to think <T_1> neither <T_2> nor <T_6> character , <T_0> explanations for <T_7> kind of <T_5> , are really <T_4> .
and <T_3> to <T_7> little <T_0> that it &apos;s going to cause -- <T_6> it &apos;s going to be embarrassing when <T_8> &apos;m looking on his <T_9> and <T_5> that <T_1> has a farmville problem and that whole bit -- that &apos;s overwhelmed by the <T_2> of looking <T_4> the phone .
<T_3> &apos;s the russians planting <T_2> flag <T_1> the ocean <T_4> to <T_6> a claim <T_0> minerals <T_7> the receding arctic <T_5> ice .
<T_2> mechanical <T_3> will not get their <T_0> from <T_4> , but <T_1> the wind .
and as <T_4> as i put those <T_3> youtube <T_5> up , something <T_0> happened -- <T_2> a bunch <T_1> interesting <T_6> happened .
i &apos;m delivering ; they &apos;re <T_3> taking . i &apos;ve <T_1> this <T_0> 20 <T_2> .
so , <T_2> sponsor <T_0> terrorism , <T_1> of the cold <T_3> .
<T_2> used <T_0> software <T_1> told me to <T_3> .
all <T_3> of them turned <T_4> started <T_2> back to the coast and <T_1> five died <T_5> that return <T_0> .
<T_9> so six-year-old <T_5> there <T_1> that <T_7> first one took one , <T_6> the second one took <T_0> more and the total <T_8> four on that one , the third one <T_2> five more and the total <T_4> nine on that one , <T_3> then the next one .
<T_1> when you <T_0> that over <T_2> the kind of ubiquitous <T_7> that we &apos;re starting to see , what <T_3> find is , in <T_4> , even <T_5> access <T_6> into spaces .
<T_1> : <T_2> ! &#91; splat &#93; <T_3> : <T_0> .
of <T_2> , these <T_6> imply <T_8> shifting <T_4> cost <T_3> revenues <T_5> data holders and <T_0> subjects , <T_7> is why , perhaps , <T_9> don &apos;t hear more about <T_1> .
the <T_1> poster boy for this <T_0> is david <T_2> .
<T_0> how ?
<T_2> and <T_1> are geniuses <T_3> they turn <T_4> , and then there &apos;s a <T_0> decline .
<T_2> has <T_0> been seen <T_1> .
and again , when you can take <T_3> from <T_1> as diverse as this to do something as <T_2> as this , we &apos;re really creating <T_0> moment .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_7> joint of tubes . you <T_4> by teaching angles -- an <T_5> angle , <T_6> right <T_3> , <T_8> obtuse <T_1> , a <T_0> angle .
<T_8> turns out that lady gaga <T_5> released <T_3> new single -- <T_4> five <T_6> six new singles , as near as i can <T_1> -- <T_7> &quot; <T_9> a <T_0> , <T_2> . &quot;
<T_8> is <T_2> graph from <T_0> paper by <T_1> gneezy <T_6> aldo <T_3> , who set out to test , at the beginning of <T_4> decade , what <T_7> called &quot; deterrence <T_5> . &quot;
maybe a <T_3> thought <T_0> something <T_1> all <T_2> about .
and <T_3> after that , <T_6> are all <T_7> of compounds <T_5> elements <T_8> we <T_1> extract , like phosphates , <T_0> we need to get <T_4> into the <T_2> soils <T_9> fertilize them .
<T_0> really is a little bit out <T_1> place <T_2> .
and 250 <T_0> all <T_1> .
<T_2> i was <T_0> to <T_1> that he <T_3> wrote <T_4> book <T_5> he was on sabbatical .
<T_0> really <T_1> to have sex .
and also <T_4> found out <T_1> &apos;s many vietnamese <T_5> suffering and <T_0> at <T_6> catholic <T_2> -- all <T_7> building <T_3> totally destroyed .
<T_0> you <T_1> that reaction .
so a <T_0> of light could go <T_2> , be <T_3> up into <T_4> observer &apos;s eye , <T_6> the <T_5> sees a <T_1> of light here .
so these <T_0> examples <T_2> this idea of open-source <T_1> .
where <T_0> we take <T_1> ?
<T_2> is <T_3> we have to move <T_5> bits <T_0> to actually get the people <T_1> answers <T_6> their <T_4> .
<T_2> that , i <T_0> adapt to something <T_1> .
above , it &apos;s <T_2> kind of , i bought a <T_0> for <T_1> mother .
<T_1> those <T_3> , or <T_4> on <T_0> you are , <T_2> may not be <T_5> available .
i just <T_0> a seven-country solo <T_1> .
that &apos;s why <T_2> sex <T_1> &apos;t so <T_0> .
<T_6> spend a lot of time <T_5> about <T_7> the <T_0> landscape is <T_1> , <T_3> new technologies <T_2> new constraints and new <T_4> for people .
so <T_8> know that our beliefs and expectations can be <T_5> , which is <T_1> we do trials <T_0> we <T_4> against a <T_3> -- <T_9> one <T_6> of the people get the <T_7> treatment and the <T_2> half get placebo .
<T_1> it &apos;s then being <T_0> open .
<T_0> is <T_2> really <T_6> the medical doctors are using <T_3> now , but <T_4> hope <T_5> will in the <T_1> .
but i have to <T_1> you <T_2> funny <T_0> .
<T_2> , i <T_1> an x-ray , and <T_4> next <T_5> -- you may have noticed , those of <T_6> who have been <T_0> a medical <T_3> will <T_7> this .
well , it &apos;s <T_0> the war <T_1> terror .
google <T_4> is <T_1> we <T_8> , which is really cool , which <T_7> you -- for <T_3> to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there &apos;s a pool of researchers that <T_5> out and research it for you , and <T_9> &apos;s guaranteed <T_6> all that , and you <T_0> get actually very good answers to things without spending all that <T_2> yourself .
<T_3> went to <T_1> school <T_0> design <T_2> then i began my career as a <T_4> .
but <T_4> need to support these &#91; unclear &#93; , critical <T_3> responsible <T_0> in <T_6> , <T_1> lebanon , <T_2> your local <T_5> , in the apple store .
i <T_0> , &quot; keep <T_1> alive <T_3> you <T_2> . &quot;
we <T_5> buses at the <T_0> pond . we <T_9> got <T_1> two more buses and we drove through <T_4> and iran , afghanistan , <T_6> the khyber <T_8> , into <T_3> , like every <T_7> young <T_2> .
then <T_4> day <T_0> told him , &quot; <T_5> e. , <T_1> is subordination for verbal <T_3> to tonal <T_2> ? &quot;
we &apos;ve already <T_0> examples of this working well .
and <T_2> , <T_1> they &apos;re <T_6> , they may raise <T_3> to help <T_4> in <T_5> parts of the <T_0> .
you know , getting <T_4> used to different realities , i <T_6> , <T_1> so important . <T_7> dan dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to <T_3> a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in <T_0> belief systems -- <T_2> think <T_8> is so necessary <T_9> our world <T_5> as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
and this <T_1> very <T_0> stuff .
<T_2> think we <T_1> it <T_3> . <T_0> , good , <T_4> .
we hit <T_8> last <T_1> maximum <T_6> 16,000 years ago , <T_2> basically , from 70,000 years on , things were getting really <T_5> , <T_7> very <T_4> . <T_9> northern <T_0> had massive growing ice <T_3> .
<T_2> , <T_1> pore can open <T_0> close .
it also <T_1> a whole lot of things <T_6> what <T_0> thought <T_5> was , <T_9> they <T_3> it could and couldn &apos;t do , what <T_4> thought it <T_8> and <T_7> &apos;t <T_2> .
and <T_4> &apos;ve fallen <T_1> love with him , as <T_3> have <T_2> herbie <T_0> with his <T_5> .
their <T_2> are chopped up with <T_4> and are <T_0> to be used for some <T_6> or some <T_3> for people <T_7> get money -- or <T_8> many , many <T_5> people would <T_1> about it .
i <T_3> it <T_2> i think <T_7> it is critical <T_1> understanding <T_4> in <T_0> ocean where <T_5> bioluminescence <T_6> .
families <T_0> the help .
<T_4> actually take <T_2> very small <T_1> of the bladder from <T_0> patient -- less <T_3> half the size of a postage stamp .
i <T_0> &apos;t have my <T_1> hip <T_3> this <T_2> .
<T_0> won &apos;t go into <T_1> .
<T_0> some of <T_2> grandchildren <T_1> will .
so , at 2.3 billion <T_1> before <T_0> first ball was <T_2> .
<T_0> flips its <T_3> 180 <T_2> and it <T_6> its leg <T_1> the two <T_4> and catches the <T_5> .
and just <T_3> february , the <T_1> time we did these trials , i <T_0> a miracle <T_2> to happen .
<T_2> for that , we owe <T_0> a great <T_1> of thanks .
<T_3> that is <T_1> what the <T_0> paradigm <T_2> .
<T_0> had written , &quot; <T_3> , <T_4> exciting , &quot; <T_1> pencil , in <T_2> corner .
i <T_4> that in <T_7> last 16 <T_1> i &apos;ve <T_5> you something that <T_2> didn &apos;t know <T_3> aids , and <T_6> hope that <T_9> &apos;ve gotten <T_8> questioning a little bit some of the things <T_0> you did know .
<T_6> this <T_2> you , of <T_5> , how much <T_4> had in <T_0> sleep , in <T_1> sleep , and all <T_3> sort of thing .
now let &apos;s <T_0> the <T_1> first .
&quot; no , no . <T_1> share <T_0> because <T_4> don &apos;t <T_3> to go <T_2> jail . &quot;
<T_1> want to stop <T_0> tail from <T_2> .
<T_2> , what <T_6> &apos;ve <T_3> is <T_4> there &apos;s no such thing as a <T_0> user -- really is <T_1> we &apos;ve <T_5> .
<T_3> this <T_4> , we &apos;re spending 110 billion <T_1> a <T_0> on <T_2> food .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> a <T_0> park .
the <T_0> are absolutely <T_2> made for open <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;m sorry , but <T_0> is no <T_1> way to describe it .
<T_3> morning , again , after <T_2> out of that <T_0> your brain is <T_1> wiped out .
<T_4> would be <T_1> down the <T_2> as everything <T_5> would be , and all <T_3> would be left would be a <T_0> .
<T_2> there are <T_3> things that <T_0> really <T_1> about this .
the <T_1> was <T_2> build <T_0> clay vault .
<T_1> , moving <T_0> .
you <T_0> what today &apos;s <T_1> is doing ? concave <T_2> .
<T_6> of <T_9> and <T_3> that the <T_5> performing <T_2> -- which have set curtain times , set venues , <T_0> inconveniences of <T_1> , parking <T_7> the like -- <T_8> cannot <T_4> .
a <T_1> trains <T_3> body in <T_4> how to recognize and <T_2> a specific <T_0> .
<T_4> it <T_1> from such items as a complete de-mining equipment <T_5> these kind <T_0> water-sterilizing <T_3> , so it <T_2> really wide-ranging .
and <T_1> it &apos;s amazing , <T_5> i got phone <T_6> from <T_3> reporters <T_7> , &quot; have <T_2> actually seen the <T_4> going into <T_0> star ? &quot;
<T_4> dan dennett <T_1> a <T_7> argument that not only don &apos;t we understand <T_3> own <T_2> , but that half the time <T_5> brains are <T_0> fooling <T_6> .
<T_6> we <T_7> to <T_2> on reconstructing these <T_8> lines on <T_9> map , infrastructure , that cross <T_4> straight lines , the <T_3> , i <T_5> the middle east would be <T_1> far more <T_0> region .
<T_3> , <T_1> the <T_0> 12 years it &apos;s become much more <T_4> that <T_2> is .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_3> to darwin <T_1> mendel and <T_0> on .
because <T_1> to eisenhower , that is what <T_0> find in <T_2> developing world .
<T_0> was <T_2> hot <T_3> , and we <T_1> ourselves down by the <T_4> .
<T_3> last is that we &apos;re <T_4> connected <T_6> to more <T_5> on the planet than <T_0> before -- except for <T_1> you &apos;re sitting <T_2> to someone .
so <T_5> realized we <T_8> full diversity , even <T_4> it <T_9> be <T_0> to <T_1> what de <T_2> said when <T_3> what <T_7> was like to be president <T_6> france .
<T_0> we &apos;re at <T_1> 44,000 dollars of total output per member of the population .
i <T_6> the social <T_4> is <T_3> and meaningful and <T_2> , and i <T_5> the same thing <T_1> the medical <T_0> .
<T_1> : <T_2> was good skimming <T_0> .
airbag designers <T_1> have the <T_0> of getting flat sheets <T_2> a small <T_3> .
and <T_1> is actually particularly <T_0> linked to <T_2> .
so here , i &apos;m using a rendering algorithm to paint <T_6> frequencies of the song &quot; smells like teen <T_8> &quot; in a <T_0> that <T_5> eyes can take them in <T_3> a single visual <T_9> , and <T_7> technique will also show <T_1> strengths of the <T_4> cortex for <T_2> recognition .
<T_0> same for the <T_1> semi-conductor industry .
<T_0> need to work with <T_3> people in <T_4> communities , and give them <T_1> resources and the tools <T_7> they <T_9> to solve <T_6> own <T_8> . that &apos;s <T_5> best <T_2> to do it .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_3> about <T_1> ; you <T_0> that , <T_2> knows that .
<T_2> use <T_0> active <T_4> to make it move forward <T_3> backward . it <T_5> called <T_1> .
so here <T_2> am <T_1> on the airplane <T_3> up to <T_0> .
that <T_5> pose a potential <T_1> to <T_3> society , but <T_0> knows ; <T_9> &apos;re <T_6> a globalized <T_7> , <T_4> they can look <T_8> girlfriends from <T_2> countries .
<T_1> we have to make <T_0> day work .
and <T_0> is <T_1> interesting .
and <T_0> species really <T_1> the public <T_2> attention .
i mean <T_7> we have mathematically consistent theories that <T_0> actually <T_9> to explain a <T_3> different <T_5> , <T_6> , things that i haven &apos;t even talked <T_8> , that each <T_4> the existence of a very <T_1> interacting , <T_2> particle .
how ?
&quot; it will <T_0> you . &quot;
<T_2> let &apos;s turn <T_0> people moving <T_1> borders .
<T_2> big challenge <T_1> , <T_3> should the ipads be used , and <T_6> apps <T_5> we put <T_4> the <T_0> ?
how <T_1> we find <T_0> entire <T_2> ?
<T_5> the weird thing <T_0> , we have <T_3> absorbed <T_4> lesson 150 <T_1> later ; none of us really <T_2> this .
<T_8> , <T_6> &apos;s the medical <T_3> the <T_5> says , &quot; <T_0> , <T_2> told you , you <T_7> &apos;t going to be able to , you can &apos;t do this , <T_4> just know <T_1> . &quot;
<T_4> classic example <T_2> james <T_3> , a <T_5> climatologist pushing for 350 parts per million <T_0> in the atmosphere <T_1>
<T_1> must be <T_2> call <T_0> action .
now , you &apos;re <T_1> thinking , <T_3> , <T_0> about <T_2> brain tissue ?
<T_1> somebody <T_2> , nobody <T_0> . &quot;
but every <T_3> country i have been to -- <T_4> in the <T_7> six <T_9> i &apos;ve been to about <T_0> countries , <T_6> many <T_1> little <T_2> and cities <T_8> towns -- <T_5> have seen something what i &apos;ve come to call &quot; vagina warriors . &quot;
<T_4> the <T_0> years before <T_3> swim , <T_1> percent of <T_5> arctic sea ice cover just melted <T_2> .
just wanted <T_1> say , &quot; hey <T_0> .
<T_0> study <T_2> dinosaurs <T_6> to <T_1> realization <T_5> there &apos;s a problem <T_3> asteroid impact , <T_4> example .
so it <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> the <T_2> on .
<T_0> didn &apos;t have high <T_2> for that <T_1> .
<T_3> , last <T_1> i <T_2> that . <T_4> was <T_0> mistake .
<T_2> other <T_6> about <T_1> society and <T_3> it causes this <T_0> is that we have <T_4> at <T_5> center that is non-human .
<T_9> perform a <T_6> of <T_2> experiments on <T_8> -- <T_0> this case , trying <T_3> calibrate <T_7> mathematical <T_4> so that one can predict <T_5> what the internal <T_1> times are .
essentially , i &apos;m a mustache farmer .
but <T_0> is <T_2> a very serious <T_4> to <T_1> -- they <T_3> ideologically driven .
<T_0> me , &quot; <T_8> and <T_4> : svu , &quot; tine fey <T_6> &quot; <T_5> rock &quot; <T_7> &quot; <T_3> judy &quot; -- &quot; the people are <T_2> , the cases are <T_9> , the <T_1> are final . &quot;
now , each year <T_0> perform about 300,000 <T_1> .
so <T_2> was <T_1> bit of <T_0> conflict there .
this is <T_7> , a nine-year-old <T_3> girl , <T_6> back ruined <T_8> napalm , and she <T_2> the <T_9> of the nation of <T_1> to <T_0> to end <T_5> vietnam <T_4> .
<T_0> chose <T_1> gun .
<T_2> draw those <T_3> into <T_1> prearranged <T_4> that <T_0> explicit goals .
<T_2> , <T_1> comes to my office <T_0> day .
<T_3> then realized <T_7> if <T_4> could know something <T_6> you <T_1> use it <T_0> help you , there &apos;s an <T_2> more valuable <T_5> than that .
<T_4> the mining <T_2> the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a <T_0> that the planet <T_1> never seen <T_3> .
it <T_1> a bit of a <T_6> stopper , which was problematic <T_2> the <T_5> kept on trying to <T_0> away the <T_7> , but <T_9> fun -- it <T_3> great for me <T_4> do <T_8> performance .
<T_3> lives <T_5> this <T_2> -- no running water <T_4> no <T_1> other than -- no <T_0> and high-speed internet connection .
<T_0> universe was <T_3> 13.7 billion <T_6> ago , and then you created all the <T_1> , and <T_7> the planets , and <T_2> the galaxies , <T_5> all the <T_4> ways .
but when <T_9> comes increasingly to <T_4> access to the essentials <T_1> the good life -- decent <T_8> care , access to the <T_5> education , <T_7> voice and <T_0> in campaigns -- when <T_6> comes to govern all of those <T_3> , inequality <T_2> a great deal .
so it <T_3> be that <T_2> would just have to <T_1> tune it very <T_4> to get the <T_0> without getting any <T_5> .
hawken fulfilled <T_3> and industry , <T_4> humankind away <T_0> the abyss because , <T_6> continued <T_8> decline of <T_1> biosphere , <T_5> very <T_7> person is at <T_9> here -- frankly , an <T_2> risk .
so in the <T_4> that <T_1> ambition that had carried <T_0> through <T_3> bleak childhood <T_2> been realized .
i think <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> to <T_1> .
<T_0> , of course <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> the <T_3> thing about <T_2> that &apos;s <T_5> .
and <T_1> of the <T_6> things we can <T_2> we &apos;ve <T_3> a bit about here <T_5> is <T_4> the curve <T_0> the left .
so we &apos;ll <T_2> something <T_6> c3po to become a <T_0> between <T_3> and <T_1> of the other <T_4> we live <T_5> .
<T_0> &apos;s what <T_1> world bank <T_2> .
several <T_2> pass and it gets <T_1> , and even <T_0> man <T_4> &apos;t <T_3> it .
<T_5> it was <T_1> if through the <T_3> of my <T_4> life , i <T_2> &apos;t lived up to my <T_0> potential .
<T_1> i &apos;m slamming <T_3> together so <T_2> that <T_4> hydrogen fuses together , <T_8> in the process <T_7> has <T_6> byproducts , and <T_5> utilize <T_0> byproducts .
in the <T_2> world , if you take rats , <T_7> are hardwired to play <T_6> a certain <T_5> of their juvenile years and you <T_4> play -- <T_1> squeak , they <T_8> , they <T_3> each <T_9> , that &apos;s part of <T_0> play .
<T_0> relationship with <T_2> began on <T_1> rather curious <T_3> .
<T_1> and <T_2> , <T_0> didn &apos;t <T_4> about style for <T_3> &apos;s own sake .
<T_1> i &apos;m going to recenter the <T_0> on saturn , here .
don &apos;t be shy of it .
it <T_2> very late <T_6> night , and at age <T_7> , he <T_1> typing <T_4> 70-page <T_3> interest <T_8> against <T_5> in <T_0> road project .
one <T_5> of grasshoppers <T_3> the <T_2> amount of <T_0> as 10 hot dogs , <T_4> six <T_1> macs .
<T_9> that same <T_4> , i have <T_1> tell you <T_2> with the <T_0> of hollywood <T_6> that came out last <T_5> , we have never <T_3> monsters underground -- at least <T_8> kind that <T_7> you .
actually , you could <T_1> i grew <T_3> in the <T_7> of <T_4> republic , <T_6> known as <T_5> heights in <T_2> york <T_0> .
i guess <T_1> in <T_4> one campaign <T_5> love you <T_0> be contagious , <T_3> it , <T_6> it , <T_2> it on .
nicholas christakis : how <T_1> networks <T_0>
animals , just <T_0> humans , <T_1> get strange <T_2> .
<T_2> the baby &apos;s born , it recognizes <T_0> voice and it prefers <T_1> to her voice <T_3> anyone else &apos;s .
so <T_0> finished , and <T_1> was a <T_2> in a <T_3> .
i <T_3> preaching in <T_1> jose some time ago , and <T_4> friend <T_6> , <T_2> helped <T_5> me to this conference , brought several <T_9> and leaders of <T_0> of the companies here in the silicon valley to have <T_7> with me , or i with them <T_8>
somebody once <T_1> that nostalgia is <T_2> one utterly most <T_5> human <T_6> -- so <T_3> think <T_4> &apos;s <T_7> case <T_0> serious play .
and <T_1> you hear <T_2> white <T_4> , <T_0> brain is <T_3> focused on it .
sam , <T_4> is <T_0> conversation <T_1> would actually <T_3> to continue for <T_2> .
so <T_0> investigate <T_3> , let <T_2> bring you back now <T_1> 1980 .
two <T_1> later , and the <T_0> was dramatic .
and that <T_0> ?
<T_5> see <T_0> like dow <T_1> leading the <T_4> away <T_7> trans fat <T_3> saturated fat <T_6> innovative <T_2> products .
<T_3> &apos;m dr. <T_1> ; <T_4> &apos;m a u.n. ambassador <T_2> i &apos;m walking <T_5> the <T_0> . &quot;
<T_1> the <T_2> is <T_0> this audience .
they <T_2> water-loving tips , <T_0> waxy <T_1> .
<T_1> dikes have <T_4> . <T_2> wade <T_0> law <T_3> day long .
<T_0> it &apos;s very much <T_1> the beginning .
<T_0> what ? <T_1> stones , <T_2> earth .
are <T_1> with <T_0> ?
they <T_1> to give their children <T_2> best chance <T_0> life .
i <T_1> struck <T_0> .
and <T_1> day <T_0> couldn &apos;t <T_2> up a line of figures .
all you do is connect <T_9> the <T_5> , and <T_1> bristles <T_7> wet , <T_6> they conduct , and the <T_0> &apos;s body conducts , and <T_8> is great to <T_3> on , and then you <T_4> start hooking to <T_2> , even the kitchen sink .
and <T_4> are <T_3> toxic , <T_1> , poisonous <T_2> during <T_0> day at work .
so <T_2> price of oil , much like lots <T_5> other <T_0> that <T_3> &apos;ve seen , goes <T_4> a <T_1> curve .
now <T_0> the animal world , there is <T_2> one <T_1> to increase <T_4> , and <T_5> &apos;s <T_3> .
<T_5> , of course , affords <T_2> throughput , <T_3> accidents , and <T_1> interesting model <T_4> social <T_0> .
<T_2> we have <T_0> handshake with one of <T_6> large <T_3> grocers <T_5> our <T_4> in all <T_1> stores in six states .
<T_5> year , volkswagen <T_4> that by <T_3> year <T_0> &apos;ll be producing this <T_1> fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 <T_2> a gallon .
and we <T_3> to <T_5> this both <T_8> being able to go somewhere <T_7> in the <T_6> -- <T_2> we <T_1> going to go to mars , for instance , would <T_9> take a biosphere <T_0> us , <T_4> live in it ?
<T_1> , effectively , you get 3d data <T_2> real time <T_0> the subject .
<T_4> my <T_0> on the other side is <T_3> going to be , &quot; what do you <T_2> they <T_1> ? &quot;

<T_0> believe <T_1> 24 percent <T_3> american twitter users <T_2> african-american .
<T_1> here &apos;s <T_0> second <T_2> line .
<T_0> think <T_2> is <T_1> for hope .
<T_3> &apos;re going to use these big <T_0> and we &apos;re going to try to <T_2> on signals . everybody <T_1> understand that .
the <T_7> five <T_3> after <T_2> train crash , <T_6> were <T_8> million <T_0> of the posting <T_1> social <T_4> , <T_5> never happened in chinese history .
so <T_3> we all need to leave <T_0> children with a value <T_1> , and <T_2> a financial <T_4> .
<T_4> part <T_2> the issue <T_6> for <T_0> -- who &apos;s here , <T_7> years old -- and <T_1> have permission <T_5> relay <T_3> number .
<T_0> the <T_3> , the high <T_1> of climate change is <T_2> .
it &apos;s <T_1> that <T_3> don &apos;t <T_2> how <T_0> looks .
<T_1> can &apos;t be that <T_0> . &quot;
<T_2> there &apos;s <T_7> who wants their <T_6> to <T_1> like this , <T_4> would be <T_3> , <T_0> it <T_5> &apos;t work .
and <T_1> used it to design <T_0> solar <T_2> .
but <T_0> it <T_4> , <T_8> can &apos;t help but thinking <T_2> woke up one <T_3> like , &quot; <T_9> my <T_6> , <T_1> wasn &apos;t there <T_5> night . <T_7> !
but <T_3> goes <T_1> step <T_0> , and it <T_4> to have actual <T_2> .
<T_1> is turbo <T_0> penguin .
it &apos;s <T_1> a carbon-oxygen <T_0> .
<T_1> , <T_2> shalt not <T_0> the irrational .
and <T_1> see <T_0> mechanics .
my <T_3> was born in <T_4> , <T_1> he <T_0> mildly <T_2> biased .
<T_2> ! <T_1> wants to see the <T_5> : page not found . but as renny gleeson <T_7> us , <T_6> he runs through a <T_0> of <T_9> and funny 404 pages , every <T_3> is really a <T_4> to build a better <T_8> .
<T_0> , <T_1> ready ? <T_3> . off you <T_2> .
because eight-year-olds don &apos;t get to <T_2> -- and <T_1> they do , you <T_3> be in <T_0> .
and <T_0> the <T_2> -- <T_7> most powerful <T_5> in <T_6> history <T_8> mankind was able to muster for <T_4> rescue , believe it or not , was literally <T_9> heroic two <T_1> soldiers went <T_3> the shaft . building was shaking .
we have <T_5> and <T_3> that tell us <T_1> the <T_0> should be so <T_4> lux and of <T_2> uniformity .
the <T_5> is , <T_7> , <T_4> even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a <T_2> social <T_6> . we &apos;re <T_8> a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . in fact , our minds <T_0> on <T_3> people . they depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of <T_1> you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are <T_9> to you .
and <T_0> a <T_5> , <T_4> have 1,000 <T_6> that <T_3> parked across <T_7> and 6,000 <T_2> who are <T_8> and <T_1> to drive them .
now <T_0> you want dinosaur dna , i say go <T_1> the <T_2> .
<T_0> these <T_6> units , i designed specifically so <T_8> they would <T_1> parts of letterforms within their <T_5> so that i <T_2> then join <T_3> pieces together to create <T_7> and then <T_9> within the abstract <T_4> .
<T_2> must be <T_6> to <T_4> what <T_1> or she <T_7> experienced <T_8> true , <T_5> this only <T_3> with another <T_0> .
<T_4> as <T_1> electrons go round at the <T_0> of <T_3> , <T_2> shed x-rays .
<T_2> are <T_0> the money side <T_1> the time .
<T_7> is -- i <T_6> found <T_3> ; hand lettering &apos;s coming <T_2> in a big way , <T_4> i <T_5> this <T_1> a <T_0> example <T_8> both .
interestingly , i <T_3> that <T_0> &apos;s considered that <T_2> design <T_5> in <T_1> design collection , <T_7> you see <T_4> what you <T_6> .
<T_4> : <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> wonderful <T_3> , which is why <T_1> love him . but ...
<T_3> i &apos;m going to <T_2> you what that does <T_1> our <T_0> .
i &apos;ve got <T_2> piece of <T_3> and it <T_1> terroir <T_0> you wouldn &apos;t believe .
he <T_1> , &quot; <T_4> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> my <T_3> , i &apos;m <T_5> . &quot;
<T_2> you could <T_0> somebody &apos;s attention , what <T_1> you do <T_3> it ?
<T_3> is <T_1> really a <T_2> so much <T_0> it is a dialogue .
<T_1> it really <T_2> border <T_0> the map ?
i <T_3> what it <T_1> to <T_0> , <T_6> i feel that if there is <T_4> crime , a person <T_2> be tried <T_5> and <T_7> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;ve got <T_0> pretty amazing neurology <T_2> other people . &quot;
it can be <T_0> . <T_2> can reveal <T_3> astonishing <T_1> .
i &apos;ve signed <T_0> wonderful <T_2> book <T_1> .
<T_9> my <T_4> example of that -- which is <T_0> really widely <T_6> as a <T_1> miracle , but <T_2> may be one of <T_8> greatest of all <T_7> , was the scaling up of <T_3> in the <T_5> world war .
<T_1> , if <T_0> &apos;re honest , a <T_2> .
<T_5> the <T_0> won &apos;t set us free <T_6> we develop <T_4> skills and <T_3> habit and the <T_1> and <T_2> moral <T_8> to <T_7> it .
<T_2> &apos;ll walk <T_1> dog right through that six part series <T_0> the balkans .
in his <T_8> , paul charges <T_0> and industry as , one , <T_6> major <T_7> causing the decline of <T_4> biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is <T_2> enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful <T_9> , <T_1> really lead <T_3> out of this <T_5> .
i &apos;m not doing <T_1> bad <T_0> anything illegal .
i didn &apos;t want <T_4> know <T_0> i was <T_2> girl , <T_3> they <T_1> &apos;t .
i think <T_2> should <T_3> it -- <T_4> that <T_1> &apos;ve got three <T_0> .
<T_1> thinking about <T_2> , it turns <T_0> appearances matter .
and , all <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;m <T_4> of <T_0> the metaphor a little <T_2> .
the mall <T_0> a <T_1> of american <T_2> .
so , <T_2> see <T_0> galaxy because <T_1> star light .
<T_4> , <T_2> &apos;s much more <T_1> if you can get <T_3> to do <T_0> bidding .
check <T_0> .
next <T_3> wrap the entire <T_6> -- almost <T_1> this olivetti keyboard -- <T_4> a material , with a wood material that basically covers <T_7> the <T_0> : <T_2> , ceiling , <T_9> , <T_8> , <T_5> , everything , boxes .
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_0> how many <T_1> there are in our <T_2> galaxy .
&quot; <T_7> mother , &quot; she <T_3> , &quot; <T_0> mother <T_2> &apos;t <T_6> a fight , <T_1> she <T_5> really <T_4> at them . &quot;
david <T_1> was going to debate <T_2> on this , and <T_0> i <T_3> in , <T_5> crowd of a hundred started booing <T_4> .
it &apos;s not just <T_3> root supplying a plant , but for each of <T_8> plants , whatever it is -- a <T_7> , <T_6> analysis , somebody &apos;s looking for patterns in the <T_1> -- they get to <T_0> at all the data <T_9> they get it connected together , and <T_2> really important thing about <T_4> is the more things you have to <T_5> together , the more powerful it is .
there <T_0> such a <T_2> within sub-saharan <T_1> .
and in <T_6> ways , <T_3> try to <T_5> the mishaps ; <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> challenge <T_7> photography <T_4> these things all take place in a <T_1> of a second .

now <T_3> chirp <T_2> very characteristic <T_1> black <T_5> -- <T_4> it <T_0> up at the end .
so <T_6> my village now , kids there , <T_9> normally listen to bbc , or any radio , and they are waiting to <T_1> , the <T_3> emmanuel will <T_2> his breakfast <T_0> means <T_8> got <T_5> money <T_4> build our <T_7> .
<T_1> reader : &quot; <T_0> you &apos;ve <T_2> &quot;
you <T_0> &apos;t want to build a <T_3> bomb , and you happen <T_1> get one of those <T_2> nuclear warheads <T_4> exist .
<T_4> you saw <T_5> katrina is a <T_7> good indicator <T_1> how little <T_2> the <T_6> states is <T_3> any kind of <T_0> attack .
<T_1> looked at the <T_2> to <T_0> places .

<T_7> gray market &apos;s <T_5> big <T_2> . <T_8> one of <T_0> ways -- <T_3> one -- but <T_1> of the ways to help <T_6> the case of the gray market <T_4> to make something that is so utterly <T_9> .
now <T_3> can <T_5> to reduce <T_0> home <T_2> bill by <T_6> cycling <T_1> loads <T_4> air conditioners and heaters .
you <T_5> dial in <T_0> calories going into <T_2> and <T_1> going <T_4> , when <T_3> can take a shower .
that &apos;s <T_0> linares , <T_1> renowned flamenco <T_2> .
and i &apos;m <T_4> a <T_1> trick <T_7> say , what <T_5> we looked at <T_2> universe <T_6> our culture <T_9> the <T_3> of technology ? <T_0> does <T_8> want ?
here .
<T_0> one of <T_1> principles is <T_2> .
and <T_2> are nonverbal expressions <T_0> power <T_1> dominance ?
so , let <T_1> show <T_4> a <T_2> of <T_0> form of <T_3> .
<T_5> a <T_7> more relevant question -- <T_0> mit <T_8> evelyn <T_2> keller <T_1> it -- is , &quot; <T_6> if <T_4> scientists are <T_3> ? &quot;
and <T_7> i <T_4> get <T_6> heaven , <T_3> will be because i held my piece <T_1> 45 minutes <T_2> did not <T_0> my <T_5> .
there is <T_2> in my <T_0> that would land <T_1> here .
i &apos;d like for you to <T_1> it <T_0> your <T_2> .
well , <T_7> if <T_6> go to madison <T_8> park , and we imagine it without <T_3> the cars , and <T_4> instead <T_2> large forests , <T_5> streams <T_1> of <T_9> and <T_0> drains ?
so , the most <T_3> africans <T_0> up going to work for <T_7> , <T_9> that <T_5> increased the <T_6> tensions <T_1> our <T_8> precisely <T_2> we depend on <T_4> .
and <T_0> let <T_3> show you now the <T_1> of <T_2> bridge .
<T_3> of these <T_2> are made out of <T_1> concrete and <T_0> .
put the little <T_0> in your pocket or in your backpack , and <T_3> me how <T_2> questions you got <T_1> . &quot;
in the <T_1> 2007 , <T_3> started a partnership <T_4> the <T_2> state department <T_0> corrections .
because <T_5> you <T_3> do <T_4> take your <T_0> , <T_7> turn it <T_1> a problem <T_8> someone <T_6> has solved , and use <T_2> solutions .
and <T_2> comes <T_3> to <T_0> diabetes <T_1> i was telling you .
<T_1> are <T_4> bad <T_0> , just <T_2> there are no bad <T_3> .
and <T_1> astrolabes come <T_2> many <T_0> sizes <T_3> shapes and forms .
<T_2> we understand very <T_0> about <T_1> human <T_3> .
the <T_3> , more honest <T_0> is to actually <T_1> the <T_2> .
ted <T_3> &apos;s got <T_1> . <T_2> jobs has <T_0> .
except if <T_2> locked <T_5> doors and <T_4> us <T_1> literally <T_0> , <T_3> would happen .
now how <T_0> would that <T_1> ?
<T_2> by now it &apos;s <T_3> to <T_0> in this <T_4> . you &apos;re <T_1> .
<T_0> know <T_1> .
we can <T_5> that <T_2> of <T_6> , because <T_1> their forefathers , <T_0> could get the <T_4> engineering college <T_3> 1847 .
<T_0> of peer learning .
<T_4> it is <T_1> data . i <T_2> talk about <T_0> kinds <T_3> data .
<T_1> what &apos;s the weight of <T_0> equipment you &apos;re <T_2> ?
now , here <T_4> two <T_0> people , <T_3> immediately <T_2> , three <T_1> people .
audience : five . five .
<T_3> yet <T_2> carry on <T_4> walls <T_0> keep us <T_1> .
it <T_4> a lot of <T_8> , a lot of <T_1> , and <T_3> , even <T_0> a <T_9> hits <T_5> market , it acts in an <T_6> way <T_7> actually hurts <T_2> .
what do <T_1> think <T_0> the <T_2> ? &quot;
<T_1> we <T_2> on sailing and we arrived at <T_0> north pole .
<T_3> you see <T_2> books you <T_4> signed for <T_1> wife and <T_0> three daughters ? &quot;
between australia and here , right , they &apos;ve got <T_4> and we &apos;ve got <T_5> , and what -- does the earth kind of rush <T_8> the <T_3> at night , and then rush back again ? i <T_7> , it &apos;s <T_9> very strange thing going on , and <T_6> hold these two models <T_1> our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we <T_2> that , as human <T_0> , in all sorts of fields .
well , whatever <T_2> is , meditation <T_1> the <T_6> , the <T_4> to <T_7> back and to get a <T_3> perspective , to <T_9> that <T_8> aren &apos;t <T_5> as <T_0> appear .
i &apos;m <T_1> very <T_6> that in <T_4> next decades , <T_0> will make <T_7> strides <T_3> reducing that <T_2> rate that has <T_8> so challenging in this <T_5> .
people have been asking <T_1> question for <T_0> long time .
<T_0> census actually <T_4> to look back <T_3> time , using <T_1> source of information they <T_2> get their hands on .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> light years &apos; <T_1> of <T_2> , so we &apos;re not going to do this .
<T_6> &apos;m <T_2> to laugh <T_0> , <T_3> you do look <T_5> different <T_1> you did in haight-ashbury <T_4> the &apos; 60s .
and <T_0> assure you <T_3> &apos;s every bit as <T_5> to <T_1> as it might have been to <T_4> and <T_2> .
so i <T_4> three months in <T_1> , <T_2> and <T_7> interviewing <T_3> that had <T_5> 100 dollars <T_0> start or grow a <T_6> .
now , if you do <T_1> economic <T_7> and <T_2> what would <T_9> if <T_5> fish were not <T_4> , if we brought just 20 divers one month per <T_6> , <T_3> revenue would be more than 20 times <T_0> and that would be <T_8> over time .
who <T_1> whisk away the thought of the <T_4> unlikely mouse <T_7> along <T_0> cold water <T_3> behind <T_8> floral <T_2> , gripping <T_9> single wooden match <T_6> the needles of his <T_5> ?
so what we &apos;d like to <T_8> is that we use them <T_0> involve <T_5> from all around the world <T_4> an historic <T_7> : <T_9> world &apos;s first <T_1> global <T_3> and consultation , where <T_2> everywhere has an equal voice for the very <T_6> time .
it &apos;s <T_0> all of us to <T_1> .
i <T_1> that <T_2> would have <T_0> of <T_3> family .
in <T_9> where <T_8> in my crew gets their <T_2> room <T_7> there &apos;s no wireless , and in punk squats , everyone on <T_3> floor <T_0> one room with no <T_5> but <T_4> wireless , <T_6> making it the <T_1> option .
<T_3> i <T_0> he will <T_1> his <T_2> soon .
and <T_0> is even used <T_4> sensitive <T_1> such as building <T_2> around gender-based <T_3> .
you can <T_3> echoes of <T_0> interpretation <T_4> john <T_1> &apos;s &quot; <T_2> lost . &quot;
it &apos;s a <T_2> ; of course they <T_1> &apos;t want to <T_0> that .
so <T_0> you think we &apos;re starting <T_2> question and disrupt and interrogate what <T_1> means , then the ultimate extension of that is , is there <T_5> reason <T_3> the <T_6> to be in charge of money <T_4> ?
<T_0> is entirely <T_1> .
but <T_0> got a clean <T_2> curve , <T_3> exactly the <T_4> as what <T_1> would get in <T_5> school .
<T_2> what they do is they put <T_0> back in , in <T_1> to <T_4> the <T_3> .
of <T_2> , <T_4> couldn &apos;t have a classroom <T_3> with <T_1> of students , so we <T_5> and <T_0> these online forums .
and finally , <T_7> future <T_1> , there are telescopes being designed specifically <T_3> address the questions <T_4> dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes , and <T_5> are <T_8> space-based telescopes that <T_9> in competition right now <T_6> be launched to investigate dark <T_2> and dark <T_0> .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at <T_1> fourth <T_0> fifth <T_3> , which <T_5> innovation , competitions <T_2> social <T_4> .
<T_1> you &apos;ve got that <T_0> .
<T_6> &apos;re <T_0> robocop , and you &apos;re not <T_5> , but <T_3> &apos;re <T_8> every time <T_7> look at <T_4> computer screen <T_2> use one of your cell phone <T_1> .
we &apos;ve been able to see <T_1> single <T_0> .
<T_0> aylward : <T_1> . <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;s almost been eradicated .
<T_6> &apos;d <T_4> to play you some <T_0> of little <T_5> from <T_8> two-and-a-half <T_7> of research <T_9> we <T_2> -- actually , <T_1> of the <T_3> are more recent .
or about <T_4> millions of other <T_5> who start <T_1> and sometimes <T_2> , <T_3> continue to <T_0> ?
so <T_2> &apos;m a researcher-storyteller , and <T_3> &apos;m going to talk <T_8> you today -- we &apos;re talking about <T_9> perception -- and so i want to talk to you and <T_6> some stories about a <T_0> of my research that fundamentally expanded <T_4> perception and <T_1> actually changed the <T_7> that i live and love and work <T_5> parent .
some of these <T_4> created by the <T_3> , others <T_0> other <T_1> and <T_2> sent over here .
and of course , <T_5> last thing i &apos;m going <T_0> talk about is <T_4> to reach <T_2> intermediate step , <T_7> point <T_6> maybe <T_3> years life <T_1> .
<T_2> the <T_0> to that is <T_1> .
<T_1> do i have something <T_2> with <T_0> equipment ? &quot;
<T_1> have to work <T_0> .
and <T_5> is that <T_0> museums are usually passive , <T_6> have passive relationships <T_1> the museum <T_3> the presenter <T_2> the <T_4> , as the <T_8> of <T_7> .
<T_1> , <T_4> -- well , <T_3> has kind of <T_0> right-leaning <T_2> .
government-approved , american <T_2> society , <T_0> patients <T_3> what patients <T_1> to know .
<T_4> numbers <T_2> by <T_5> pouring in from <T_3> and over <T_1> lake <T_0> congo .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> static .
<T_3> , <T_1> &apos;s a <T_0> subject , both in our <T_4> and our philosophical <T_2> .
the <T_0> embargo -- if ever <T_1> submitted to &quot; <T_3> , &quot; hopefully , it will be <T_4> . <T_2>
<T_6> five <T_2> , in just under a <T_5> , <T_1> had thousands of <T_4> fans <T_3> and see them <T_0> .
now , another idea , <T_4> way of <T_3> is <T_1> in space , having different <T_0> of a <T_2> do different <T_5> at the same time .
and <T_2> is <T_4> living <T_3> that has a mass of at <T_1> 2,000 <T_0> .
<T_0> very extreme <T_1> .
number <T_1> : take a good <T_0> at what &apos;s inside <T_5> own <T_4> and <T_3> you put <T_2> there .
<T_2> el-khalil : making peace <T_0> a <T_1>
<T_3> &apos;ve become uncomfortable when <T_1> &apos;m <T_2> from <T_0> laptop .
our <T_4> , our soldiers , <T_3> on a <T_5> now , almost <T_2> go to <T_0> with <T_1> .
<T_2> this is all the kind of <T_1> we are giving <T_4> , we are <T_0> away to the <T_3> states .
so <T_5> thought , &quot; i <T_7> take the <T_8> and put them <T_1> this piece of <T_0> , then clean <T_4> dog &apos;s wounds , <T_9> then <T_6> &apos;ll figure out <T_3> to do with the <T_2> . &quot;
it <T_0> compute . it <T_1> &apos;t just <T_2> . <T_4> could do <T_3> .
<T_2> there <T_1> a slight <T_0> .
<T_3> is <T_5> presented as <T_7> one <T_4> that <T_1> took through , but really it represents <T_6> huge <T_0> of <T_2> .
i &apos;ve carried <T_1> photograph with <T_0> every day since then .
now <T_3> had <T_1> start <T_5> these <T_6> and converting <T_4> from using that <T_2> a livelihood , to <T_0> something <T_7> .
he was the most <T_1> scientist <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_2> tanked . <T_0> one ever <T_1> it .
<T_1> makes <T_0> dynamic inconsistency happen ?
<T_0> &apos;m <T_1> hendry . i am <T_2> .
sixty-four , that <T_1> one at <T_6> age , <T_7> gender , could ever <T_8> , has done it , and there &apos;s no <T_5> in my mind <T_4> i am <T_0> the <T_3> of my life <T_2> .
one <T_3> was <T_2> robot <T_0> saw there , <T_1> .
<T_8> is <T_7> forensic anthropology research facility , and <T_6> a six <T_0> plot there <T_1> approximately <T_5> cadavers at any given time that are being studied <T_9> forensic anthropologists and <T_3> who are <T_2> in <T_4> a rate of corpse decomposition .
i <T_2> half my life at <T_0> local <T_3> store <T_1> the months when we <T_4> these units originally .
well <T_5> , <T_0> . now <T_1> is worth plus-one <T_6> resilience , which means that <T_3> body can <T_4> more <T_7> and <T_2> itself faster .
he &apos;d always walk up to <T_2> airplane in a kind of <T_1> , devil-may-care <T_3> , flick <T_4> cigarette <T_7> , grab <T_0> girl <T_8> here , give <T_6> a <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> original . &#91; <T_0> &#93; <T_1> &apos;s the <T_3> together .
and <T_3> identities , those <T_0> identities , <T_2> have almost always <T_1> to cure .
<T_4> do <T_7> do it <T_5> ? <T_3> it or <T_0> , they <T_2> on <T_1> intermolecular forces , <T_6> van der waals forces .
and <T_0> have a <T_2> video that <T_1> the <T_3> .
<T_5> are lines of <T_4> power consumption <T_1> unit area , which <T_3> measure in <T_2> per <T_0> meter .
these <T_8> could <T_2> contemplate <T_6> up the <T_7> , <T_1> to do so would have gone contrary <T_0> everything they had been taught and everything they <T_5> come to believe <T_4> the power <T_3> purpose of <T_9> .
i &apos;m really <T_8> by that . <T_9> anyway <T_4> &apos;s -- the basis of the <T_2> that i <T_5> to share with <T_1> today , though , <T_6> that right back <T_3> where we inspire <T_0> who will be our <T_7> leaders later .
<T_8> could fly <T_4> ph.d. students under <T_0> umbrella of <T_2> concept , because <T_3> supposition is that <T_5> fungi , prior <T_9> sporulation , <T_1> the very insects that are otherwise repelled <T_7> those <T_6> .
<T_2> , mexico <T_4> others are <T_5> making experimental flu vaccines , <T_3> they may be the <T_0> place we see these <T_1> in use .
after <T_2> swam the <T_5> , lewis pugh vowed never <T_6> take another cold-water <T_3> . then <T_0> heard of lake imja in <T_1> himalayas , created by recent <T_9> melting , and lake pumori , a body of water at an altitude <T_7> 5300 m <T_8> everest -- and so began a journey that would teach <T_4> a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
but <T_1> licensed <T_2> are the <T_3> big <T_0> in education .
<T_1> nation , <T_0> system .
and the <T_4> , but <T_3> all-important , <T_0> of <T_2> and survival of the <T_7> shrinks just <T_6> little <T_5> to make <T_1> .
and <T_2> really discovered <T_1> my professors weren &apos;t <T_0> wrong .
<T_1> found <T_0> sample to be able to get <T_2> culture .
<T_1> compost bins -- go through about <T_3> kilos of <T_5> vegetable waste <T_4> week -- <T_2> good , <T_6> fantastic <T_0> .
i came up with <T_6> number <T_0> after <T_3> actually <T_5> &apos;t plan <T_2> a <T_7> , <T_8> went about <T_1> feet and cracked <T_4> rib .
they &apos;re really <T_0> resolution , and they &apos;re really showing <T_3> what <T_2> can do <T_4> standard <T_1> cards today .
<T_0> they survived their <T_1> , we <T_3> do it <T_2> .
so <T_1> , i &apos;ve been pretty <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s 15 <T_1> older <T_2> jay .
<T_2> of the national school lunch program being under <T_0> usda , i think <T_1> should be under cdc .
<T_3> a <T_4> a <T_0> a , suggesting that <T_2> is an <T_1> in itself .
so a <T_3> of <T_5> based <T_1> natural <T_6> requires a <T_0> notion of <T_2> are the properties of <T_4> systems .
i <T_5> good <T_3> that <T_6> , and <T_2> stand <T_0> today cancer-free , walking <T_1> aid and hobbling <T_4> .
<T_1> don &apos;t know <T_0> any of these <T_2> mean .
<T_2> were <T_0> difficult <T_3> in the <T_1> of this thing .
but <T_2> an <T_4> gun , <T_5> even <T_0> best <T_3> in the <T_1> forces could have hit the mark .
<T_6> have used the <T_0> of their <T_4> to begin to redirect <T_3> energy <T_1> another <T_5> and <T_2> trajectory .
i &apos;ve taken <T_0> ideas from <T_2> starrs and from <T_1> other <T_3> i met .
sometimes what happens <T_1> life affects <T_3> choice <T_4> objects <T_0> i try <T_2> work <T_5> .
do you know <T_1> it &apos;s three <T_0> 100,000 ?
but really , <T_1> we &apos;re <T_6> going to be honest with <T_4> , i <T_3> to <T_2> that achieving <T_5> end of the <T_7> was <T_8> the <T_0> of the exercise to begin with , was it .
i <T_1> them to name <T_2> just <T_0> .
<T_1> he <T_4> -- he <T_2> on a <T_0> like <T_5> , and he demonstrated this <T_3> .
<T_0> movement , ultimately , only has <T_1> meaning <T_3> you have <T_2> home <T_5> go back <T_4> .
so if you &apos;re <T_4> namibia <T_6> coca-cola , and you have a <T_8> constituencies , you know <T_3> every can versus <T_1> of <T_7> , fanta or <T_2> was sold , whether it was a corner <T_9> , <T_5> supermarket or <T_0> pushcart .
<T_0> universe <T_1> not only <T_2> .
<T_1> was <T_2> strange <T_4> me to do <T_0> of social <T_3> .
<T_1> what it looks like <T_0> my desk <T_2>
so <T_5> are people who expect <T_2> kisses <T_1> their <T_3> , <T_0> strolls <T_4> the park .
perk up .
<T_2> was <T_1> little <T_3> than <T_0> you usually do .
and <T_0> two <T_1> are named guier <T_2> weiffenbach .
<T_0> first one <T_2> getting along well <T_1> others .
and at some <T_0> he &apos;s dancing <T_2> his -- <T_3> i won &apos;t ruin <T_1> episode for you , from 1967 .
<T_1> it , we would have no <T_0> .
you <T_0> are looking good <T_1> there .
<T_2> me of <T_1> set of threes that my <T_0> tried to get <T_3> to us .
<T_0> he said <T_2> such a long <T_1> ago .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> ironic . and i &apos;ll show <T_3> a little <T_1> recursion here .
<T_0> difference between <T_4> dinosaurs and <T_5> is that <T_2> have a space program and we can <T_3> , <T_1> so we <T_7> change <T_6> future .
after we had done that with a <T_4> large <T_3> of people <T_0> discovered what we thought the <T_8> issues were with girls and boys and <T_1> -- because , after all , that &apos;s really <T_9> this is about -- <T_5> moved to the second phase of our work , where <T_7> interviewed adult experts in academia , some <T_6> the people who &apos;d produced the literature that we <T_2> relevant .
<T_2> last for about <T_0> miles , in which <T_3> we put our foot back <T_1> the pedal .
so , <T_2> we could <T_1> that and <T_3> we <T_0> put <T_4> into this .
another <T_0> is a <T_1> animal called the european aurochs <T_2>
<T_2> nose -- you can see his nose <T_0> flared <T_1> now .
<T_3> i &apos;ve got <T_4> live demonstration <T_2> here <T_1> show this <T_0> you .
or <T_5> , who can &apos;t go <T_2> school , <T_8> his immune <T_6> daughter can &apos;t be risked <T_3> have <T_7> come into the <T_0> , so he <T_9> &apos;t <T_4> the <T_1> .
nature provides <T_2> first <T_1> , <T_3> experience <T_0> revises .
<T_3> &apos;s the <T_0> i <T_2> that <T_1> the father . &quot;
<T_1> actually have a very <T_0> payload on there .
<T_7> many of us <T_5> , as <T_6> in the <T_1> , spend <T_0> of our time in <T_4> bottom <T_2> of this equation , in the <T_3> ?
<T_3> have <T_0> wishes . <T_2> , i <T_4> &apos;t do much <T_1> africa .
<T_4> the <T_3> 10 people <T_5> see on the <T_7> , &quot; <T_8> , <T_1> you think it &apos;s <T_6> to spend billions of <T_2> francs looking for <T_0> higgs <T_9> ? &quot;
so what <T_0> we <T_1> ?
<T_4> : yeah , i think i was <T_5> bit of a <T_0> and -- <T_2> i ... and i was , yeah , i was fortunately <T_3> at <T_7> , and <T_6> at least <T_1> had something to excel at , at school .
<T_5> the <T_0> that <T_1> really confusing to me was , <T_2> do <T_6> maintain <T_4> in the face <T_3> reality ?
<T_0> just <T_1> mailing <T_2> to our friends .
<T_0> is <T_2> first time <T_1> my game . <T_3> .
we &apos;re <T_0> to <T_1> them out . they &apos;ll probably all <T_2> .
<T_2> : did anyone get <T_0> ? <T_1> : <T_3> .
<T_1> smoldering <T_0> .
<T_5> meet <T_0> all the time who <T_3> those , <T_2> they &apos;re <T_4> necessarily <T_1> .
<T_7> tells <T_9> that <T_2> students come to us from <T_8> , <T_6> may <T_1> be giving them enough credit for what <T_3> know , and <T_4> know it <T_0> their <T_5> language .
tom <T_1> , in <T_3> recent <T_4> york <T_2> article , captured , in the way that no one else could , the <T_5> behind <T_0> effort .
so in many , many <T_0> , we can <T_4> things today <T_3> we <T_6> &apos;t do <T_1> i <T_2> in <T_5> .
<T_3> there &apos;s so <T_2> creative <T_1> that &apos;s just <T_0> at the bottom .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> model of <T_0> here .
<T_0> , maybe <T_9> can run <T_5> clinical <T_2> with <T_1> or five of these , and if <T_4> goes well , <T_6> years <T_3> you <T_7> , you will get <T_8> approval .
he &apos;s sitting <T_0> .
<T_1> this <T_0> is also <T_2> .
<T_1> we have <T_4> bud <T_0> guy who &apos;s the <T_3> couch <T_2> .
so , it <T_0> under the <T_1> .
<T_1> all <T_3> , <T_4> is approximately 45 <T_0> away from <T_2> destruction . right ?
a <T_0> jelly <T_1> .
<T_3> is <T_7> of the <T_4> agronomists <T_6> malawi , <T_8> kumbira , and <T_9> &apos;s discussing what <T_0> they will plant -- the best converter <T_2> sunshine to <T_1> that <T_5> has found .
<T_2> the camera <T_3> down <T_0> her , and this <T_5> has to put <T_8> microphone in <T_6> face , <T_7> , &quot; <T_4> do <T_1> mean by that ? &quot;
it &apos;s a <T_0> percent open rate <T_5> if <T_3> doesn &apos;t <T_6> to you when you ask <T_2> when <T_7> &apos;s coming <T_1> for <T_4> .
and <T_1> know <T_7> point of this conference <T_5> to celebrate <T_2> that <T_6> near and <T_3> to us , <T_9> i <T_4> know <T_0> clean and dirty <T_8> &apos;t opposites .
they &apos;re about <T_0> you <T_6> , how <T_1> people you <T_5> with , <T_3> whether <T_4> own your home <T_2> not .
she <T_0> for <T_4> very <T_1> company , <T_3> workshop <T_2> hyderabad , <T_5> furnitures .
<T_1> it <T_0> like this .
all the <T_2> , we also wanted <T_1> give back to the local tech community <T_0> helped us <T_4> ushahidi and supported <T_3> in those <T_5> days .
<T_4> what you <T_5> then also begin to do is <T_1> say , &quot; how <T_3> these <T_0> differences distributed across <T_2> world ? &quot;
in <T_4> typical year <T_0> texas , <T_1> &apos;re averaging about two <T_2> a <T_3> .
<T_5> think <T_4> can <T_0> the driving <T_3> by letting <T_1> cars talk to <T_2> other .
so <T_0> do <T_2> go in <T_1> ?
so what that <T_1> is , <T_4> could use <T_0> to read all of the books <T_3> a click <T_2> a button .
<T_2> feels <T_1> touch down <T_0> one gram of <T_3> .
david lang <T_1> who taught himself to become an amateur oceanographer -- or , <T_0> taught a robot to <T_6> one for him . in a <T_7> talk lang , a fellow , <T_8> how he and a <T_2> of <T_9> lovers <T_4> up to build open-sourced <T_5> low-cost underwater explorers <T_3>
<T_2> have <T_0> them <T_1> , hygiene .
long <T_0> , <T_1> brownian <T_2> , 1.33 .
<T_1> &apos;m <T_6> at <T_4> time he did <T_8> , i didn &apos;t -- it didn &apos;t -- well , <T_0> , <T_5> guess in the hidden <T_3> of mind , it <T_7> out years <T_2> .
a <T_2> of this is driven <T_1> what &apos;s happening in <T_0> .
<T_1> think the <T_2> promising way <T_0> to go for biomarkers .
so the <T_0> point <T_1> take <T_3> virtually <T_2> that <T_4> will see .
<T_1> almost brought the <T_2> financial <T_0> down .
i <T_0> exactly <T_1> he did <T_2> ; <T_4> &apos;ve seen <T_3> drawings .
the <T_4> person to do <T_6> systematically was <T_9> , carl <T_3> linne , a <T_5> botanist , <T_1> in <T_2> eighteenth century took it upon <T_7> to categorize <T_8> living <T_0> on the planet .
thank <T_2> for letting <T_1> be <T_0> storyteller today .
<T_1> know <T_0> story .
because <T_3> want to show <T_1> is a mass <T_0> as <T_4> a region <T_2> possible .
<T_4> imagine <T_5> time <T_3> too far <T_6> now -- <T_2> mom <T_8> go to <T_1> computer , open up a <T_0> and jack <T_7> a little <T_9> .
<T_0> interact with <T_1> .

<T_3> spectacular <T_0> theseus , who entered <T_2> labyrinth <T_1> killed the bull-headed <T_4> .
<T_3> , if i <T_1> too <T_0> talking to you , then there &apos;s no way <T_5> can <T_2> on <T_6> balls . i &apos;m going to <T_4> them .
and <T_1> you see this <T_0> junior high a <T_2> .
<T_2> smoot : <T_1> design of the <T_0>
and here <T_1> the <T_0> century <T_2> .
<T_4> we <T_0> know that the <T_8> has <T_3> in other ways , that since <T_2> there are one-third <T_1> many <T_7> countries that exist <T_5> independent entities <T_6> the <T_9> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> only <T_0> phenomenon .
the <T_6> is <T_5> better equipped to overcome <T_1> increase in <T_9> price of oil <T_0> , <T_3> ever in <T_4> past , <T_2> of <T_8> i &apos;m <T_7> about .
<T_4> is <T_5> first time <T_1> son took more than <T_0> steps <T_2> once -- captured <T_3> film .
<T_3> you look at it , you &apos;re going to be <T_0> , <T_1> temporarily or <T_2> .
but <T_4> polyp would <T_1> and tell <T_2> that his neighbors were quite <T_0> identical <T_3> of <T_5> .
<T_2> work has been done <T_0> an extraordinary <T_7> of people , and <T_1> &apos;ve <T_9> all <T_4> work , <T_6> i &apos;m the <T_8> bullshitter that <T_3> to bring it all <T_5> .
i have looked at the <T_0> and i &apos;ve look at <T_2> of the <T_1> .
it &apos;s <T_3> about making <T_0> that have <T_6> most media <T_4> , <T_5> it &apos;s about making places <T_1> we can actually do <T_7> most <T_2> .
actually , the first time we <T_1> more than one <T_0> -- a hundred brain <T_4> simultaneously -- we <T_7> measure <T_5> electrical sparks of a <T_8> cells in <T_9> same animal , <T_3> is the first image we got , the first <T_2> seconds of <T_6> recording .
<T_1> when <T_8> looked at that <T_5> , it was <T_7> other than <T_3> equation <T_2> scientists <T_6> long known <T_4> describe <T_0> electromagnetic force .
the <T_3> thing we did was we took a <T_8> bicycle mirror <T_5> we band-aided it here , onto a gurney , a <T_9> trolley , so <T_2> when you <T_1> wheeled around by <T_4> nurse or by a <T_6> , you could <T_0> have a conversation with <T_7> .
but <T_3> then , much <T_1> has been made , both <T_2> our <T_4> and other <T_5> around <T_0> world .
now , the <T_2> we had is , <T_1> general <T_3> a distributed <T_0> ?
and my <T_0> step in this direction <T_4> to develop <T_3> new model of <T_6> cord injury that would more closely mimic some of <T_5> features of <T_1> injury while offering well-controlled <T_2> conditions .
these matter particles all interact <T_0> the various <T_1> particles .
no <T_2> was possible <T_1> him , except a few <T_4> here , a <T_0> weeks <T_3> .
so <T_3> luck . <T_2> &apos;re <T_1> in this with <T_0> .
and <T_2> would <T_3> through and <T_0> , what was <T_1> ?
<T_8> youtube , <T_6> was <T_2> way <T_0> him <T_7> discover his sport &apos;s true <T_3> , because <T_1> can &apos;t <T_4> this stuff <T_5> words , right ?
<T_1> &apos;s <T_3> about it . he <T_0> his <T_2> in now .
in <T_3> example , <T_2> electrical <T_4> , <T_6> deflection <T_1> the <T_5> , is caused by a <T_0> pulse of light .
in turn , students , <T_0> from <T_1> the <T_2> , would <T_3> .
<T_1> can be put in a <T_0> compartment , ok .
i <T_0> &apos;t have to <T_1> in it .
<T_2> many <T_0> you have <T_1> ?
and <T_3> asked the <T_4> in kuwait where <T_2> thought these <T_1> took <T_0> .
<T_3> i said , <T_2> can be done with only <T_1> people , and with <T_0> minimum <T_4> of time .
<T_8> if you <T_6> here when <T_3> figured out how to crack the code <T_4> create <T_7> paying <T_0> in america -- -- and get <T_9> energy policy and we created <T_5> national energy strategy <T_1> the bottom <T_2> ?
<T_4> love <T_5> brooklyn dodgers , as <T_1> do , but i <T_2> you some <T_3> they will <T_0> fairly <T_6> squarely .
and <T_0> you can put <T_6> , i &apos;ll call them <T_7> , <T_1> the offspring will actually die at <T_4> stages , but <T_3> &apos;ll call <T_2> sterile <T_5> now .
<T_0> &apos;s where <T_1> of vietnam &apos;s rice is <T_2> .
another thing that <T_0> interesting is <T_1> the brain <T_5> that <T_4> have is shared with <T_3> variety of other <T_2> .
it &apos;s 2013 , <T_6> 2.5 <T_4> people in the <T_9> have no access to a basic sanitary toilet . and when there &apos;s no <T_8> , where do you <T_0> ? in the street , probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination . get ready for <T_1> blunt , <T_2> , powerful talk from journalist rose <T_7> about <T_5> once-unmentionable <T_3> .
so <T_4> hate <T_0> put a timeline <T_3> scientific innovation , <T_6> the <T_1> that have occurred <T_5> now paying <T_2> .
common <T_1> , <T_0> important <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s a real simple <T_1> .
well , <T_0> only <T_3> to experience zero-g <T_1> earth is actually <T_5> parabolic <T_2> , <T_4> flight .
i <T_4> at the door of <T_1> wonderful <T_0> , reggie <T_2> , <T_3> share <T_5> new idea .
and <T_1> can <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;s kind of pollinating , <T_0> , <T_4> .
his <T_2> , chandrabhan and <T_0> , were also listed <T_1> dead .
population growth &apos;s <T_4> , <T_2> it &apos;s <T_0> about how <T_1> each <T_3> consumes .
euvin naidoo : why <T_1> in <T_0>
now my <T_1> was <T_0> .
<T_3> have <T_1> staff ; <T_4> &apos;s all kind of made by <T_5> -- <T_0> sort of <T_2> hands .
<T_1> de luxe &apos;s giant <T_0> come <T_3> a city <T_5> they live <T_4> for a few <T_2> .
and it &apos;s true <T_5> an <T_6> of prevention equals <T_2> pound of <T_3> , <T_7> that &apos;s only <T_1> we <T_4> what to <T_0> .
<T_2> kamkwamba : <T_0> i harnessed <T_1> wind
and <T_0> you &apos;re <T_2> , please <T_1> away <T_3> .
<T_3> carr-chellman : <T_1> to re-engage <T_0> in <T_2>
thank you all very <T_0> .
<T_0> mean , obviously <T_2> orchestra musicians <T_1> , the vienna philharmonic <T_3> .
and you can <T_1> a <T_0> more <T_2> .
so <T_2> we had <T_6> design a <T_5> cochlear <T_3> , what we would <T_0> to do is <T_7> it to be able <T_1> allow <T_4> transmission .
i <T_2> , &quot; you &apos;re thinking <T_1> this just way <T_0> early . &quot;
<T_0> , <T_7> now in <T_6> united states , 50 <T_1> 100,000 people die <T_2> year <T_3> air pollution , <T_8> vehicles are <T_4> 25,000 <T_5> those .
<T_2> whole <T_3> world joins <T_1> western world <T_8> good <T_6> survival and small family <T_5> , <T_0> we still <T_4> the poorest <T_7> .
<T_2> fact , <T_1> need <T_0> have hurried .
<T_1> it <T_0> it to you ?
<T_4> , <T_3> a society , we have <T_0> in <T_1> a <T_2> .
<T_0> there <T_4> other <T_2> of light that could <T_3> it into the <T_1> ?
so my idea <T_4> , <T_1> this chap looks at <T_7> object , when he looks at <T_8> -- any object for that matter , it goes to the <T_9> areas <T_3> , however , and <T_6> &apos;s processed in the <T_2> gyrus , <T_0> you recognize it <T_5> a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , ok ?
combining <T_7> wit with artistic <T_5> , billy collins shares a project in which several of <T_6> poems were turned <T_8> delightful animated films <T_4> a collaboration with sundance <T_2> . five of <T_1> are included in this <T_3> entertaining and moving talk -- and don &apos;t <T_0> the <T_9> final poem !
<T_2> : <T_6> made <T_9> bet , i think , two <T_0> three years <T_1> , <T_4> in roughly <T_8> years , i think we &apos;ll see more <T_3> from <T_5> than any <T_7> source .
<T_0> other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this <T_2> process <T_4> a billion <T_3> going to <T_1> .
but <T_0> need to get <T_1> a <T_5> when you &apos;re <T_4> atheist and someone <T_3> , &quot; well you <T_6> , <T_7> did pray the other <T_2> , &quot; you politely <T_8> it .
that &apos;s <T_1> planet <T_2> 750 million <T_0> away .
now , <T_1> has <T_0> ?
we see that in <T_0> , <T_3> percent <T_2> people had secondary school <T_1> .
&quot; i voted <T_1> . <T_2> voted <T_0> .
so thank <T_0> guys .
<T_0> why do they do this ?
i &apos;m a huge <T_0> in hands-on <T_1> .
<T_0> begin <T_4> self-replicate . so in absence of <T_1> reward , <T_3> intrinsic <T_2> is self-replication .
<T_2> the reason the <T_0> don &apos;t do <T_4> is <T_1> they lack <T_3> psychologists <T_6> anthropologists call social <T_5> .
<T_1> enjoy <T_0> bread .
<T_7> then <T_6> goes off and <T_5> the <T_2> because <T_3> &apos;ve been <T_0> to , with a <T_1> people <T_4> along .
but <T_1> , concentrating <T_3> , <T_2> photovoltaics , efficiency and <T_0> .
close your eyes . &quot;
we <T_2> run really far on <T_0> hot <T_1> .
and saying <T_0> you like , <T_1> think , is <T_2> .
<T_1> united <T_0> only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that <T_2> .
and <T_2> are <T_0> of the images from <T_1> .
<T_9> once <T_8> fractionate happiness <T_3> way i do -- <T_4> just positive <T_7> , that &apos;s not <T_5> enough -- <T_2> &apos;s <T_6> in life , and <T_0> &apos;s meaning <T_1> life .
<T_1> you get <T_0> , it <T_2> a bug in your <T_3> .
this <T_1> , sarita <T_7> her <T_3> , <T_2> a 15-dollar <T_5> when <T_6> were living <T_8> a -- literally a three-walled lean-to <T_0> a corrugated <T_4> roof .
so <T_0> modern technology , <T_3> used <T_2> to <T_1> models .
i &apos;ve traveled <T_8> the way from cleveland and <T_6> in east new york , <T_2> the local 6 line up to the hookers of hunt &apos;s point who were in <T_3> way on my way to master <T_4> art <T_0> space , and the one-to-infinite amount of <T_9> , woman and <T_7> you can fit in there only so <T_1> can push them to the back of <T_5> wall with my experience .
so <T_6> united <T_1> did just <T_2> , and they recently issued <T_4> report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this <T_8> for positive was much greater than the risk for <T_3> , and they even looked specifically at <T_5> diybio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , <T_9> the press had a tendency to consistently <T_0> our capabilities <T_7> underestimate our ethics .
so <T_8> thought of <T_0> augmented reality <T_3> using a <T_5> . <T_7> me <T_1> you just simulating <T_9> we <T_4> be doing , any of <T_2> could be doing , in a <T_6> environment .
<T_0> can &apos;t raise <T_1> .
<T_4> companies <T_2> for this , we <T_6> leverage production so <T_3> faster <T_0> by <T_5> for <T_1> to do it .
<T_9> don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m continually amazed to think that two and a half <T_3> of us around the world are connected to each other through the <T_1> and that <T_6> any point in <T_8> more <T_0> 30 percent of the world &apos;s population <T_7> go online to <T_4> , <T_5> create and to <T_2> .
dogs <T_0> better .
but today <T_2> hejaz railway <T_1> in <T_0> , ruins .
<T_5> have <T_2> them set up the kitchen <T_0> now <T_1> are supplying food <T_4> all <T_3> children .
the <T_3> 5,000 <T_5> , it &apos;s not just going to be <T_0> web but only <T_4> -- <T_1> &apos;s going to be <T_2> different .
now , incredible <T_2> you showed <T_0> the <T_1> being <T_3> .
some <T_3> ago i was <T_1> to open <T_0> israel festival by <T_2> high-wire walk .
and then <T_0> became <T_1> .
and you <T_1> count : <T_7> , two , three , <T_3> , <T_9> , <T_8> , <T_6> , <T_0> , nine , <T_5> -- it <T_2> after <T_4> 10th toss .
<T_2> that &apos;s <T_1> serious <T_0> .
<T_5> people started <T_3> believe <T_9> what we were doing , <T_4> actually offered <T_6> hangar space , <T_0> hangar space <T_8> us . <T_1> then <T_2> georgetown airport authority was bent over backwards to help us <T_7> anything we needed .
<T_2> trailer housed two <T_1> , mixer , wet <T_3> , <T_4> , integrated sound <T_0> .
and <T_0> comes <T_3> ending , <T_1> is my favorite part of the <T_2> thing .
<T_1> nelson <T_0> did <T_2> stop there .
and <T_6> &apos;s been <T_4> the face <T_5> in the <T_7> , <T_0> when it &apos;s damaged , you can <T_1> longer <T_2> people &apos;s <T_3> .
so we <T_3> a <T_1> product . <T_0> we <T_2> better information .
now <T_1> &apos;m not <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> exactly <T_0> choice .
jeff <T_1> : <T_2> &apos;m a research <T_3> at nyu <T_0> new <T_4> .
that &apos;s a key <T_8> , <T_4> is decentralization , <T_1> from <T_7> nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized <T_5> that <T_3> environmentally more friendly , a lot <T_6> efficient <T_9> capable <T_2> safe from <T_0> .
<T_3> are <T_1> religious issues -- <T_2> &apos;re <T_0> issues .
i &apos;m <T_2> . i &apos;m a <T_1> , i &apos;m a resident <T_0> i &apos;m a teacher .
i <T_3> a <T_1> named <T_2> billion <T_0> .
<T_3> was <T_8> moving <T_4> of what the words &quot; <T_2> nations &quot; are supposed to <T_6> : a <T_0> union of <T_1> joined together in <T_7> colossal effort <T_5> good .
<T_0> road <T_1> into the <T_2> .
you know , she &apos;s <T_4> smart , <T_1> cut <T_0> , <T_5> primate as well , <T_7> she <T_6> all the stuff <T_2> think might be <T_3> us up .
so as long <T_5> these <T_1> have <T_2> bit of <T_4> they will <T_3> , <T_6> it &apos;s the ice that &apos;s <T_0> .
if <T_4> reach out <T_1> pull an <T_0> , <T_6> neuron will <T_5> , <T_2> me to pull <T_3> object .
dumas <T_1> was <T_0> mississippi originally .
<T_2> by <T_1> , i <T_0> really .
and <T_2> was <T_1> with my <T_0> open .
<T_3> lord god be <T_0> him , <T_1> let <T_2> go up . &apos; &quot; &quot; go up &quot; -- <T_4> .
we <T_4> technology <T_1> applications that <T_2> people &apos;s <T_3> , <T_5> it was <T_0> exciting .
<T_1> do <T_0> do for a living ? &quot;
it &apos;s a deal !
take <T_0> arbitrary <T_6> , long <T_2> , <T_1> , you <T_3> go and have a look <T_5> what recovery money they &apos;ve been spending on different <T_4> such as <T_7> .
but first thing , when <T_1> see dots <T_0> this , you <T_4> to <T_2> yourself : from <T_3> do <T_5> data come ?
<T_1> think we <T_0> a <T_2> problem .
<T_1> you &apos;ve got <T_2> watch <T_0> space for that .
<T_1> name is <T_0> .
i want <T_2> be <T_0> to do <T_3> china &apos;s <T_1> .
and <T_0> it wires itself <T_1> the current <T_2> .
<T_1> is <T_0> , <T_3> you &apos;re <T_2> with any of the telepresence robots <T_5> -- this is <T_4> that <T_6> .
&quot; <T_1> ? &quot; <T_0> said , &quot; <T_2> . &quot;
rb : well , i like to think it <T_5> for <T_7> , <T_1> you know , <T_0> somebody comes across <T_3> virgin <T_2> , they -- they are quality , richard . <T_9> , <T_8> says <T_4> . <T_6> ?
<T_1> from there <T_4> climb up to <T_0> two , which is <T_2> of the <T_3> .
every <T_2> debate has been sponsored <T_0> &quot; <T_1> coal . &quot;
in fact , if <T_4> just <T_3> that there are five different modes of intervention , the <T_8> that society could intervene in each of those five <T_0> , and we could <T_1> and match them any way we <T_5> , there are 3,000 -- <T_7> than 3,000 -- possible strategies that <T_2> could embrace in <T_9> to nudge kids like <T_6> off of the path that they &apos;re on .
it <T_3> be really <T_0> , <T_1> exception to <T_2> rule .
it <T_1> almost <T_3> years just <T_0> register the <T_2> .
<T_1> we &apos;re <T_2> about perception <T_0> , right ?
and <T_9> &apos;m <T_6> one of the <T_7> competitive environments in <T_5> world , where <T_3> work hard , play <T_8> , <T_4> gotta be <T_1> best , <T_2> gotta be <T_0> best .
<T_5> then <T_1> &apos;s , &quot; am <T_3> a <T_4> that <T_6> should come to <T_2> with <T_0> ? &quot;
as you remember , at some point in the <T_3> for &quot; 2001 , &quot; hal realizes <T_6> the <T_0> is too big , and grand , and profound for <T_5> really <T_4> astronauts . if <T_2> contrast hal &apos;s <T_8> with the triviality of the people <T_7> the spaceship , you <T_9> see what &apos;s written <T_1> the lines .
and there &apos;s <T_0> we <T_3> that is more <T_2> to <T_1> survival .
so <T_3> , i <T_0> there is a chance to re-look at how we <T_1> about <T_2> .
<T_1> finally , <T_0> understand what those <T_2> are .
<T_1> worry about cocaine coming <T_0> the <T_2> ridge <T_3> .
so <T_4> &apos;s pretty <T_0> to find <T_2> chimpanzees , like <T_7> many <T_5> creatures <T_6> the <T_3> , are losing their <T_1> .
<T_4> possible <T_6> of being <T_5> would be a way of life -- <T_8> way <T_3> being , experiencing , <T_0> , <T_7> , <T_2> with the <T_1> .
<T_8> &apos;ve seen that <T_5> has enabled ngos in <T_9> to put up <T_3> to be solved by design students <T_7> the <T_0> , including something that &apos;s being used for tsunami relief right now : it &apos;s <T_2> mechanism for <T_4> cholera victims that &apos;s so <T_6> to use it , illiterates can be <T_1> to use it .
<T_2> don &apos;t <T_3> , <T_1> recharge your <T_0> every time .
so this <T_3> to be <T_2> feature <T_1> ultraviolet rays <T_4> the <T_0> .
<T_2> this <T_0> about a little <T_3> four <T_1> years ago .
<T_3> &apos;m a <T_1> and an <T_5> , <T_4> i put <T_2> to sleep <T_0> a living .
it <T_0> part because it <T_2> constituent buy-in <T_4> it lacked stakeholder <T_3> . <T_1>
<T_4> the <T_1> is harming them , and <T_0> food that &apos;s grown <T_2> the contaminated <T_3> is poisoning them .
now , <T_1> do <T_0> say that ?
there &apos;s no <T_7> time <T_4> you , only <T_1> -- <T_6> collecting of <T_3> with <T_2> hope for <T_0> and at the same time <T_5> .
now <T_1> can also see <T_0> little bit <T_3> we did some of these <T_2> .
so <T_1> started running <T_3> telling everybody the <T_0> were coming , <T_5> out , <T_2> cops were <T_4> .
<T_1> , <T_3> african <T_2> , are sitting at 10 to 30 percent <T_0> gdp .
<T_0> if they <T_5> were intelligent , why would <T_7> use <T_1> stick to <T_3> termites <T_2> the <T_6> rather than a <T_4> ?
<T_2> they follow <T_0> , they &apos;ll pick up the phone <T_3> say , &quot; hey , do you have <T_1> original ? &quot;
<T_2> don &apos;t have a good <T_0> for <T_1> .
but <T_2> me first begin by <T_0> you <T_4> pictures of what <T_3> thing <T_1> like .
profits <T_0> , <T_1> ignored .
then <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> issue <T_3> you &apos;re all <T_0> of .
<T_3> , the <T_4> thing about this is <T_5> i take <T_1> lines <T_7> , <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> if you haven &apos;t <T_8> anything <T_6> the last minute .
<T_3> can go back to his <T_0> : <T_1> &apos;s quite <T_2> .
<T_7> , my message <T_2> you <T_6> , <T_0> my three <T_9> , is <T_3> i appreciate the chance to share this with <T_5> . <T_8> will be back . <T_1> love being <T_4> ted .
what <T_1> comes down to , really , is four <T_0> principles : <T_6> from <T_5> , follow <T_4> one , <T_2> for patterns , and <T_7> like <T_3> .
and he urged <T_7> people <T_8> that meeting , in that <T_4> , <T_2> devote themselves to closing the gap <T_9> those <T_6> ideas , <T_0> work together <T_3> try to make the world as it is and the <T_1> as <T_5> should be , one and the same .
civilizations <T_3> . <T_1> overwhelming <T_5> of all species <T_2> all civilizations <T_4> have ever <T_0> are <T_6> history .
<T_0> : <T_1> what ?
first of all , worse <T_2> , <T_0> shorter <T_1> .
<T_7> of the <T_4> companies , for instance , believe <T_3> they are <T_5> producing a high-quality <T_2> at a <T_0> price , so <T_1> are very <T_6> .
he <T_4> thinking far <T_3> , to how <T_0> would really grow <T_5> a <T_1> kind of <T_2> .
<T_0> i was doing <T_4> work , <T_8> mom <T_5> my <T_9> , they <T_1> looking at it <T_7> they said , &quot; <T_6> do you deal <T_2> negative <T_3> all the time ? &quot;
north americans , such <T_4> myself , you know , <T_0> &apos;re <T_5> sort of <T_6> , gluttonous <T_1> , <T_3> we &apos;re eating all <T_2> of stuff .
so &quot; <T_2> &quot; <T_1> &apos;t a <T_3> that <T_0> should use with simple confidence .
<T_4> once <T_5> a while <T_1> have these <T_3> , and <T_7> realize just how <T_0> life can be <T_6> it &apos;s at <T_2> best .
and then <T_1> students would come <T_2> our sound <T_6> , <T_4> would make their <T_5> rap songs <T_0> their own <T_3> .
how do we <T_0> that <T_1> ?
anyway , <T_1> had <T_2> major <T_0> issue .
&quot; <T_0> believe <T_2> are seeing <T_4> this response <T_6> result of <T_3> and <T_7> a <T_1> of exposures to <T_5> . &quot;
so <T_5> &apos;s one reason <T_3> think <T_1> we might <T_4> declensionists , going <T_0> the <T_2> direction .
<T_1> are symbolically fed <T_7> cared for , and <T_3> family at this time will begin a <T_8> of <T_9> injunctions , which communicates to the <T_2> community <T_4> them that one of <T_6> members is undergoing the transition from <T_5> life into the afterlife <T_0> as puya .
<T_4> . <T_6> &apos;ve <T_2> a <T_5> of people speak at <T_1> conference about the <T_0> of the human <T_3> .
<T_1> were <T_2> in <T_0> circle .
you <T_1> what <T_0> say ?
now <T_0> main <T_4> guy , <T_6> , does <T_7> want <T_3> stones <T_2> update , so <T_5> &apos;s trying to get them <T_1> stop updating .
there &apos;s <T_4> sense of deep <T_3> that goes with <T_5> things , and it <T_0> to <T_6> of birds <T_1> people <T_2> .
<T_0> there i was <T_3> away , and <T_4> , <T_1> on <T_2> rock .
and no one <T_0> their <T_1> .
for now , let <T_3> try to <T_2> you <T_4> the plausibility of <T_5> hypothesis , that <T_6> &apos;s actually <T_1> taking <T_0> .
<T_6> &apos;ll try <T_8> it all <T_3> in <T_7> middle east , and for so <T_5> years <T_2> were living with <T_0> the wrong <T_4> of the <T_1> east .
you <T_2> , it &apos;s funded nasa &apos;s <T_0> up <T_1> now .
we drilled through a hundred meters of floating <T_2> shelf <T_0> through 900 meters of <T_4> and then 1,300 meters <T_3> the sea <T_1> .
<T_3> all these <T_2> , there &apos;s <T_1> ideal form , because <T_5> are thought in <T_4> of <T_0> .
<T_2> : now , this <T_5> was developed by <T_3> two <T_7> : professor <T_1> suslick <T_4> neil rakow , <T_0> the university <T_6> illinois .
<T_2> then people started <T_0> feel <T_3> there &apos;s something <T_1> happening .
<T_7> &apos;s <T_2> next <T_3> ? gosh , when <T_0> was your <T_4> , i could have never done <T_1> . &apos; <T_6> know what <T_5> do . &quot;
well when <T_3> was asked to do this tedtalk , i was really chuckled , because , you see , my father &apos;s name <T_5> ted , and much of my <T_1> , especially <T_7> musical <T_2> , is <T_0> a talk <T_6> i &apos;m still having <T_8> him , or the part of <T_4> that <T_9> continues to be .
<T_0> is made <T_1> of silicon .
nearly <T_3> million people <T_2> affected <T_9> mental illness worldwide . in wealthy nations , just <T_6> receive appropriate care , but in developing countries , close to 90 percent go untreated because psychiatrists are in such short supply . vikram patel outlines a highly <T_7> -- <T_1> of communities <T_4> give mental health interventions <T_8> <T_0> ordinary people to care <T_5> others .
and <T_4> need <T_2> d. <T_1> &apos;s now <T_0> requirement <T_3> children have a certain amount .
hey , <T_0> , black-eyed <T_2> , <T_1> .
<T_1> is a lot <T_0> to disprove .
and <T_3> are non-zero-sum relationships <T_2> maybe <T_0> aren &apos;t <T_1> of .
but <T_1> person <T_0> put it <T_7> together , instead of hiding <T_3> cracks , decided <T_4> emphasize them , <T_5> gold <T_2> to <T_6> it .
<T_3> seems too <T_0> , <T_2> dangerous , for <T_1> company to take on .
remember i <T_4> him before <T_6> this <T_1> -- &quot; <T_2> people <T_0> god &apos;s <T_7> , <T_5> if <T_3> doesn &apos;t make <T_8> . &quot;
<T_3> i &apos;m standing <T_1> with two <T_2> on <T_0> chin .
we <T_1> took the picture by turning the <T_0> off in <T_4> room , <T_5> this <T_2> what <T_3> see .
ourbeginning.com. <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> event . <T_2> it to the <T_3> .
but <T_0> too <T_7> , <T_2> there &apos;s something <T_4> about seeing a political <T_6> , versus <T_5> told or forced <T_1> listen <T_3> one .
<T_3> tells <T_1> that it &apos;s actually been <T_0> , <T_2> pollen .
<T_0> was the winter of 2009 , and <T_4> had been <T_1> for <T_2> a <T_3> .
so he <T_3> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_4> &apos;ve got to get <T_0> on <T_1> table .
let <T_0> explain by giving you this <T_1> .
<T_0> we manipulated <T_1> much <T_2> we gave them .
that gave me <T_1> great <T_2> : focus <T_3> you <T_0> achieve .
well , it &apos;s <T_2> that life introduces <T_1> entirely <T_0> trick .
<T_0> effect on those <T_1> . <T_2> is what &apos;s <T_3> .
i know many will find <T_2> difficult to separate <T_6> fact <T_4> i &apos;m carlos salinas <T_0> gortari &apos;s <T_9> from <T_5> fact that i &apos;m a <T_8> concerned <T_3> the <T_7> &apos;s <T_1> situation .
if <T_2> imagine this to be <T_4> hyper-intelligent <T_3> , we can <T_0> out an individual and ask <T_1> a <T_5> question .
<T_1> so , <T_5> think <T_6> best <T_7> , <T_8> to <T_3> buddhist view , <T_4> that well-being is not <T_2> a mere pleasurable <T_0> .
and <T_1> wanted to <T_6> with <T_4> photograph , <T_8> picture <T_0> made on a <T_9> stormy day <T_2> new zealand when i <T_3> laid on the <T_5> amidst a school of fish <T_7> around me .
we <T_0> into thinking <T_1> always being connected is going to make <T_2> feel less <T_3> .
<T_5> you &apos;re wrong can <T_1> like all of <T_3> and <T_2> lot of <T_0> things , <T_4> ?
people , you can <T_0> do that .
<T_5> you were sitting in oxford , <T_8> , <T_4> to get to <T_1> , <T_7> packets were going <T_2> pakistan <T_0> they <T_6> &apos;t <T_3> back .
<T_7> &apos;s part of <T_2> galaxy , <T_1> it &apos;s shining <T_0> brightly <T_3> the <T_4> of the galaxy <T_6> a <T_5> suns in it .
<T_7> bottom picture is what <T_6> when <T_2> body <T_1> moving <T_5> the animal <T_8> controlling either a <T_3> device <T_4> a computational <T_0> .
to <T_0> that would be <T_1> kyoto <T_2>
but when it comes to the <T_2> of a human , <T_1> can save their <T_0> .
now , you <T_3> imagine <T_0> was the reaction of the <T_1> finance and <T_2> .
the sounds of the <T_0> were <T_1> .
if <T_5> fall <T_4> your left , you &apos;re going to fall 8,000 <T_1> into <T_6> ; <T_2> you fall <T_3> your right , you &apos;re going to fall 12,000 feet <T_0> tibet .
<T_2> photo is of <T_3> semi-finals of the <T_0> aires <T_4> , four <T_1> later .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_0> difficult for me to <T_7> fijian <T_4> , <T_1> is strange , <T_2> actually there &apos;s an enormous <T_3> going on in <T_6> .
and it &apos;s <T_3> more and more difficult to <T_1> the <T_0> who <T_4> not <T_2> you .
the <T_1> estimates <T_0> of <T_3> the americans <T_6> , 17 <T_4> of us <T_5> getting <T_2> .
so , pretty <T_0> .
<T_3> and <T_1> , <T_0> like to say , on sunday , this is where <T_4> go <T_2> church .
now , these <T_1> were <T_2> big <T_0> .
<T_0> things are <T_2> right , and <T_5> &apos;ll <T_1> these <T_4> are probably not <T_3> words .
this distribution <T_1> brand energy gets <T_0> brand <T_3> to the <T_5> , more <T_2> with the <T_4> .
&apos;i <T_1> a mathematician , <T_6> i would like to stand on <T_0> roof . &apos; <T_8> is how ron eglash greeted many <T_5> families <T_4> met <T_3> researching the fractal <T_2> he &apos;d noticed in villages <T_9> the <T_7> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_3> hard . <T_1> so <T_4> &apos;s certainly <T_2> hard road .
<T_4> the chinese never <T_1> , at least in that <T_3> , <T_7> rules for encouraging <T_5> spread of <T_2> ideas -- a <T_0> motive <T_6> could have encouraged the <T_8> .
<T_9> the <T_3> is <T_5> to be simply , basically <T_4> a <T_7> cup . <T_8> can actually <T_0> together <T_1> we get extremely <T_6> transportation and <T_2> out of them .
<T_3> inhabit the <T_0> at all body <T_1> , and , of course , they <T_4> the <T_2> .
if <T_2> went head-tail-head-tail-head , you <T_0> cunningly get <T_5> occurrences of <T_4> pattern <T_1> only <T_3> tosses .
i <T_0> them -- these <T_1> all fluologists and specialists in influenza -- and <T_3> asked <T_2> the <T_4> you &apos;d like to <T_5> them .
so you <T_2> see here on the vertical <T_5> , i <T_1> &apos;t shown it all the way down <T_0> zero , there are <T_3> of other <T_6> , but here <T_7> &apos;m <T_9> showing you the <T_8> , so i &apos;ve narrowed <T_4> scale .
<T_1> it &apos;s what i call <T_0> design driven .
now , it &apos;s often <T_0> that getting closer and closer <T_7> the <T_2> laws by examining <T_8> at low energies , and then higher energies , and then higher energies , <T_6> short distances , and <T_3> distances , and then <T_5> distances , and so on , is like peeling <T_4> <T_1> of an onion . <T_9>
and in fact , <T_2> &apos;s a <T_0> on <T_4> table now <T_3> building <T_1> seven .
and <T_0> the complexity <T_3> poverty really has to look at <T_2> as only <T_1> variable .

<T_4> in <T_5> 2000 <T_1> was the <T_3> to base jump <T_2> eiger <T_0> face in switzerland .
can <T_0> museum house <T_4> and allow <T_1> to <T_2> change agents as <T_3> rethink themselves ?
and those <T_0> who <T_1> me understood <T_2> joke .
and <T_0> consume <T_6> much that again , a <T_5> of 6.5 billion <T_7> 9.5 billion in <T_2> grandchildren &apos;s lifetime will disproportionately <T_4> the <T_3> and <T_1> most vulnerable .
<T_0> the collective <T_2> , <T_1> soul <T_3> the human race .
radio <T_7> study radio waves <T_4> space using sensitive antennas and <T_8> , <T_5> give them precise <T_1> about <T_2> an <T_9> object is <T_0> where it is in <T_3> night <T_6> .
<T_0> thirdly , the question is , <T_1> will <T_2> do to actually how much <T_3> want it ?
<T_2> goal of me as a <T_1> is <T_0> to understand cancer <T_3>
if <T_2> could make new pictures <T_0> the <T_4> , <T_3> would <T_1> draw ?
<T_2> many of <T_0> here <T_3> deeply <T_1> in that .
<T_1> last thing that &apos;s remarkable about <T_7> tarahumara is that all the things that we &apos;re going to be talking about today , all the things that we &apos;re trying to come up with <T_4> all of our <T_8> and <T_2> power to solve -- things <T_9> heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and <T_0> and violence and <T_5> depression -- all this stuff , the tarahumara don &apos;t <T_3> what you &apos;re <T_6> about .
i <T_1> , &quot; well , i met <T_4> guy <T_0> built the thing and <T_2> left me <T_3> card . &quot;
<T_7> you age <T_3> infant age , your <T_0> gets better , and maybe in <T_4> late <T_6> , early twenties , you &apos;re looking for <T_1> mate , and <T_2> vision goes <T_5> that .
<T_4> certainly , neither <T_5> or i were <T_0> , <T_6> we tried <T_7> build <T_2> model . and <T_3> knew , francis <T_1> wilkins .
now , the ones that <T_5> that needle programs aren &apos;t effective -- you think <T_9> &apos;s <T_1> of these <T_7> dynamic <T_3> and i &apos;m going to press my dongle <T_2> the <T_4> of it &apos;s going to come up , <T_0> no -- <T_6> &apos;s the whole <T_8> .
it <T_4> just enough <T_9> to , <T_8> instance , <T_0> this , which at <T_6> is enough <T_2> , in <T_1> rest of the <T_3> , as mr. holly -- dr. holly -- <T_5> out , can run computers and a light <T_7> .
<T_1> &apos;re called the <T_0> cloud .
<T_2> &apos;s actually my <T_1> , <T_0> here .
<T_1> made <T_2> front page <T_0> my hometown paper <T_4> i <T_5> for <T_3> years , you know ?
so <T_0> we have <T_2> , it &apos;s <T_1> an omnivore &apos;s dilemma .
<T_2> i think they &apos;re doing <T_0> important <T_1> .
<T_1> tzemach <T_0> : <T_2> , example not exception
let &apos;s look at <T_0> now .
for example , right <T_6> we <T_0> put their <T_1> signature whistles <T_5> the computer <T_4> request to <T_2> with a specific <T_3> .
the <T_1> is called the miracle <T_0> science .
<T_2> two mirrors , the scanner calculates the beam &apos;s <T_3> and vertical <T_6> , <T_4> accurate <T_5> , <T_1> , and <T_0> .
we &apos;re <T_1> done with anatomy . we know a tremendous amount about genomics , proteomics and cell biology , <T_0> as diane kelly makes <T_7> at <T_5> , <T_6> are basic <T_2> about the human body <T_8> &apos;re <T_3> learning . <T_4> in point : how does the mammalian erection <T_9> ?
there <T_0> also lots of <T_4> in africa <T_1> new cities <T_3> be <T_2> .
<T_1> will <T_0> system into other areas , <T_2> dialysis treatment .
so from studying <T_1> genomes of extinct humans , we &apos;re beginning to arrive <T_2> a <T_5> of what <T_4> world <T_3> like when <T_6> humans started coming out of <T_0> .
<T_1> that <T_0> there , if you <T_3> carefully , has an antenna <T_2>
to the <T_1> son , <T_4> left a <T_2> of the <T_6> , and to <T_5> youngest son , <T_3> left a <T_0> of the <T_7> .
<T_1> &apos;t have a <T_2> , but had <T_0> .
<T_4> am <T_2> to <T_1> you that <T_0> is in the <T_3> .
and finally <T_4> says , &quot; <T_7> , <T_0> i &apos;m going <T_2> -- &quot; <T_6> of the aura get <T_1> with an <T_3> placed <T_5> pulse .
as it <T_1> out , there is <T_0> strong <T_4> between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a <T_3> time later , consistent with <T_5> idea <T_2> mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy .
<T_0> -- <T_1> .
they all showed <T_3> strange sort of skating <T_4> that <T_0> adopted <T_1> the <T_5> started <T_2> move .
<T_1> find <T_0> comforting .
but <T_1> got this other <T_3> , and <T_5> was the ability of <T_2> perimeter <T_0> suddenly engage <T_6> on the <T_4> .
and <T_1> it is <T_0> africa -- <T_2> &apos;s a lot of <T_3> .
now , hopefully , those <T_4> you who know <T_6> about graph <T_3> can look at that , and that will <T_7> you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure , and in fact , you know , i can now take a <T_5> , carve it up <T_8> then reassemble it so <T_1> &apos;s a linear string that will fold <T_2> a sequence . and now <T_9> can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of <T_0> .
and the <T_3> response <T_0> from recognizing <T_2> islam <T_4> democracy are <T_1> .
<T_2> are less <T_3> to it . <T_0> let other <T_1> worry <T_4> it .
remember <T_0> took <T_1> book , tore <T_2> pages out ?
<T_1> man <T_2> after working <T_0> 36-hour shift .
<T_2> they <T_1> &apos;t give me <T_0> answer .
<T_3> like <T_6> , <T_5> positive <T_2> and <T_4> potential for good for <T_1> study <T_7> that far outweighs <T_0> risk .
<T_1> abilities , of course , decrease with <T_0> .
and <T_3> &apos;ll show you a <T_2> of projects that came out of <T_1> seven <T_4> following <T_0> sabbatical .
<T_0> also , the sense of <T_1> .
<T_2> have to change <T_3> minds of <T_7> american people . because <T_6> the politicians do <T_0> have permission to <T_1> what <T_4> to be <T_5> .
<T_0> this table , you can actually see what is an <T_2> of a successful <T_3> control by <T_1> bugs .
shortly <T_1> , <T_4> went to <T_0> women &apos;s college <T_2> boston , then <T_3> .
so in many cases this <T_0> not so much <T_7> making change as <T_4> is creating the <T_2> under <T_1> change is possible and the incentive <T_5> want to make change , which is easier <T_9> than <T_6> in rural <T_8> and <T_3> inside-the-box education systems in rural communities .
let <T_0> point <T_1> out .
so i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you that there &apos;s <T_7> lot of great , <T_8> things to be learned about <T_6> nature makes materials -- <T_4> taking it <T_0> next <T_1> to <T_3> if you can force , or whether you can <T_9> advantage of how nature makes materials , to make things <T_2> nature hasn &apos;t yet <T_5> of making .
<T_1> that &apos;s how this was <T_0> . it &apos;s actually slice , <T_2> .
<T_5> : we &apos;re actually , we &apos;ve been making some good progress <T_1> with <T_0> we call the grasshopper test project , where <T_2> &apos;re <T_3> the <T_8> landing portion <T_9> the flight , the sort of <T_4> portion which <T_6> quite <T_7> .
<T_5> toroidal geometry <T_0> for a very <T_3> building : every <T_2> in this building <T_6> the same <T_1> , all laminated <T_4> .
more of <T_0> economics <T_1> global in <T_2> .
it has expanded more , though , than just keeping us away <T_6> physical <T_0> , <T_3> there &apos;s a growing <T_1> of evidence to <T_5> that , in fact , this emotion of <T_7> now influences <T_8> moral <T_2> and <T_9> our deeply held political <T_4> .
then <T_1> typical <T_0> responds , &quot; <T_2> that <T_3> . &quot;
<T_6> was <T_9> in <T_4> idea of why and how <T_2> could create a <T_3> story , <T_1> new <T_0> in art history <T_8> a <T_7> narrative in <T_5> world .
<T_1> was <T_2> month of <T_0> life .
<T_2> want to <T_1> this up here and come <T_0> to it .
sobule : <T_1> sing . <T_8> : i <T_2> stories . <T_5> : <T_9> jill and julia show . sobule : sometimes <T_3> works . <T_0> : <T_7> it doesn &apos;t . <T_4> : <T_6> jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show .
<T_2> anyway , <T_0> year <T_4> &apos;ve taken the <T_1> company <T_3> a ski trip .
you &apos;re <T_3> . <T_2> wake up , <T_4> without <T_1> your head from <T_7> earth on your <T_0> bag , you can <T_6> for <T_5> miles .
<T_1> needed to be a <T_0> sympathetic <T_2> .
now , <T_8> was <T_9> about this , because <T_3> school , <T_2> was a <T_1> named kevin , and he was <T_6> on me because i <T_5> the <T_0> jewish <T_4> in <T_7> .
scraps of men do not <T_0> .
so we were <T_0> something , and <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> onto something .
<T_2> &apos;m <T_1> on top of the <T_0> .
and <T_2> &apos;s a really <T_1> thing about <T_0> approach .
<T_3> it <T_1> &apos;t just <T_4> growing , <T_0> we all are <T_5> of this <T_2> .
<T_0> you <T_1> that ?
so <T_1> is <T_2> piece that demands <T_0> .
but <T_1> us <T_0> was just dad , and our home life <T_2> pretty <T_3> .
<T_0> is <T_1> , which is <T_2> largest slum <T_3> east africa .
<T_2> that &apos;s a <T_1> which will take <T_3> your <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;t it be <T_2> if <T_3> all had <T_1> on our <T_4> ?
<T_3> wish <T_0> that we design <T_1> future <T_2> learning .
so , <T_2> open <T_6> window , and i <T_1> out , <T_7> there &apos;s <T_4> coming up <T_0> side of <T_3> hotel , and the <T_5> &apos;s on fire .
it <T_1> to the nucleus <T_0> , all <T_2> way up <T_4> the prefrontal cortex , orbital frontal cortex , <T_5> decisions <T_3> made , high level .
<T_1> &apos;ve made <T_2> a <T_0> i-don &apos;t-know-it-all .
the <T_6> with the <T_7> continent <T_5> the <T_3> with the <T_2> industry is <T_1> it has distorted the structure of incentives facing <T_0> governments <T_4> africa .
i co-founded a <T_4> called navigenics , where , if you spit <T_3> a tube -- and we can look look at <T_2> or 40 genetic markers <T_9> disease , all of which are delayable <T_5> many of the <T_7> -- you start to identify <T_0> you <T_8> get , and then we <T_1> start to work <T_6> prevent them .
hong <T_2> i refer to <T_6> a <T_0> of analog <T_3> in a <T_4> age , <T_1> you <T_5> have a point of <T_7> .
<T_4> they know who <T_3> were voting <T_1> and <T_0> the impact <T_2> ?
one in four <T_0> suffer from <T_3> sort of mental <T_2> , so <T_4> it <T_1> one , <T_5> , <T_7> , <T_8> , it &apos;s you , <T_6> .
<T_0> you .
now , <T_6> was <T_3> little <T_7> because <T_5> you see those <T_2> problems , <T_4> seem really <T_1> to deal <T_0> .
and <T_1> process needed to make it is <T_0> coming toward the market quite nicely .
i got a <T_6> curious . in fact i &apos;ll stop here <T_9> <T_0> i want <T_2> ask , and there is <T_7> <T_4> of people who <T_8> <T_5> india of <T_3> , <T_1> who grew up spending your childhood here .
and <T_6> &apos;ve never met <T_5> . <T_3> &apos;ve only communicated <T_7> this telepresence system , which <T_0> makes <T_4> think of him as <T_8> man <T_1> the <T_2> .
<T_9> can <T_4> of insulin <T_0> this <T_6> hormone <T_7> controls <T_8> our <T_2> does with the <T_3> we <T_5> , whether we <T_1> it or store it .
<T_4> know a <T_8> , married <T_1> 25 years , who &apos;s <T_7> to hear <T_2> wife say , &quot; <T_0> you for being <T_9> breadwinner , so <T_5> can <T_3> home with the <T_6> , &quot; but won &apos;t ask .
<T_9> isn &apos;t <T_6> now of a shooting <T_5> in <T_2> foot or <T_0> second that <T_4> bite into a pastry <T_7> the <T_3> hours that you lose yourself in <T_8> great <T_1> .

and <T_3> there was the <T_9> , <T_7> rhythmic <T_1> of it , <T_5> me of <T_0> spent <T_8> to bedouin elders recite hours-long <T_6> poems <T_4> from <T_2> .

and it <T_7> here , listening <T_5> these <T_4> share <T_2> stories , that i <T_1> that spoken word poetry didn &apos;t <T_0> to be indignant , <T_6> could be <T_3> or <T_9> or serious <T_8> silly .
and <T_4> is <T_2> , and <T_3> could <T_1> more useful <T_5> feeling <T_0> and fun ?

<T_6> you run <T_3> short <T_7> , like <T_9> tuning fork <T_5> antenna resonates , and there &apos;s more <T_1> coming out of the antenna than <T_4> is the backscatter <T_2> the ground that we &apos;re trying to <T_8> , <T_0> too much processing . &quot;

so <T_0> have <T_8> picture , which is quite a spectacular <T_4> , <T_1> i &apos;ll <T_7> back <T_3> the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysterious <T_5> that <T_6> the <T_2> off <T_9> the beginning .

<T_2> really is <T_1> a new <T_0> .
<T_0> i think there &apos;s <T_3> very good <T_4> there &apos;s about <T_2> or 40 <T_1> in <T_5> room .
<T_0> was <T_4> years old <T_1> year <T_3> i <T_5> her , and <T_6> aspired to be a professional <T_2> .
<T_2> is something <T_1> folds <T_4> of <T_3> into completely <T_0> worlds .
<T_1> is wrong <T_2> the <T_3> that <T_0> have chosen ?
<T_0> am <T_1> .
so let &apos;s say , <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;re <T_4> a <T_1> , rural <T_3> .
and <T_2> are those <T_0> who have incredible <T_1> abilities .
<T_1> invited <T_5> artists , <T_6> , and <T_7> to write <T_4> about this , <T_0> the results , the results <T_3> collected in <T_2> book from <T_8> press .
<T_3> cognitively , now -- just <T_1> a cognitive <T_0> of view -- <T_4> was <T_2> winner ?
what <T_0> scientists <T_1> before ?
<T_0> , <T_3> know , when we pulled up <T_5> a <T_6> the <T_1> in <T_7> adjacent <T_2> kind of gave us respectful <T_4> .
we <T_4> do a <T_6> more <T_5> computers <T_2> things generally <T_3> we <T_1> how to build <T_0> this way .
and <T_0> allows the <T_1> to turn into a <T_2> .
<T_1> can <T_0> the five-year-old <T_2> working .
so <T_0> started .
the region , <T_8> u.k. and <T_1> u.s. decide , has <T_2> be kept safe <T_0> communism , <T_7> the <T_4> that will be created <T_6> do this would be <T_3> , <T_5> shah .
samuel <T_1> , <T_5> twain , was <T_3> big investor <T_2> the most <T_4> machine of <T_6> times -- at <T_8> until <T_0> -- <T_7> with the u.s. patent office .
you <T_0> &apos;t get <T_1> of waste .
they &apos;d slice <T_0> up in <T_2> slices <T_3> make me swallow <T_1> coals .
and <T_0> can <T_1> really precisely .
but <T_5> decided that <T_4> chicken <T_3> look like <T_2> heart , a <T_1> , <T_0> star ?
and that <T_9> and <T_3> that amount of light <T_5> important <T_8> it &apos;s a little like you or i sitting around a campfire : you want to be <T_7> enough to the <T_2> so <T_6> you &apos;re warm , but <T_1> so close <T_0> you &apos;re too toasty and you get <T_4> .
<T_2> electric <T_1> , also very <T_0> .
<T_1> : in <T_0> ?
and <T_3> is <T_2> i will keep <T_1> my heart <T_0> .
ts : <T_2> is the <T_0> actually , <T_1> it <T_3> .
<T_4> like a billion <T_3> depend on fish , <T_2> quantity <T_1> fish in <T_0> oceans .
we <T_4> take a <T_1> of what &apos;s going on , but <T_2> if we single <T_3> this <T_5> , it &apos;s tricky to <T_0> what &apos;s going on .
<T_0> is <T_1> internet search engine .
and you <T_6> didn &apos;t realize it &apos;s going to do all these <T_4> -- <T_3> full <T_5> solenoids , and <T_1> , and computers <T_0> all this kind of stuff . the highest <T_2> out of japan <T_7>
what <T_0> happened in <T_2> last 15 <T_1> with this <T_3> ?
now , the online <T_2> to make the <T_1> as <T_5> and as <T_0> as <T_6> street , <T_4> &apos;re <T_3> there .
<T_1> was about <T_0> .
now , look , a <T_4> has been written <T_0> the deplorable <T_2> of <T_1> literacy in <T_3> country .
and , of course , graphics : <T_5> 84 dollars and 97 cents at best buy buys <T_3> more graphics power <T_4> you could have gotten <T_2> a <T_1> bucks from sgi <T_0> a decade <T_6> .
so <T_3> word <T_0> its source <T_1> like a <T_2> flower .
but some <T_1> bought a coffee <T_6> themselves , <T_3> way <T_4> usually would , but other <T_2> said that <T_7> bought <T_5> coffee <T_0> somebody <T_8> .
<T_8> this gives <T_1> to <T_9> provider , <T_3> there &apos;s <T_4> or <T_6> , because they <T_7> adjust the flow based on <T_2> percentage of <T_5> they see that they &apos;re giving their <T_0> .
<T_2> the 20th <T_6> , the <T_4> of <T_1> credit transformed <T_5> consumer system , and <T_0> many <T_7> controlled who had access to <T_3> .
<T_2> couldn &apos;t believe <T_7> it <T_6> do this . it <T_0> to us <T_5> if you could build <T_4> robot with very simple , springy <T_3> , you could make it <T_9> maneuverable <T_8> any <T_1> &apos;s ever been built .
one <T_1> the things that i <T_0> to summarize <T_5> you then is what is a <T_2> that <T_4> &apos;re going for in <T_3> medicine .
<T_2> phi <T_0> hill resort , i was <T_1> into the <T_7> furthest away <T_6> the television , but <T_5> strained to <T_4> for information <T_3>
<T_2> basically <T_4> ask the <T_1> : what <T_0> art was <T_5> that we <T_3> looking at it ?
<T_0> , <T_2> i know -- -- <T_4> , i assume <T_1> answers my <T_3> .
so , recently , we have realized that <T_0> ordinary matter <T_9> the universe -- and by <T_2> matter , <T_8> mean you , me , <T_3> planets , the stars , the galaxies -- the <T_1> matter <T_7> up only <T_6> few percent <T_4> the content of the <T_5> .
these <T_0> turbines <T_2> rotate <T_1> incredibly <T_3> windspeeds , as a result .
<T_3> what was also <T_6> of the bigger <T_5> around that was moving <T_7> full-size cities up <T_2> of the <T_8> , <T_4> flattening all the <T_0> so they could make way for <T_1> ships .
there <T_0> a <T_9> between mediocre work <T_5> good <T_8> , <T_7> as anybody who &apos;s worked as an <T_2> or a <T_1> knows , it &apos;s a spectrum <T_3> &apos;re constantly <T_6> to get on <T_4> of .
the question is <T_7> do <T_1> reconnect american national <T_3> with global <T_5> to make the world a <T_4> more comfortable , and to <T_8> and contextualize <T_0> employment of <T_2> around the <T_6> ?
there &apos;s <T_0> aversion to <T_3> , which <T_4> <T_1> percent of <T_2> students .
so here <T_0> what we <T_3> . <T_1> put <T_4> 10-cent digital <T_5> , <T_6> data tag , in <T_2> appliance plug .
how <T_1> you make <T_2> poems <T_3> beautiful so <T_0> ? &quot;
<T_2> is one <T_0> africa &apos;s <T_1> slums .

they don &apos;t <T_1> those <T_0> .
and <T_2> is a <T_0> in japan <T_1> a <T_3> monk .

and in <T_9> , every <T_8> one of the <T_7> world traditions has <T_6> -- <T_2> said -- <T_1> put at the <T_5> of their <T_3> what &apos;s become known as <T_0> golden <T_4> .
<T_6> loren <T_4> right in <T_1> of me -- <T_3> &apos;s a <T_5> taller <T_2> i am , not <T_0> the poofy hair .
and <T_0> front in the <T_3> is not <T_2> , it &apos;s <T_1> an <T_4> .
<T_3> sometime <T_5> feel like stopping and <T_2> doing it , <T_1> i didn &apos;t know <T_0> i was putting <T_4> into .
if you <T_6> to boil <T_3> and re-condense it <T_0> a rate <T_5> 10 <T_2> an <T_4> , it <T_7> about 25 , a <T_1> over 25.3 <T_9> -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do <T_8> .
what <T_4> &apos;ll <T_8> , i <T_1> , <T_3> two <T_6> that <T_0> critical , and these , <T_5> think , are <T_7> challenges for <T_2> open movement .
at the <T_1> end of <T_5> scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all a &apos;s , and you also find <T_3> computer program , in this case in the <T_2> fortran , which obeys <T_4> strict <T_0> .
<T_3> second assumption which <T_2> the american <T_1> of <T_0> goes <T_4> like this .

and i <T_1> i <T_2> totally <T_0> this whole thing .
so <T_0> we need to do <T_4> is put <T_1> two pictures together <T_3> our <T_2> -- <T_5> like this .
<T_1> then , <T_3> could tell you lots <T_4> the laptop , <T_5> i <T_2> on just <T_0> things .
<T_5> was that <T_2> nobel <T_3> was the <T_1> on all great <T_7> , and <T_4> resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 <T_6> that <T_9> &apos;d entered over 11 years , and <T_8> made <T_0> bananas .

<T_9> has been a lot of competition <T_2> the <T_3> , and <T_1> need to develop <T_7> new <T_4> of partnership , truly <T_6> , <T_5> we are looking for <T_8> , <T_0> substituting .
<T_7> think those are deforming <T_0> , and <T_2> of all , <T_1> seems to <T_6> things like <T_5> or <T_3> or compromise <T_4> collaboration .
i <T_3> . i <T_0> . <T_2> listened to <T_1> chest .

<T_1> let &apos;s go back to <T_0> higgs field .
<T_7> have <T_5> simple little <T_1> systems you see here , very simple <T_2> . <T_0> instance , i could open <T_3> of my <T_4> here <T_6> then carve out rivers .
<T_1> what &apos;s even more <T_0> is what &apos;s happening with <T_2> boys .
but <T_1> centerpiece species <T_3> zakouma <T_0> the <T_2> .
and they adopted <T_3> very interesting <T_2> to <T_7> , <T_0> was they <T_5> going to take me <T_1> a school <T_4> they can <T_6> afford .
<T_2> only that , <T_3> &apos;s left-handed . <T_1> you <T_0> this ?
and by <T_0> , he &apos;s a psychophysicist .
why do we <T_0> to <T_1> that ?
for <T_3> , like <T_0> of other people <T_4> the <T_2> today , <T_5> is an <T_1> language .
we <T_2> for a <T_1> minutes and then <T_3> of us <T_4> back into <T_0> chaos .
<T_2> let <T_3> bring you to <T_0> very different <T_1> .
and <T_2> team just <T_0> it to me <T_1> .

so they <T_0> him in .
<T_2> the <T_5> , stephen <T_4> told us <T_8> a <T_1> hole , even though <T_6> think <T_9> &apos;s <T_3> , it actually <T_7> radiation when <T_0> take into account quantum mechanics .
<T_4> means consist of <T_7> something a little technical , st segment elevation of the electrogram -- translated <T_0> english , <T_2> means that if there &apos;s an <T_9> signal <T_5> the heart , and <T_1> part of the ecg -- which we call the st segment -- elevates , that is <T_3> sure <T_8> of <T_6> heart attack .
<T_0> would be helping <T_3> reformers <T_4> these <T_2> , who are <T_1> for change .
after two <T_2> , three <T_0> , <T_3> weeks , <T_1> weeks .
<T_0> we certainly <T_2> what happens <T_1> our <T_3> .
what <T_0> the <T_1> point ?
<T_5> i &apos;m not <T_3> naive , because a <T_8> of the time i &apos;ve been asked , many <T_9> i &apos;ve been asked , &quot; <T_4> , but , this is really <T_2> , sending flowers over , i mean — &quot; i was <T_7> the <T_6> . i was in <T_1> paratroopers for three years , and i know how it <T_0> from the ground .

right now , as bill <T_3> has <T_1> out , <T_6> objects <T_4> we <T_5> and <T_0> have <T_2> consequences .
and <T_3> lots and lots of <T_6> obviously , i &apos;m delighted <T_7> this <T_5> , ahmad <T_0> , <T_8> of my <T_2> and <T_1> really , he <T_4> to get <T_9> involved .
<T_1> work is <T_0> years <T_2> .
but <T_1> in <T_2> seemed to <T_0> the case .

<T_7> i became <T_8> more and more agitated , because <T_0> was <T_9> not only to be <T_3> them , but <T_5> to ride <T_1> create a <T_2> and <T_4> didn &apos;t know <T_6> to do .
so maybe <T_1> chemical <T_0> that would be <T_2> .
and the <T_1> between the <T_4> generates <T_2> heat <T_3> keep it at <T_0> .
and <T_3> , the <T_6> process , <T_1> you develop a <T_2> , put it <T_7> mice , into men , are <T_0> yielding those results -- <T_4> billions of <T_5> that have <T_8> spent .

in <T_7> , <T_6> was so <T_2> that for years thereafter , people just kept talking <T_5> all the <T_1> things that <T_9> , <T_0> &apos; <T_8> , &apos; <T_4> , &apos; <T_3> .
and <T_3> think <T_1> we really see <T_2> other , we want <T_0> help <T_4> other .
the <T_2> of this <T_0> is &quot; the <T_3> to <T_1> . &quot;
and <T_0> , they demoralize <T_2> activity <T_1> .
<T_5> , the <T_0> in <T_4> they work <T_1> terrible <T_2> -- <T_3> roads to speak of , sporadic <T_7> and <T_6> levels of corruption .
<T_1> wash the <T_0> out .
<T_2> part of the <T_1> is called the anterior <T_0> gyrus .
<T_6> almost <T_2> , <T_5> all the <T_3> , they were really <T_4> damaged <T_1> having been made fun of , ridiculed , picked on and been <T_0> .
i &apos;ve been <T_7> with crop <T_1> for about <T_3> years from now , ever since <T_4> stumbled across <T_2> fairly <T_6> academic <T_8> by <T_5> guy named <T_0> harlan .
<T_6> the <T_1> had to be waves in some material medium : the ether <T_7> <T_0> we find real matter <T_4> only because <T_3> &apos;ve evolved <T_2> survive in <T_9> world , where <T_8> is a <T_5> fiction .
<T_3> ? we <T_0> would have found those <T_4> our <T_2> with <T_1> &apos;s <T_5> now .
this <T_1> just before <T_2> got kicked out by the parks services , for <T_0> with the <T_3> there .

<T_1> the <T_3> about hypertext is <T_7> everything in hypertext is either <T_2> , <T_6> here <T_4> connected to <T_0> ; it &apos;s <T_5> non-spatial .
<T_1> i <T_2> it <T_4> be about <T_3> million or <T_0> 500 million .
so that &apos;s a wish <T_4> &apos;m <T_5> out here for everybody , <T_3> i <T_0> i can really engage <T_2> in <T_1> idea .
<T_1> its <T_0> .

so <T_5> we found the <T_0> , <T_6> doesn &apos;t seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other , <T_4> believed that , if <T_3> were smart enough and strong <T_7> and <T_9> enough , <T_1> we worked hard <T_8> , we could keep <T_2> from dying ever .
<T_4> there &apos;ve been bangs in <T_0> past , <T_3> there <T_2> be bangs in <T_1> future .
that <T_1> we &apos;d go <T_0> 44,000 <T_2> 180,000 .
the <T_0> big <T_2> , <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s the <T_1> ; <T_2> &apos;s keeping you <T_0> right now .
<T_4> they really help molecules , <T_8> nucleic acids , like <T_6> and <T_0> , <T_9> inside , <T_1> , <T_2> , divide and do <T_5> of the processes <T_3> we call <T_7> .
<T_5> after <T_8> visit , i <T_2> introduced to a <T_0> physicist at <T_7> who was a <T_4> in cardiac <T_6> , something <T_3> had nothing <T_1> do with .
it <T_4> tell <T_0> that <T_1> route <T_5> missing <T_3> or <T_2> paths , though .
<T_2> : please , please <T_1> seated . stay seated . <T_0> you .
<T_4> can <T_5> take a risky <T_6> -- <T_1> i &apos;ll flip <T_3> coin . if it comes up <T_0> , you &apos;re going to actually lose a <T_2> .
what are <T_2> that you get <T_1> the <T_3> that you <T_4> &apos;t <T_0> explain ?
<T_1> look <T_0> , and <T_5> go , &quot; <T_2> god , look at <T_4> these <T_3> people !
so <T_3> was <T_0> and <T_1> . now <T_2> about evolution ?
<T_1> are all <T_0> little ones ? &quot;
and <T_3> skeletons have a <T_2> set of behaviors , <T_4> i &apos;m going to demonstrate <T_1> a <T_0> .
<T_0> said they wouldn &apos;t let <T_1> play .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> going to work ; <T_5> &apos;re <T_2> going to stop <T_0> fighting <T_3> afghanistan ; the <T_7> won &apos;t <T_6> , etc . , etc .
<T_2> was like , &quot; <T_5> are not <T_4> , because <T_1> took <T_3> gamble on <T_0> , and <T_6> &apos;re staying .
now this <T_6> makes possible <T_9> like combing through all available data <T_0> very different <T_5> , <T_7> key relationships <T_4> putting them in one <T_2> , <T_3> that &apos;s been nearly <T_8> to do <T_1> .
this proprietary <T_7> of vendor lock-in <T_3> go on <T_6> be perfected <T_0> great <T_2> as one of <T_1> enduring <T_5> of <T_4> systems everywhere .
<T_1> nazis <T_0> the netherlands .
and <T_3> called <T_4> up and <T_6> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_5> ran <T_1> race and <T_0> won ... &quot;
you see , unlike <T_3> woman <T_0> night <T_2> , <T_1> woman had type 2 diabetes .
so , you <T_0> to <T_1> that past .
<T_5> , peter <T_4> a whole <T_0> about this and <T_6> <T_2> , he did some <T_1> tests that <T_3> published .
i <T_8> &apos;t know <T_4> it <T_7> , <T_3> didn &apos;t know <T_1> they <T_6> , and <T_2> could tell they were <T_5> trying to get <T_0> out .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_8> mythology <T_3> india <T_7> -- where <T_0> say , and i &apos;ll <T_1> it <T_2> hindi , &#91; <T_6> &#93; right . what does <T_5> mean ?
<T_0> yet , <T_1> of <T_2> get built .
<T_1> then <T_0> would launch in .
there &apos;s a <T_0> disjunction between <T_4> patient &apos;s perception <T_1> our own perceptions <T_5> physicians <T_3> the <T_2> medical <T_6> .
<T_4> medical <T_6> stopped seeking <T_0> and concentrated <T_3> prevention <T_5> , then it <T_1> achieve <T_7> little of <T_2> .
now , large herds dung <T_0> urinate all <T_8> their own food , and <T_7> have to keep moving , and <T_6> was <T_1> movement that <T_4> the <T_5> of plants , while the periodic <T_9> ensured good cover of the <T_2> , as <T_3> see where a herd has passed .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> he <T_0> .
in so far as <T_3> was <T_4> them , he <T_6> doing so <T_7> , which <T_5> thought <T_0> mean that there was <T_2> tumor of some kind in <T_1> .
easy <T_0> treat . look <T_1> the <T_2> in <T_3> .
<T_2> we can <T_1> fact see where <T_0> data is going to .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the <T_8> sutra , <T_5> ancient work <T_7> ancient <T_6> in which the <T_2> appears at the beginning and a whole <T_0> of people come to <T_1> him from the <T_9> city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some <T_3> of jeweled parasols to make an offering to <T_4> .
and <T_0> i <T_4> get the <T_5> -- <T_2> , <T_7> -- you &apos;ll <T_6> , as <T_1> get sort of <T_3> ...
now , when i talk about this <T_3> my friends <T_6> cambridge <T_4> silicon <T_2> , <T_5> say , &quot; <T_7> . no more <T_0> , no more <T_1> .
&quot; <T_4> &apos;ve never really been <T_5> of this , <T_0> i <T_2> assure you <T_3> this quirk <T_7> &apos;re <T_6> self-conscious of is <T_1> endearing .
<T_0> you &apos;re watching <T_3> now , <T_2> hope <T_4> can <T_1> me .
clearly , <T_1> internet <T_5> already having eyes <T_2> ears , <T_0> have <T_7> cams <T_4> so <T_3> . but it &apos;s <T_6> to also have legs <T_8> hands .
<T_0> makes <T_2> to want to <T_1> to continue this research and research and research .
thank you .
and after that , the males <T_1> die . <T_0> &apos;s it for <T_2> .
<T_0> i was <T_3> that &apos;s what <T_2> life <T_1> be .
<T_4> burroughs <T_6> a memoir <T_3> &#91; &quot; <T_5> &quot; &#93; , <T_0> it &apos;s <T_1> his <T_2> in rehab .
<T_0> produced an election forum booklet <T_4> the <T_5> town to <T_2> more <T_1> their <T_3> .
for <T_0> end , <T_4> the eternity , it <T_3> one <T_2> a <T_1> jacket . &quot;
and <T_4> cognitive surplus , we &apos;re starting to <T_2> truly <T_0> experiments in <T_6> , <T_5> , <T_1> , political <T_3> .
and <T_0> think you &apos;ll have <T_2> better <T_1> more empowered <T_3> .
now , <T_3> you <T_0> global you <T_2> to talk <T_1> .
it needs to <T_4> on par <T_2> better <T_1> the best products <T_0> the <T_3> .
there <T_1> three <T_2> . the <T_3> way is -- it &apos;s called <T_0> .
and <T_5> are quite structural , <T_2> social impact <T_9> where you raise money to invest in diverting <T_8> from crime <T_1> helping old <T_3> keep out of <T_7> , and you get paid back according <T_0> how <T_6> your projects <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s funny how <T_1> thoughts <T_2> of waft into your <T_3> .
<T_1> ate <T_0> .
and i remember <T_1> the discussion on <T_2> and thinking how <T_3> it was <T_4> the separation of <T_0> and <T_9> was essentially <T_5> geographical boundaries <T_8> this country , between <T_6> where people believed in it and places where <T_7> didn &apos;t .
okay ? and <T_4> are my <T_2> farmers of <T_7> , growing up <T_0> brook park <T_5> 141st <T_1> , <T_3> most <T_6> community in america .
and <T_0> tested them .
<T_0> svalbard global seed <T_5> is a <T_3> gift <T_6> norway and <T_2> have given us , but <T_1> &apos;s <T_7> the <T_4> answer .
and <T_0> felt <T_1> tears streaming <T_3> my <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
the <T_0> with this is <T_3> essentially what you <T_4> up getting after a while is the <T_2> of the <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;t leave <T_1> situation <T_2> like , <T_5> , i didn &apos;t show them <T_0> i <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> bieber &apos;s &quot; <T_1> . &quot;
so <T_2> there &apos;s a <T_0> room full of <T_1> .
<T_2> , we <T_0> said <T_1> surgeons .
<T_1> , i see <T_3> , scribble everything <T_2> , draw things , <T_5> i <T_0> to <T_4> .
and <T_1> learned that <T_0> stuff <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s also designed <T_2> the <T_0> that <T_1> will be used in .
we <T_0> this <T_1> year .
there <T_2> an <T_3> which was run <T_1> ap , on the <T_0> .
i <T_0> that <T_1> ; <T_3> &apos;ve done it <T_2> million times .
he <T_3> not a <T_1> , <T_2> he <T_0> lost .
all of us , i <T_4> , <T_5> more <T_7> , and <T_0> reason <T_6> , <T_2> believe <T_1> is better than <T_3> .
so if <T_2> tell me i <T_3> do the <T_0> , i &apos;ll <T_1> laugh at you .
how did you <T_4> up in <T_0> ? <T_3> was <T_1> a <T_2> weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
and much <T_0> my surprise , they <T_1> noticed .
and <T_5> begins first by one <T_8> and <T_4> that all <T_6> are with <T_1> -- even <T_2> too , but <T_3> is <T_7> human <T_0> .
once <T_0> the pile , one of <T_2> boys lowered <T_4> shorts , <T_3> , <T_1> defecated .
they <T_0> at you .
<T_1> should be the <T_0> .
so they <T_0> cluster together .
<T_5> , <T_3> i <T_0> it by <T_6> sixth of a turn , <T_4> still it <T_2> like it did <T_1> i started .
we <T_0> women , <T_1> .
and <T_3> is an <T_4> of a very , <T_5> , <T_0> cluster , <T_1> coma <T_2> .
<T_2> i <T_4> i was going <T_0> come to <T_6> to you , <T_1> thought , &quot; <T_5> gotta call my <T_3> . &quot;
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> why the tutor <T_0> grew so <T_3> .
it should be <T_0> enough to arouse <T_3> , <T_1> long enough <T_2> the subject <T_4>
<T_5> there is <T_0> kind of heroic <T_6> , a kind of plain-spoken <T_4> to those who <T_3> their <T_1> at <T_2> a.m .
and so <T_2> feel so blessed <T_4> everything <T_0> i <T_7> , that two <T_1> a <T_3> i go <T_5> i counsel hiv <T_6> .
i <T_3> thrilled <T_5> get it . <T_7> was <T_4> to <T_8> the <T_6> person standing on <T_2> stage with <T_1> shiny silver <T_0> .
one other <T_7> you can do <T_6> such a thing is you <T_0> , because <T_8> &apos;s <T_1> pattern matching exercise , <T_3> there &apos;s unique fingerprint , we <T_4> actually scan through the entire <T_9> and find <T_5> proteins that <T_2> a similar fingerprint .
on <T_6> in <T_5> mosque , he gave sermons trying to reclaim the <T_0> of the <T_9> , but <T_7> congregants , the people who came <T_2> his <T_8> , they had seen the <T_4> . they <T_3> seen pictures of the planes going <T_1> the towers , the towers coming down .
<T_0> nobel laureates hand you <T_1> prize .
<T_5> you <T_6> that <T_0> am <T_3> connectome , <T_2> think <T_7> must also accept the idea <T_1> death is <T_4> destruction of your <T_8> .

i <T_1> this photograph <T_4> it reminds me <T_2> degas &apos; <T_0> of the little <T_3> .
and i <T_1> that &apos;s <T_0> laughter .
<T_3> if you <T_2> to <T_4> by in <T_6> on a space holiday <T_1> you <T_5> this , <T_7> want <T_0> get moving .
frank gehry -- frank gehry <T_2> to me , &quot; <T_0> mother pushed <T_1> . &quot;
let &apos;s try <T_0> again . <T_1> , <T_2> ted choir .
she <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> don &apos;t you advise <T_1> kosovars ?
and in news &apos; case , you know , <T_0> had a couple of <T_6> working on it <T_8> a <T_4> , and then more <T_2> more <T_7> started using it , and <T_1> we put it out on the internet , <T_9> more and <T_5> people started <T_3> it .
the <T_0> long-distance line <T_4> boston <T_3> new york <T_1> used in 1885 on the <T_2> .
but <T_3> &apos;s also <T_4> really enough to <T_0> create <T_2> of <T_1> .
they &apos;re <T_1> either a yellow shirt <T_0> a black shirt .
<T_2> system also <T_5> iconic <T_7> such as <T_0> &quot; take a <T_4> &quot; <T_8> , and then <T_1> a picture of <T_6> is in <T_3> of you .
and <T_2> is , you don &apos;t put water into <T_1> leaky <T_0> .
and what we &apos;re finding is <T_2> , <T_4> at <T_0> brain <T_3> level , we are <T_1> similar .
<T_0> longer putting <T_4> at the service of <T_5> , and much <T_7> at the <T_1> of monopolies of the elite , but instead art at the service of society , at the service of <T_8> weakest , at the service <T_3> the children , at the service of the sick , at the service of the vulnerable , and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through <T_6> spirit of their human <T_9> and the <T_2> up of their dignity .
i always <T_1> things <T_0> kitchen-ry .
well , she <T_0> shocked .
<T_2> , <T_0> his <T_4> , katie called <T_1> up after <T_3> op-ed piece came out .
meanwhile , there &apos;s <T_1> scientific revolution <T_0> else .
all <T_3> , <T_0> let &apos;s <T_6> four <T_2> that <T_5> go together : <T_4> data , <T_7> , immortality and <T_1> greeks .
now , i <T_2> &apos;t know it at the <T_0> , but i really <T_3> &apos;t turning seven <T_1> september 10 .
but on <T_1> more unequal <T_2> -- u.k. , <T_3> , <T_4> , <T_6> -- the differences are <T_0> as <T_5> .
i <T_1> it <T_0> .
it <T_5> an <T_6> . parrotfish <T_7> -- this is <T_0> 5,000 <T_1> spawning at the <T_2> to one <T_4> the phoenix islands <T_3>
so <T_1> think <T_6> closing , sort of in <T_5> immortal <T_3> of the <T_0> yorker magazine , i <T_4> i &apos;d put up <T_2> more slide .
<T_1> this time , i was <T_0> patient .
<T_5> of the <T_1> we &apos;ve confronted <T_3> , <T_2> are the signals in the <T_0> that mediate <T_4> sensation <T_6> reward ?
<T_0> started <T_2> all over my <T_1> .
we are <T_1> that <T_6> has <T_4> in <T_5> and that it has <T_0> use to <T_2> around <T_3> world trying to figure out <T_7> different <T_8> that they &apos;re dealing with .
<T_0> my <T_1> i <T_3> built one <T_2> these out of paper .
<T_0> you .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_0> beautiful <T_1> .
<T_7> you -- <T_2> was <T_4> to get away <T_0> high <T_8> -- -- because i <T_1> very small , and i was <T_3> good <T_5> sports , <T_6> anything like that .
<T_4> have <T_2> fear of <T_3> , because <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> there .
<T_4> with <T_2> will get it , and <T_1> document their story . <T_0> is wonderful <T_3>
<T_0> went <T_1> school .
so <T_1> question arises : when do <T_3> citizens of <T_0> world turn <T_4> the language-bound <T_2> that we <T_5> ?
so when <T_8> was contacted <T_1> the parks <T_5> about <T_2> $ 10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative <T_4> help develop <T_0> projects , <T_6> thought <T_9> were really well-meaning , <T_3> a bit <T_7> .
but <T_2> can &apos;t give design <T_1> for that that will have as much impact <T_3> the arguments <T_0> i &apos;ve learned <T_4> the economists , the <T_5> and the <T_6> .
<T_0> would <T_1> a <T_2> .
<T_7> now live <T_5> a global village <T_6> we can mimic the ties that <T_8> to happen <T_9> to face , <T_2> on a <T_1> and in <T_3> that have <T_4> been <T_0> before .
so , for us , paleoanthropologists , our <T_5> is <T_1> find the hard <T_0> , the fossil <T_3> , <T_6> fill in <T_4> gap and see <T_2> different stages of <T_7> .
let me <T_0> you <T_1> mahabuba .
<T_6> over the <T_5> decade , <T_7> see <T_1> the share of western <T_3> -- and this <T_0> the u.s. share <T_8> exchanges in <T_9> world -- has gone down by <T_4> half in just <T_2> last decade .
<T_0> , <T_3> band-tailed pigeon already is <T_2> living <T_1> pigeon .
but <T_1> can do a lot <T_0> .
&quot; <T_1> it up , &quot; i <T_0> . &quot; <T_2> .
it &apos;s play .
<T_2> &apos;s given to you . <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> gift .
well , planets are <T_2> , <T_1> our <T_3> earth <T_0> almost <T_4> .
<T_2> took our chip over to hewlett-packard <T_7> used their atomic force microscope <T_6> one of <T_1> spots , and <T_8> is what <T_3> see : <T_0> can <T_9> see the strands of dna lying flat <T_5> the <T_4> here .
we <T_0> up the <T_5> permanently , and <T_7> hour we had <T_4> different <T_1> come in <T_3> these things that <T_8> &apos;ve learned into <T_6> <T_2> in the window .
<T_8> could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be <T_2> in terms of <T_0> ; but a <T_1> of our work <T_7> in the field <T_3> technological creativity , the innovations , either <T_6> terms of <T_5> innovations , or in <T_4> of traditional <T_9> .
of <T_4> , <T_0> have to <T_5> yourself , why on earth was <T_1> a list <T_3> done <T_2> ?
<T_1> then it &apos;s <T_2> through <T_7> too -- the <T_6> internet highway that <T_4> internet one look like <T_0> dirt <T_8> on the <T_5> highway -- <T_9> 10 gigabits of <T_3> .
&quot; <T_3> museum is <T_2> pac-man alongside <T_0> . &quot; <T_1> .
<T_4> an architect , i <T_1> ask myself , <T_3> is <T_2> origin of <T_5> forms <T_0> we design ?
they haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the <T_0> of the <T_4> water <T_6> i put <T_2> my mouth <T_5> the <T_1> that i ingest <T_7> my <T_3> .
<T_1> so it started resembling the <T_0> movies more and <T_2> .
i &apos;m <T_4> m. chu . <T_5> i &apos;m not a <T_0> , <T_7> &apos;m not a <T_3> -- <T_1> &apos;m actually a <T_2> , a <T_6> .
so , <T_1> else could <T_0> be ?
<T_4> those <T_6> changes <T_0> your <T_7> over a long <T_5> of time <T_1> hard for you or <T_8> spouse to notice until it <T_3> so extreme and your <T_9> has become so <T_2> .
and <T_4> light can be <T_1> to <T_5> wireless <T_2> that <T_0> things &#91; use &#93; to <T_3> with each other .
now , looking back <T_8> that night , i &apos;d love so <T_2> to believe that i treated that woman <T_9> that night with the same empathy <T_4> compassion i &apos;d shown <T_7> 27-year-old <T_6> who came to the e.r. <T_5> nights earlier with lower <T_3> pain that turned out <T_0> be advanced <T_1> .
jamie <T_2> : teach every <T_0> about <T_1>
we <T_0> had students <T_5> out <T_2> with questions <T_6> , &quot; does <T_1> teacher know when <T_3> class understands <T_4> lesson ? &quot;
now both these <T_0> of information carry important <T_1> .
but <T_1> we had to <T_0> how to make <T_2> .
<T_2> did <T_0> get started in this <T_1> ?
<T_1> by doing <T_5> , he &apos;s interfering with <T_3> activity of <T_4> brain <T_2> for about half <T_0> hour .
but <T_3> &apos;ve got <T_4> grab their emotional attention , focused <T_0> you , within <T_2> first few <T_1> .
<T_9> smoothened out . we were able to save , just <T_2> i left , <T_0> billion <T_4> . <T_7> -- and this went <T_6> our <T_5> -- <T_3> i arrived in <T_8> , we had seven billion dollars <T_1> reserves .
imagine <T_1> you meet <T_7> other <T_2> , any <T_0> you <T_5> a person , your <T_4> , instinctive first <T_6> is , &quot; <T_3> want you to be <T_8> .
<T_1> chewing is actually really <T_0> .
and <T_0> little kid from the <T_1> was <T_2> this .
what am i <T_1> with <T_0> architecture ?
but <T_0> get up at <T_1> a.m .
<T_2> next day , i <T_4> into school <T_3> my brand new <T_0> jordans , <T_5> , <T_1> was cool .
<T_5> one : this <T_4> into <T_7> land <T_1> past <T_2> years , and before , <T_9> reason <T_6> is interested <T_3> your <T_0> , and particularly the united states , it &apos;s <T_8> .
if <T_6> ask that question , <T_1> compare <T_5> denisovan genome to <T_3> around the <T_0> , <T_9> surprisingly find <T_8> evidence <T_7> denisovan dna in any <T_2> living even close <T_4> siberia today .
<T_1> would that <T_0> ?
<T_3> then , again , it &apos;s a <T_4> : <T_6> you move <T_1> this <T_5> , you &apos;re going to lose <T_2> , <T_8> &apos;re going to feel <T_0> and you &apos;re going to <T_7> health .
it &apos;s in the -- it &apos;s in google &apos;s search engine .
<T_2> like doing <T_1> than just <T_3> these <T_0> .
<T_2> , <T_3> the rocket <T_1> down , <T_6> picks up <T_4> toward a <T_5> velocity <T_0> the rocket hits the ground .
<T_6> up the bank , <T_2> young teenage elephant came in behind <T_0> , and he propped <T_7> trunk underneath <T_1> , <T_5> he began to <T_3> her <T_4> the bank .
by the &apos; 70s , home <T_7> was in such a <T_1> state that the <T_3> fat and spice <T_9> of <T_5> like mcnuggets <T_0> hot <T_8> -- and we <T_4> have our favorites , actually -- made this stuff more <T_2> than the bland things that people were serving at <T_6> .
you &apos;re <T_0> in <T_1> , or <T_3> &apos;re <T_2> in love .
let &apos;s start by thinking about <T_5> member countries of <T_2> oecd , <T_4> the <T_1> of <T_0> cooperation and <T_3> .
in <T_1> months , <T_3> do <T_0> train these <T_2> ?
and <T_5> the past <T_3> days , many <T_0> you have been <T_4> me , &quot; how <T_1> you come <T_7> this ? <T_6> did <T_2> get started doing this ? &quot;
<T_5> had to sit down <T_0> make lists , <T_7> i <T_6> ready to <T_2> ; i <T_3> ready to check <T_4> of this <T_1> .
should <T_1> be moving to <T_0> part of the country <T_2> there &apos;s a shortage of <T_3> ?
these <T_1> the <T_8> large <T_7> that allow people to move <T_6> from the <T_4> , in <T_2> from the <T_3> , <T_0> , performers or audience <T_5> .
<T_0> you &apos;re six , maybe <T_1> can <T_2> that .
<T_8> , <T_9> good <T_4> are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that <T_7> kind of miss them . and i <T_1> , a lot of <T_0> , what we do is just , sort of , hold <T_3> mirror up to our clients , and sort of go , &quot; duh ! <T_6> know , look <T_5> &apos;s really going <T_2> . &quot;
<T_1> you were in <T_0> , <T_4> , <T_2> was a <T_3> story .
that &apos;s what drives <T_9> interest in projects like the tv series &quot; keeping <T_5> &quot; with <T_7> san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music , <T_8> working with the young <T_1> at the new world symphony on projects <T_3> explore <T_0> potential <T_4> the new performing <T_2> centers for both <T_6> and education .
so it &apos;s <T_0> series of <T_1> that he &apos;s working on <T_2> now .
<T_1> up <T_2> with <T_0> staff .
<T_0> things that actually help <T_7> build on this <T_5> : the very <T_6> one <T_1> honoring <T_2> tradition <T_3> being open to <T_4> ideas .
<T_1> &apos;s one <T_0> project .
<T_3> are not <T_2> , <T_4> they &apos;re personalities in <T_0> sense of the <T_1> .
in <T_0> experience , <T_2> are three <T_1> .
<T_2> want to <T_7> out how <T_6> work , and they <T_1> to do it in <T_9> , like <T_0> hackers club <T_8> washington , d.c. , that <T_5> our materials <T_3> offer <T_4> courses .
so <T_2> did they <T_0> ? of course , same <T_1> .
<T_5> , <T_6> of <T_4> do work where <T_2> month , we <T_3> something ; we get <T_0> kind <T_1> gratification .
<T_3> can help <T_0> of teens <T_1> counseling <T_2> referrals .
<T_1> and incentives don &apos;t tell <T_5> how <T_7> be a good friend , <T_2> to be <T_6> good parent , how to be a good spouse , <T_4> how to be a good <T_0> or <T_9> good lawyer or <T_3> good <T_8> .
what did i <T_0> ? <T_3> , <T_4> , blinking <T_1> -- <T_2> sky junk .
then <T_0> niliacus <T_3> , <T_2> is not a bad <T_1> .
<T_1> : hopefully <T_0> .
who <T_0> sleep <T_1> night ?
<T_7> when <T_4> looked down , <T_6> realized that <T_1> marched on for <T_5> too and <T_2> i <T_8> to get caught up , <T_0> i got going <T_3> it .
<T_2> , of <T_0> , bad for <T_1> personally .
<T_1> the system <T_2> that <T_0> can contribute at any amount .
so this <T_0> of the <T_4> is the <T_2> result <T_1> india being <T_3> .
and <T_0> found <T_2> scoreboard in the <T_1> .
and that <T_1> our <T_0> bodies .
among the most <T_0> challenges that <T_3> species is <T_1> with today are the <T_4> problems of <T_2> .
so it <T_2> be <T_4> , frozen <T_0> billion years ago <T_3> life <T_1> started on it .
<T_0> then <T_1> pasted everywhere -- <T_3> whole <T_2> .
<T_3> example , this <T_2> spider <T_0> make seven different <T_1> of <T_4> .
<T_3> &apos;t it be <T_1> if <T_0> could <T_2> that more systematically ?
i <T_2> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> . that &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_0> hardy : my <T_1> school dream
<T_0> she stonewalled <T_2> . it <T_1> unbelievable .
harvest <T_0> .
<T_3> don &apos;t transgress <T_4> climate <T_0> until the <T_2> &apos; 90s , actually , <T_1> after rio .
<T_7> you &apos;re low-income in <T_4> united <T_0> , <T_3> have a higher <T_1> of going to <T_2> than you do of getting <T_6> four-year <T_5> .
and <T_0> leads <T_1> specialization .
<T_1> : ... to <T_0> .
so <T_1> can throw <T_0> out like that . let &apos;s <T_2> it .
should <T_2> be surprised <T_0> the whole thing <T_4> up and descends <T_1> paralysis and <T_3> ?
<T_3> &apos;re <T_2> . <T_4> busted <T_0> of the hive during the <T_1> .
he kicked <T_4> child , <T_3> the child <T_1> this <T_2> i <T_0> it go .
<T_2> it <T_0> , how <T_1> do <T_3> think it will be ?
but <T_4> it is the very <T_6> of a game to have no object <T_3> amusement , <T_5> is , <T_9> distinguishes games <T_2> productive activity , it is quite <T_1> to <T_8> that <T_0> of a game &apos;s arbitrary rules <T_7> . &quot;
so we &apos;re going <T_3> represent a <T_6> with <T_0> number <T_1> zero and <T_7> -- zero <T_2> i <T_5> &apos;t believe it at all , <T_8> means <T_9> &apos;m absolutely <T_4> .
<T_9> what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that <T_0> planet can bear , and when <T_7> chop down forests , as <T_6> are every day , to grow more and more <T_4> , when <T_8> extract water from depleting water reserves , when we <T_1> emissions in the quest to grow more and more food <T_2> and then we throw away so much <T_3> it , we have to think about what we <T_5> start saving .
and for the most <T_0> , they &apos;re <T_1> real life-threatening .
thank <T_0> .
i don &apos;t <T_0> that &apos;s rational .
it &apos;s <T_2> weeks into <T_4> genocide at that time , <T_0> of course , at that <T_3> you don &apos;t know <T_1> long <T_5> &apos;s <T_6> to last .
&apos;my <T_3> &apos; <T_0> us <T_2> the <T_4> rises , why we were <T_1> .
only <T_1> do <T_0> construct it .
it <T_5> goes at <T_2> feet a <T_3> , <T_1> all <T_0> ice into the <T_4> .
and to <T_2> astonishment , when <T_5> began seriously <T_8> other traditions , i <T_1> to realize that belief -- <T_0> we make <T_4> a <T_9> about today -- is <T_6> a <T_7> recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , <T_3> about the 17th century .
you &apos;re aware of <T_1> perhaps <T_3> wal-mart <T_2> over <T_4> 30-dollar <T_0> .
<T_3> can <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> is it <T_5> , <T_4> we stimulate it with a <T_1> ? &quot;
organizing <T_1> marathon <T_4> lebanon <T_3> definitely <T_5> like organizing one <T_2> new <T_0> .
<T_4> what <T_0> me immediately in <T_5> hyun-sook was <T_3> confident she <T_1> to be , how <T_2> she seemed to be in her <T_6> skin .
by <T_5> end of this <T_4> , <T_6> &apos;ll be nearly <T_0> billion <T_2> on <T_3> planet that <T_1> use social networking sites .
<T_4> previous <T_8> has , <T_7> think , <T_2> painted a very good background as to the impulse <T_1> my work and what drives <T_6> , and <T_3> sense of loss , and trying to find <T_9> answer to <T_5> big <T_0> .
<T_1> , second <T_2> for the <T_0> player .
mindlessly <T_1> the <T_0> small <T_2> .
so the <T_6> in designing these kinds of situations <T_1> to understand where you &apos;re relying on <T_5> economic part of <T_0> bargain -- <T_9> parents <T_3> the teachers -- <T_8> when you &apos;re relying <T_2> the social part of the <T_7> , <T_4> you &apos;re really designing for generosity .
and <T_8> think the reason for this <T_0> that <T_5> people <T_3> to introduce their <T_1> to each other -- <T_6> know who you <T_9> -- and others of you keep them apart <T_2> don &apos;t introduce <T_4> friends to each <T_7> .
<T_2> good ! <T_0> . <T_3> . <T_1> you ever heard snow ?
<T_3> &apos;s very <T_4> , <T_5> the <T_2> that <T_0> produced lead to the foods <T_1> we eat .
<T_2> the great thing is <T_4> &apos;s no <T_0> like <T_1> the <T_3> ceiling .
<T_2> what that <T_1> is that i <T_0> .
<T_0> know the <T_1> to this .
and <T_0> swam <T_1> the <T_2> .
so he &apos;s talking to <T_1> , and <T_2> some point <T_3> says , &quot; then , you know , it <T_5> it . <T_4> was it . it was <T_0> . &quot;
<T_1> obviously the <T_0> is that <T_2> are maps .
if <T_3> do -- it &apos;s costing <T_1> a <T_2> dollars a day for <T_0> .
<T_0> goes this way .
so <T_0> does this tell <T_1> ?
why don &apos;t <T_0> just say i &apos;m a researcher-storyteller . &quot;
like <T_6> say , <T_0> &apos;s <T_5> cross between natural history <T_4> and <T_7> nasa <T_1> . it &apos;s <T_3> of <T_2> and objects .
it <T_1> insane <T_0> dance is <T_2> now .
i do think <T_2> have to get <T_1> and start to reclaim this <T_4> from <T_0> medicalized <T_3> in which it &apos;s going .
<T_2> it &apos;s because my <T_4> of south carolina , <T_0> is not <T_3> smaller than <T_8> hungary , once <T_7> a <T_5> for itself <T_1> an independent country <T_6>
so , even <T_6> , although it was <T_5> with no <T_0> parts -- <T_3> could achieve high <T_1> -- <T_4> &apos;t <T_2> .
notice <T_0> looks like something <T_1> of a peanuts <T_2> .
<T_4> was completely <T_7> , completely <T_6> , and kept <T_1> to find a <T_2> language , a new <T_5> to <T_3> sense of <T_0> of this .
i <T_1> quite <T_6> my <T_2> telling me <T_4> when <T_5> in <T_3> neighborhood will have <T_0> tv set , then we &apos;ll buy <T_7> normal f.m. radio .
0.2 meters <T_0> here , <T_3> to <T_2> , <T_1> centimeters .
he was <T_2> one that <T_6> those abuses <T_7> saw , because when <T_3> saw those <T_0> , <T_5> turned them over to <T_1> senior <T_4> .
if <T_0> work on <T_2> neurons , <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> . &quot;
<T_1> visualization <T_4> explain , for <T_3> , <T_0> newborns , or <T_2> , put , instinctively , their fingers <T_5> the <T_6> .
<T_5> &apos;m <T_1> sure we &apos;re the <T_4> that <T_2> be <T_3> how <T_0> it is .
<T_3> was in sri lanka , for <T_1> , three days <T_9> the tsunami , and i <T_5> standing on the beaches and <T_2> was <T_8> clear that , in a matter <T_0> five minutes , <T_6> 30-foot <T_7> could rise up and desecrate a people , a population <T_4> lives .
or <T_0> 2.0 .
and i <T_3> that i <T_1> &apos;t get sick during <T_0> book <T_2> .
but <T_3> conversations did you or <T_0> you have <T_2> your mother <T_1> 4chan ?
<T_0> it &apos;s going to give you a <T_2> more <T_3> in your <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_0> of them , because <T_1> love cake .
insects <T_0> animals have evolved <T_5> amazing <T_3> -- but , as <T_9> full notes , many animals <T_1> actually over-engineered . the trick <T_7> to copy only <T_2> &apos;s necessary . <T_6> shows <T_8> human engineers can learn <T_4> animals &apos; tricks .
<T_2> many people <T_9> -- philosophers , <T_7> , <T_4> , <T_5> -- are taking a new <T_6> at what i <T_0> the third <T_3> , the <T_1> three decades <T_8> life .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_6> metal . this is <T_0> , electrical <T_1> , <T_7> they &apos;re getting the <T_2> and the high-end steel <T_3> electrical motors out , and recycling <T_4> .
<T_7> thing about cancer -- when i got <T_5> this , i really <T_2> nothing about it , but working with david <T_3> , i <T_9> watching <T_6> cancer was <T_4> being treated and went <T_0> operations <T_8> it <T_1> being cut out .
<T_3> i <T_2> &apos;t <T_0> he was going to throw <T_1> off .
<T_2> if we could make <T_1> do our <T_3> without working <T_0> undoing ?
my addiction began <T_7> this <T_5> looking diving suit called <T_2> ; <T_6> &apos;s not an <T_0> -- just <T_1> thought <T_3> looked like <T_4> insect .
<T_1> darwinian evolution <T_3> really <T_2> core <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> of <T_0> tiredness .
<T_2> is <T_1> . you <T_5> in <T_3> with somebody <T_4> &apos;s somewhat <T_7> , in part because mystery elevates <T_9> in the brain , probably pushes you over that <T_0> to <T_6> in <T_8> .
it &apos;s rooted <T_0> extraction .
let &apos;s see <T_2> he <T_1> . here <T_0> ivan .
the <T_0> is happening .
<T_1> know , <T_0> a romance <T_2> .
<T_1> means that <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> upwelling , and <T_3> &apos;s basically <T_0> food .
it <T_6> a <T_1> like finishing a marathon <T_5> getting out <T_3> solitary <T_7> and winning <T_2> oscar <T_4> rolled into <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> optimism .
and <T_4> mum <T_6> , &quot; darling , remember <T_1> you <T_5> &apos;t <T_2> and you can &apos;t <T_9> the picture <T_8> you can &apos;t feel <T_7> print <T_0> the <T_3> . &quot;
so every time , i could tell <T_2> story again and <T_1> and get over <T_3> problem , <T_4> so i got <T_0> the <T_5> .
<T_1> seems to <T_2> both a deeply <T_4> and a <T_5> re-statement of <T_0> belief <T_3> god .
now i would argue , actually , if <T_5> look at the fact <T_6> on the <T_1> today , you &apos;re only <T_2> miles per hour -- on average , <T_7> to <T_9> dot -- the skycar travels at <T_4> 300 miles an <T_8> , up to <T_3> feet .

you pay <T_0> in <T_3> . <T_2> are <T_1> currency .
korea <T_0> you what &apos;s possible in <T_1> .
<T_1> are now buying <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;re right at the center <T_2> the whole <T_0> .
<T_0> here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
<T_4> the <T_2> who <T_5> gathering brazil nuts <T_3> &apos;t the same people who were <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_0> you <T_1> see a little bit of <T_2> helix <T_3> there .
<T_0> it <T_1> ...
what nitric oxide does is it <T_2> blood vessels , <T_0> it lowers <T_1> blood pressure .
<T_2> of it &apos;s <T_3> high-tech , and some of it is extremely low-tech , such <T_0> the project <T_7> mkss is running in rajasthan , india , where they take <T_6> spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls , <T_5> then invite the <T_1> to come and comment who is on the <T_4> payroll , who &apos;s actually died , what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere , <T_9> to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have <T_8> to that budget .
it was <T_3> at <T_0> , <T_1> for those around <T_2> .
so <T_9> i &apos;m <T_1> specifying a single <T_8> anymore to <T_2> it , but instead i &apos;m establishing a <T_5> , <T_4> &apos;m establishing <T_7> link <T_0> a property of <T_6> surface and how <T_3> surface is folded .
<T_4> drifts <T_1> very slightly , but now <T_2> what happens under <T_3> w. bush <T_0> obama .
rg : the far left . av : no !
<T_6> you make <T_4> with <T_5> computer program , you &apos;re <T_7> on <T_3> tree , and the <T_1> is that <T_0> excellent art , you want to be off <T_2> tree .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> gap here .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_3> , if <T_5> like , <T_4> ecological <T_1> -- perhaps <T_0> along those lines . maybe it &apos;s that .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> pretty <T_0> list .
<T_1> we &apos;re going to go out and <T_0> around <T_2> look <T_3> at this .
<T_4> turns <T_0> that there were <T_3> nine <T_1> environmental factors -- <T_9> , rather subtle ones -- that were working against <T_6> easter islanders , <T_8> they involve <T_5> of volcanic tephra , latitude , <T_7> . perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the pacific is from the fallout of <T_2> dust from central asia .
<T_1> that <T_0> not the case at all .
<T_4> hippocampus <T_1> formed of <T_2> sheets of cells , <T_3> are very densely <T_0> .
and then <T_6> i went around the country after that and felt the <T_0> -- the fear that was leading to <T_8> feeling they couldn &apos;t <T_1> about <T_9> environment any more , in case they seemed <T_2> to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them , <T_5> came up with a <T_3> quotation from mahatma <T_4> , &quot; if you look back through <T_7> history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot;
and <T_0> love to <T_4> you , &quot; <T_3> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> 10 percent , &quot; <T_5> .
<T_1> we needed to get a database of <T_2> doing <T_0> than that .
they <T_2> posh , they &apos;re wealthy , they &apos;re less likely to have outdoor jobs , <T_1> &apos;re less likely <T_9> do manual labor , they have <T_6> social <T_5> , they &apos;re <T_0> likely to smoke -- <T_3> for <T_4> whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political <T_7> cultural <T_8> , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles .
<T_0> &apos;s not as complex as <T_2> looks . <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> the <T_4> .
<T_4> brainstorms would control an <T_0> that would move <T_1> cursor <T_3> cross the <T_2> .
<T_2> , if <T_1> see the world in such a way that <T_3> sucks , then their <T_4> will follow automatically <T_0> that .

<T_1> harford : <T_2> , <T_0> and the god complex
<T_2> you <T_0> start iterating the <T_1> .
now , it <T_6> out <T_1> are <T_7> which <T_4> called ordinary motor <T_5> neurons in the <T_0> of the <T_3> , <T_9> have been known for <T_2> 50 <T_8> .
bonnie bassler discovered that <T_1> &quot; <T_2> &quot; to each other , <T_6> a chemical language that lets them coordinate <T_7> and <T_0> attacks . <T_8> find has <T_4> implications for <T_9> , industry -- and our <T_5> of <T_3> .
well , this has <T_1> if you like , <T_3> it <T_5> the <T_0> that , &quot; <T_2> , <T_6> &apos;m <T_4> . <T_8> -- <T_7> . &quot;
so <T_4> can we do <T_1> think <T_2> borders differently <T_0> this <T_5> of the <T_3> ?

<T_7> , <T_2> on a <T_4> positive note , i think <T_5> speaking <T_3> <T_1> is probably <T_0> fairly good <T_6> , in the end .
<T_0> maybe <T_6> -- like 2075 , october <T_1> -- <T_3> finally reach that <T_4> day where <T_5> and are <T_2> down the other side .
not <T_4> to <T_0> you would want them <T_1> be , <T_8> they <T_5> be about what they <T_9> , <T_7> only <T_2> will know whether <T_3> can <T_6> that .

<T_2> sometimes <T_3> gets big <T_1> to become <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> picture <T_1> me .
so <T_2> begin to answer <T_1> questions , we did <T_0> research <T_3> .
<T_1> you want <T_6> take the game <T_3> the <T_2> , it &apos;s got to be <T_4> shortest <T_0> of <T_5> game .

and <T_1> she told our <T_7> there , <T_2> said , &quot; <T_4> have made <T_0> visible <T_6> a village <T_3> people were once <T_8> to look at <T_5> . &quot;
<T_1> and imagine a culture <T_0> a <T_4> , <T_2> or otherwise without <T_3> .
i would <T_2> to tell you <T_0> a <T_1> which <T_6> started about <T_3> years ago , and <T_4> &apos;s about making <T_5> forms <T_7> life .
<T_0> let me do <T_3> differently . is anybody <T_1> the <T_2> at all ?

with <T_0> drone setup , we show <T_3> potential for bedridden <T_4> to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a <T_9> playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and <T_1> , where the <T_8> are able <T_5> perform the same activities as everyone else , <T_7> perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for <T_2> people who are presently considered <T_6> .
<T_0> began <T_3> create shapes that <T_1> &apos;t <T_2> .
so , encouraged by this , naturally <T_1> went to <T_0> viruses .
raise your <T_0> if <T_1> do . oh , wow .
<T_0> it <T_2> here <T_1> i met jane .
<T_2> i <T_1> &apos;t know if it <T_0> .
<T_3> we went on to <T_1> dreaded <T_2> . <T_0> , <T_4> got it .
<T_3> say , &quot; of <T_1> not , <T_2> internet doesn &apos;t weigh <T_0> . &quot;

<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> happy , and <T_2> isn &apos;t <T_3> happy ?
<T_1> of their stated <T_2> is , &quot; <T_3> a little bit <T_0> . &quot;
my <T_2> teems , <T_4> of faces , <T_7> , <T_6> , i live my <T_0> over , <T_1> though <T_3> were <T_5> .
but it is <T_3> place <T_1> sex workers <T_2> their <T_0> come .
but look , i <T_1> i <T_3> to do three <T_2> with you <T_0> .
<T_3> it &apos;s actually <T_2> beautiful <T_1> of how much <T_0> costs .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_5> i <T_3> for every time <T_0> open my <T_1> -- that <T_4> connection .
well , as best <T_6> can tell , there are <T_2> two to three <T_5> disks having been <T_4> -- so <T_9> , long-playing records and <T_0> -- <T_8> at least <T_3> &apos;s the largest <T_1> of published <T_7> we &apos;ve been able to sort of point at .
elizabeth <T_1> : <T_4> &apos;m elizabeth <T_3> , <T_6> you said <T_5> a try , so <T_7> not try it and do the <T_2> and <T_0> things ?
<T_3> it &apos;s helping to <T_5> the <T_0> , i think <T_2> &apos;s definitely <T_4> fish of <T_1> future .
human <T_6> that according to physical <T_7> of <T_8> , 40 <T_9> ago -- carlton coon is the best <T_3> -- had been diverging from <T_1> other -- <T_0> was <T_5> the post-darwinian era -- for over <T_2> million years , since the time of <T_4> erectus .
<T_4> bard said <T_5> best , of course , <T_1> he &apos;s making my <T_9> here but he &apos;s making it <T_8> : &quot; &apos; <T_7> nothing <T_6> or <T_2> / <T_0> thinking makes <T_3> so . &quot;
but what <T_2> &apos;ve been <T_4> -- <T_1> i was about <T_5> , <T_6> grew in my <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> .
the <T_3> and pleasure in <T_5> -- <T_7> a <T_2> -- <T_0> -- <T_1> to be considered <T_4> , or kitsch <T_6> or commercial .
among the <T_0> million <T_3> , <T_2> percent of them are young <T_1> .
<T_1> : <T_0> are really <T_2> at that .
i <T_2> down to the end , &quot; <T_3> , <T_0> haven &apos;t said <T_1> .
<T_2> once <T_1> arrived , if <T_0> buyer was to be <T_5> , <T_4> if prices suddenly dropped , <T_6> would incur <T_3> losses .
for example , the elevators <T_0> this <T_2> most likely are <T_1> by <T_3> of these .
bill <T_3> -- and if you don &apos;t know his work , <T_9> should really google him -- <T_4> had a routine <T_2> getting into one of those <T_7> bragging contests on the playground , where finally the other kid says to <T_5> , &quot; huh ? well my dad <T_0> beat up your <T_8> , &quot; to which <T_1> replies , &quot; really ? <T_6> soon ? &quot;
augustine <T_8> that <T_6> capacity <T_3> screw up , it &apos;s not some <T_5> of <T_2> defect in the <T_4> system , something <T_0> can <T_7> or <T_1> .
and <T_0> &apos;s not going to <T_1> .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_1> clear that , in <T_4> to make minds , <T_3> need to construct neural <T_0> .
<T_4> , i <T_3> this <T_9> not as <T_1> a notion of compassion <T_7> you <T_5> have <T_6> in the past , but <T_0> a biologist &apos;s point of view , this reciprocal <T_2> kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving <T_8> .
<T_0> isn &apos;t what <T_1> usually try <T_2> teach six-year-olds .
<T_1> &apos;re not really <T_4> to having <T_0> here at <T_3> o &apos;clock at <T_2> .
<T_3> doubt <T_1> has seen a <T_2> bluefin <T_0> .
so you <T_2> that <T_0> and <T_3> of times , <T_4> you average <T_1> numbers .
<T_3> are going to win because <T_1> don &apos;t play <T_2> dirty <T_0> .
today <T_0> &apos;re <T_5> to a multipolar <T_2> in <T_1> coordination is much more <T_3> , as we <T_4> seen <T_6> copenhagen .
<T_6> crossing the fragmented tiles , faltering at <T_0> step to <T_1> street , <T_5> , <T_3> looking at me , &quot; <T_4> you help <T_2> ? &quot;
of course , <T_1> are <T_2> in <T_3> -- <T_4> the world &apos;s most representative <T_0> .
<T_1> was at the <T_2> of the general <T_3> just looking down <T_4> it and seeing it <T_0> .
<T_4> : <T_3> , he paid . he paid his <T_5> for this , and that <T_1> why he is great <T_2> we &apos;ll <T_0> him .
<T_8> we find ourselves part of a very <T_9> growing global movement <T_3> institutions working on social <T_5> , using ideas <T_4> design or <T_7> or community organizing to develop the <T_6> of a future <T_0> , but through <T_1> and through demonstration and not through <T_2> .
so <T_0> chose <T_2> small spot <T_1> the garden .
<T_4> the <T_1> thing that &apos;s not shown on <T_6> : <T_7> earth <T_3> never had any ice on it <T_5> we &apos;ve had 1,000 parts <T_2> million <T_0> .
<T_1> ! <T_0> &apos;s a beauty !
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> male .
<T_2> it went <T_3> , <T_4> took off and <T_0> got to the <T_1> side .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_0> , <T_1> our experience <T_8> met suggests that if teachers manage the <T_3> , if they collect video in their <T_2> classrooms , <T_6> they <T_7> they want to submit , a <T_4> of them will be eager to <T_9> .
consider <T_0> example <T_1> .
<T_2> i <T_1> we &apos;ve done a <T_3> job <T_0> that .
<T_2> , <T_0> &apos;s the <T_1> little secret .
and <T_1> &apos;re the ones <T_0> basically make the profit or <T_4> a profit , depending <T_3> how <T_5> they are at running <T_2> business .
finally , the <T_3> argument is <T_2> , because the <T_0> turned on a <T_1> about 10 <T_4> ago .
<T_2> me , it began as <T_1> approaching my <T_0> act , my <T_3> birthday <T_4>
<T_0> artist comes , paints <T_4> head of the <T_2> as a <T_6> eating <T_7> maiden in <T_3> river <T_5> blood in front of <T_1> tank .
<T_2> , so frieda <T_1> my dead <T_0> .
but by 1929 , cities around the <T_2> had <T_1> in <T_0> water pipes .
<T_4> for the <T_1> video , <T_2> think this is simply <T_3> best <T_0> .
so , i met <T_0> man , <T_3> in <T_1> office , and <T_4> these posters <T_6> magazine covers <T_5> people he has <T_2> .
<T_4> knows , <T_3> one day <T_1> &apos;ll even have <T_2> own <T_0> bond , right .
and it was also , of course , surreal .
<T_2> that &apos;s not <T_1> right <T_0> to <T_3> at all .
and i just <T_2> them to be able <T_1> hold their head up <T_3> a <T_0> .
it <T_9> the only piano in the region , and mom <T_1> she <T_0> basically <T_2> as soon as <T_5> piano <T_6> , she could play it because she <T_3> learned all <T_4> rhythms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back <T_7> . we purchased <T_8> .
so <T_1> thought , <T_3> , <T_6> must be <T_0> spring -- <T_5> saddle could very <T_4> be a <T_2> .
the second <T_6> clip <T_8> i <T_0> was getting back to <T_3> airport , <T_5> i could see again , vividly , <T_9> camera <T_1> going off , the paparazzi , the autograph hunters , <T_7> book agents coming to <T_4> me up for a <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;s talk about <T_0> .
&quot; <T_1> think he &apos;s going to hijack the plane <T_0> some ice <T_2> . &quot;
<T_0> was here <T_1> four <T_5> ago , talking about the <T_4> of <T_3> and <T_2> .
well , on my <T_4> day , <T_2> had a <T_1> again with <T_3> grandmother , and <T_5> said , &quot; all <T_6> , <T_0> i was <T_7> .
<T_3> fact , the latin <T_2> for hope <T_0> at the <T_4> of the <T_1> prosperity .
<T_0> mom was in the <T_1> .
some <T_0> already <T_3> ; <T_2> are being seriously degraded by <T_1> sand .
in fact , we <T_4> go away for <T_2> million years <T_8> come back and <T_3> chimpanzees <T_9> be doing the <T_0> thing with <T_5> same <T_7> for <T_1> termites and the same rocks to crack open <T_6> nuts .
<T_1> had to hold up an <T_2> of a <T_3> with a <T_0> .
the importance of delivering <T_5> to this region <T_3> connecting kids who have otherwise <T_7> unconnected because <T_2> the farc , <T_8> guerrillas <T_9> started off <T_6> years ago <T_0> a <T_4> movement and then became a <T_1> movement .
and in <T_2> netherlands , <T_3> are very unique in <T_8> -- that is <T_1> the <T_6> constitution states that <T_9> of the main <T_7> of the armed forces <T_0> to <T_5> and promote the international rule <T_4> law .
<T_3> one <T_1> difference : we can <T_6> rats at <T_0> fifth <T_5> the <T_4> of training the mining <T_2> .
really .05 percent ?
but <T_0> truth <T_1> i was <T_2> .
wow .
his <T_0> into criminality was <T_1> .
so <T_4> have to <T_6> , <T_2> there is <T_5> multiverse , in some <T_0> patch of <T_1> multiverse , are there <T_3> ?
and <T_2> the <T_9> i met my <T_6> for the first <T_5> , i was rejected <T_0> the <T_7> island <T_1> of <T_3> , my one <T_8> only choice for <T_4> .
right . we &apos;re <T_2> able to do that <T_0> of thing with <T_1> .
so very efficient <T_1> , buildings <T_6> factories <T_0> oil and <T_5> , and <T_4> natural gas that can displace <T_3> of <T_2> .
for example , in <T_1> , <T_7> we <T_9> more than 1,000 <T_0> -- 10,000 <T_3> in israeli terms -- of <T_8> pest controlling <T_4> pepper <T_6> protection , <T_2> percent of the pesticides were actually <T_5> .
<T_8> if <T_5> do that , you will <T_0> able to step <T_3> the <T_2> that is created <T_6> this <T_4> , by <T_1> piece of the <T_7> .
so , three <T_5> ago , <T_7> got together with some friends of mine who had <T_6> aspirations it &apos;s <T_9> nonprofit , a community <T_0> lab in brooklyn , new <T_4> , and the <T_2> was people could come , they could take classes and putter around in the lab <T_1> a very <T_8> , <T_3> atmosphere .
<T_5> &apos;ve seen <T_2> painting <T_6> edvard <T_0> , <T_1> scream . <T_3> moment was a <T_4> .
and <T_1> turns out the <T_0> back you go in <T_3> , the little rougher <T_2> sounds .
not <T_0> to these things , <T_2> in addition to <T_5> , is <T_4> a genuine demand <T_6> democracy <T_1> the <T_3> .
the <T_1> world <T_3> to <T_2> us <T_0> eternally busy , perpetually <T_4> .
<T_2> elevates <T_1> -- how we <T_5> that acronym -- from crap <T_4> grand strategy , because that &apos;s how you &apos;re going <T_3> shrink that <T_0> .
so , stories <T_1> characters . stories <T_0> concepts .
so , the <T_8> with cognitive science , since we need <T_3> come to that , and <T_1> was , i <T_6> , <T_4> subject of -- we have <T_7> deal <T_5> such a short time with brain <T_0> . the brain was <T_2> to be more <T_9> less fixed .
<T_0> one <T_1> will do ...
the <T_0> news is <T_2> we &apos;re actually <T_1> smiling .
so , let <T_3> go through <T_5> you gain <T_1> you look at the world this way , besides <T_0> entertaining <T_4> about <T_2> desire .

now , i &apos;m <T_5> great <T_0> that mathematics is <T_3> a spectator <T_6> , and <T_2> have to do some mathematics in <T_4> to <T_1> understand it .
<T_6> sometimes <T_1> the <T_3> celebrity , mistaking them <T_0> someone <T_5> just <T_2> like the real person , <T_7> is highly <T_4> . .
the split starts to <T_8> between those in the military who <T_1> a future <T_4> can live with , and those who see <T_3> future that <T_0> to <T_5> them , <T_2> the u.s. submarine community , which watches the <T_7> navy <T_6> overnight .

but this is <T_2> hysterically <T_9> -- <T_7> i <T_1> an <T_3> philosophical <T_6> , <T_5> is , going forward , we need <T_4> of <T_8> kind of <T_0> .
<T_2> is <T_0> percent , and we &apos;re <T_1> to get that <T_3> .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_6> how <T_3> engagement <T_1> be transformed by <T_7> psychological <T_2> the neurological lessons <T_0> can learn from watching <T_8> that are playing <T_4> .
<T_5> newcastle gave <T_3> a <T_2> . <T_4> said , &quot; i &apos;ll <T_0> it from <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> asked them <T_2> kind of <T_0> it <T_3> .
<T_2> it turned out <T_0> was a lot <T_3> in common than <T_4> would have <T_1> .
for <T_1> , <T_0> scores are very <T_2> .
<T_2> can <T_1> do ? it &apos;s <T_3> so <T_0> .
i <T_0> forests and <T_1> .
there is about 20 <T_2> of the brain that have <T_1> modeled , <T_9> and <T_5> : the auditory cortex , <T_8> of the visual <T_6> ; cerebellum , where we do our <T_4> formation ; <T_0> of the <T_7> , where <T_3> do our rational thinking .
<T_8> just admitting this -- <T_9> admitting that <T_7> are right and wrong answers <T_3> the question of how <T_0> flourish -- will change the way we talk <T_5> morality , and will change <T_4> expectations <T_2> human <T_1> in the <T_6> .
and <T_1> is when it <T_0> gets interesting .
<T_5> were some sites <T_3> one percent of <T_6> the skulls have <T_2> holes , and so you can see that <T_0> and <T_7> disease is <T_8> common , and <T_9> was <T_1> quite common about 7,000 <T_4> ago .
how do <T_1> steer a <T_0> ?
and so <T_5> solution that we and many other people are <T_8> about there , <T_9> at this <T_3> there is <T_0> dramatic flourish , and out comes the universal solution <T_2> everything <T_1> days , <T_7> is a cell phone . <T_4> this particular case , <T_6> camera phone .
and when i was teaching , <T_5> used to <T_6> ask <T_4> students , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> definition of <T_3> good <T_0> ?
the <T_2> is called &quot; no <T_0> is <T_1> island . &quot;
and <T_2> despite <T_0> , <T_3> any of us have <T_1> heard space .
that &apos;s <T_0> luminescence , <T_2> &apos;s reflected <T_1> from <T_3> gonads .
<T_0> theme of this morning &apos;s session is <T_2> we <T_1> .
so , <T_3> continued to work on this <T_1> of how <T_0> seduces <T_4> and is more <T_6> to look at <T_2> the actual <T_5> subject <T_7> .
<T_0> who is going to <T_1> to plug them in ?
this <T_1> be our <T_0> century ever because of the <T_3> , or it could be <T_2> worst .
it would not take <T_9> awful <T_0> to anticipate <T_8> after making 30,000 <T_4> in the sea <T_6> of the <T_1> of <T_7> looking for <T_5> , oil might start coming <T_3> of one <T_2> them .
<T_3> numbers were <T_8> mind-boggling , <T_2> , <T_7> we were <T_4> asked , &quot; <T_5> will you start ? <T_0> many <T_1> will <T_6> start ?
<T_1> second <T_0> i want <T_2> talk about is called <T_3> .
and we <T_1> to use the <T_5> not <T_0> as <T_2> context , but <T_3> a primary building <T_4> .
remove <T_0> , the cart needs <T_2> donkey <T_1> .
and <T_0> change <T_1> getting more rapid .
<T_0> right now . wait <T_2> i <T_1> talking .
i <T_0> the future <T_2> crime <T_1> terrorism , and <T_4> , <T_3> &apos;m <T_5> .
<T_7> &apos;s <T_6> kind of gut <T_1> , <T_5> you see an <T_4> and you go , &quot; <T_8> ! i <T_3> a strong <T_2> emotional reaction <T_0> whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
how <T_3> of each <T_0> of tree do you <T_2> ? <T_1> are <T_4> positioned ?
<T_3> with <T_1> . become <T_0> active <T_2> citizens .
<T_5> so there is <T_6> team <T_3> developers <T_0> all over africa , who are part of this team now -- <T_4> ghana , <T_1> malawi , from <T_2> .
<T_6> you <T_4> so , then you are not <T_0> the u.s. employers <T_5> are , in <T_7> , part of <T_2> experiment , meaning <T_3> did exactly <T_1> .
<T_2> is , in fact , about <T_1> art <T_0> delegation .
<T_3> i &apos;m <T_1> standing there , watching <T_4> scene with a <T_0> disbelief , not <T_5> what to <T_2> .
<T_6> i <T_2> , &quot; <T_4> , <T_7> &apos;ve <T_0> graduate -- i &apos;ve had graduate <T_5> , i &apos;ve <T_3> undergraduate <T_1> . &quot;

and <T_4> takes <T_7> active <T_2> center who is <T_6> only there , <T_9> a presence every day , <T_1> who is part of our <T_3> , making decisions <T_0> their <T_8> , <T_5> kids .
<T_0> like the <T_1> of the <T_2> .
but <T_0> know .
bode &apos;s law <T_2> &apos;t even <T_0> . it <T_3> a <T_4> named <T_1> .
actually , could <T_1> roll the <T_0> , please ?
stage one <T_4> literally <T_0> culture <T_2> gangs <T_1> it is the <T_3> of prisons .
<T_6> then <T_0> i have that <T_9> shape that we call the <T_3> , you can <T_1> the legs <T_5> , you can <T_4> them , you can turn <T_8> into <T_7> finished <T_2> .
there <T_0> some bomb shelter <T_3> , <T_2> in the &apos; 60s cuban <T_1> crisis .
<T_1> you spot the <T_0> ?
so <T_4> &apos;s a <T_2> line for <T_3> . and also , it <T_0> be <T_1> .
because their <T_0> say that after <T_1> session is over , <T_2> children continue to google further .
<T_7> what people are beginning to ask is : surely , just as <T_5> invest <T_4> r <T_1> d , two , three , four percent , of <T_8> gdp , of our economy , what <T_9> we put , let &apos;s say , one percent of public spending into <T_2> innovation , into <T_6> care , new <T_3> of education , new ways of <T_0> ?
there &apos;s no sensation .
now <T_1> have <T_2> natural <T_3> about <T_0> trade-offs .
<T_0> are very <T_2> to <T_1> .
<T_1> people , <T_3> would never <T_2> , but they <T_0> similar .
wouldn &apos;t <T_8> be <T_9> if <T_1> technology <T_0> used to take <T_6> of <T_2> was <T_5> good <T_7> the technology <T_3> use to <T_4> money ?
the active ingredient was <T_1> , <T_4> extremely <T_0> chemical that <T_5> in vast quantities <T_8> and whose effects <T_7> through <T_3> genes to <T_6> <T_2> generation .
i <T_1> you to be <T_0> . &quot;
<T_4> &apos;re what <T_3> call a <T_5> , <T_2> you &apos;ll have all of the <T_0> that go <T_1> with that .
where <T_0> it go ? what &apos;s <T_1> ?
but the ends of <T_8> those <T_5> trips were , you know -- something seemed to go <T_9> every time , and on <T_6> particular occasion , <T_2> more <T_3> balloonist who <T_7> with me <T_1> , and left me <T_4> on for dear <T_0> .
<T_3> , <T_2> give you a <T_4> to understand <T_7> there is power in <T_6> statement , i &apos;ve got <T_1> give you <T_5> basics of <T_0> 101 .
there &apos;s the <T_1> one , responsible <T_0> windows and <T_2> .
so , i do want <T_3> say , at the <T_1> , <T_0> i think <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> .
<T_1> if <T_2> &apos;re thinking about <T_0> important ?
and <T_1> was <T_3> off switch , so it <T_0> &apos;t <T_2> good .
<T_0> , <T_9> seti institute , with a <T_7> of help <T_5> me , and <T_6> lot of <T_4> from paul allen and <T_1> variety of other people , is building a <T_3> telescope in hat creek , california , <T_8> <T_2> can do this seti work .
before <T_0> used to just budget <T_8> whatever <T_1> we <T_7> in , because <T_6> is the <T_9> , most revenue-earning sector in <T_4> economy : 70 <T_5> of our <T_2> come <T_3> oil .
and of <T_7> , i was <T_4> interested in <T_3> math , so <T_5> whole <T_1> , he kept shaking <T_0> head going , &quot; <T_6> know , <T_2> didn &apos;t <T_8> it this way . &quot;
<T_0> started thinking <T_2> the <T_9> between communication , <T_4> and <T_8> action <T_5> i <T_1> &quot; <T_6> mobs , &quot; and i found that when <T_7> finished the book , i <T_3> thinking about it .
once it <T_2> a closed <T_4> , with u.s. <T_1> , <T_5> everybody who &apos;s on a board of <T_6> -- how <T_3> people here <T_8> on the <T_0> of a corporation ? <T_7>
now , he <T_1> e again . that <T_0> doesn &apos;t work .
<T_0> doesn &apos;t make any <T_1> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_1> , so you can do <T_3> packaging around food <T_0> you can <T_2> with the food .
<T_1> they <T_4> have learned how to <T_2> gracefully , <T_3> avenging <T_0> winner .
i <T_2> , &quot; this <T_0> the <T_1> . &quot;
<T_5> then , better yet , we &apos;ve got our own version of tuna whisperers , our own <T_3> farwell , alex <T_1> , who can take a <T_6> tuna and in one motion , put it into an envelope of water , <T_9> that <T_7> can actually work with the tuna and learn the <T_4> it takes to not injure <T_0> fish who <T_2> sees a boundary in the <T_8> sea .
and <T_2> design we came up with had <T_1> following <T_0> .
<T_2> , <T_0> all , <T_1> would see cartoons .
<T_0> can &apos;t use <T_1> in the <T_2> .
<T_3> pair , in <T_2> , <T_0> currently cost about <T_1> dollars .
<T_2> think <T_0> of <T_1> is the problem .
<T_2> the other way around , <T_0> you increase the <T_7> of <T_3> three <T_5> decrease the speed <T_6> rotor one , then <T_4> robot pitches <T_1> .
they &apos;re a <T_1> subversive in <T_0> they <T_2> .
<T_0> she was holding <T_1> baby .
and two percent <T_1> you have <T_0> tendency <T_2> extreme <T_3> .
big ideas <T_2> big <T_3> and preferably <T_0> lot of <T_1> .
<T_1> know , <T_0> does <T_4> blair get up to in private <T_3> his fashion <T_2> ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> lift , it &apos;s a series <T_1> buttons <T_3> the lift .
a <T_6> way to start , i think , <T_3> my <T_1> of simplicity is to take <T_2> look <T_8> ted . <T_7> you are , understanding <T_9> we &apos;re here , <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> on with <T_5> difficulty at all .
i &apos;m <T_5> in <T_3> arguments <T_1> , and <T_2> are the <T_0> that <T_4> me .
the <T_1> seeks <T_0> baby .
so <T_0> will get a return <T_2> at some point <T_1> the <T_3> .
<T_2> and <T_3> in <T_1> head , reality is <T_0> outside world .
and <T_1> goes , &quot; <T_0> what &apos;s this fertilizing ? &quot;
we must <T_3> , and we can see <T_1> in <T_7> book of <T_0> son of <T_6> years old , <T_8> life <T_9> four <T_2> years ago , around -- <T_5> billion point <T_4> ?
<T_3> need <T_2> stop that , <T_4> stop <T_1> to be <T_0> beings .
you <T_5> by <T_6> card <T_1> whatever , <T_4> then she will <T_0> you sometime <T_2> the <T_3> two years .
when you <T_6> at <T_5> the <T_3> money , so this is <T_0> battle right here , <T_1> percent , more than <T_4> , is on <T_8> security , medicare , medicaid , a few other health programs , 20 percent <T_7> , 19 percent <T_2> , and six percent interest . <T_9>
<T_9> &apos;s self-inspirational again . <T_6> mean , <T_8> rare <T_1> when i &apos;m <T_3> , <T_7> do enjoy <T_2> . and i get lots of <T_4> coming -- <T_5> and lots of <T_0> coming .
so , i &apos;m thinking <T_6> , <T_7> can we <T_4> the <T_3> we make all <T_5> of things , <T_0> you <T_9> up with <T_1> sort of <T_2> , <T_8> ?
i am <T_1> talking about perfect <T_3> , <T_0> &apos;m talking about <T_2> exists in <T_5> developed <T_4> democracies .
language <T_4> a <T_3> of social <T_6> for enhancing <T_1> benefits of <T_2> -- <T_8> reaching agreements , for <T_0> deals <T_5> for coordinating <T_7> activities .
<T_1> i <T_0> wanted to let you know , it &apos;s <T_2> actually <T_5> out , <T_4> the <T_3> is .
<T_7> is <T_5> the <T_6> of <T_3> earth , but <T_8> two-thirds of the <T_1> is covered by <T_9> , <T_4> land area on mars is comparable <T_0> the land area <T_2> earth .
<T_2> &apos;ve invented this <T_1> new <T_5> that <T_4> much , <T_0> better <T_3> microsoft outlook . &quot;
a professional <T_1> someone who has <T_2> combination <T_4> competence , <T_0> and <T_3> .
of all the <T_3> their <T_7> wrote , they <T_2> only to <T_4> most lurid , the most <T_8> , <T_5> one that was <T_1> for their imaginations to <T_6> : <T_0> .
like , <T_5> have become this . i am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; <T_9> that &apos;s what <T_0> did . five <T_8> in <T_1> school , a few years , you know , i &apos;m at northwestern , i moved to harvard , i &apos;m at harvard , i &apos;m not really thinking about it anymore , but for <T_2> long <T_7> i had been thinking , &quot; not supposed <T_4> be <T_3> . not supposed to be <T_6> . &quot;
<T_1> triangles are the <T_2> rigid <T_0> .
<T_7> you know what &apos;s exciting is that this <T_1> is now spreading <T_2> to <T_4> , <T_8> the <T_5> to <T_3> , <T_6> , moldova <T_0> beyond .
<T_3> want to <T_0> you about the <T_2> conversation that i had <T_1> will .
<T_1> the <T_4> of <T_3> darwinism <T_5> that <T_2> information that is <T_0> and selected will produce design .
<T_4> &apos;re still living <T_3> the old <T_0> of <T_1> as an <T_2> .
i <T_9> &apos;t know if i <T_8> change the <T_3> yet , because i don &apos;t know <T_0> much about it -- <T_7> i don &apos;t know <T_4> much about reincarnation either , <T_6> if <T_2> make me laugh <T_5> enough , sometimes i forget what century <T_1> &apos;m in .
they <T_1> &apos;t do this <T_2> a <T_0> .
<T_7> was <T_0> the flames <T_4> he <T_5> the flames <T_1> he was like <T_6> moth <T_3> the flames . something of an adrenalin <T_2> .
what <T_0> &apos;m involved <T_1> is the transition <T_2> .
well , <T_0> let &apos;s go <T_2> a simpler <T_1> .

so these <T_0> just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we <T_1> open your <T_2> .
<T_1> : you just <T_2> no , he <T_3> not <T_0> .
<T_2> : okay , so <T_1> was <T_0> little bit <T_3> .
<T_0> : <T_3> -- <T_1> see some are <T_2> ?

we &apos;ve <T_3> , well maybe older <T_2> report more <T_4> emotions <T_0> they &apos;re <T_1> impaired .
<T_0> had the <T_7> who built <T_2> , <T_5> we had the people <T_3> did not build it <T_1> just looked at it <T_4> external <T_6> .
<T_8> all sit <T_2> various places at various times on this <T_4> , but <T_3> the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you <T_1> mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of <T_5> idea , you cannot have it until <T_7> achieve this tipping point <T_0> 15 <T_9> 18 percent market penetration , <T_6> then the system tips .
<T_2> : so i have the <T_3> that goes <T_1> and <T_0> .
so <T_0> -- <T_1> you very much .
if <T_2> look at this , <T_1> the <T_0> , <T_4> is <T_3> bright .
<T_3> not <T_5> , <T_7> of pushing left and <T_2> with <T_8> mouse <T_6> with a <T_9> , why not use <T_0> body just to lean on the <T_4> -- <T_1> , relaxed ?
<T_3> big <T_1> the clusters ? <T_0> far do <T_2> reach ?
instead , <T_0> the major <T_5> facing us <T_3> are problems entirely of our own <T_8> . <T_2> since we made the problems , <T_6> can <T_7> solve the problems . that then means that <T_4> &apos;s entirely <T_1> our <T_9> to deal with these problems .
of <T_7> , but <T_1> you &apos;ve seen the <T_4> poverty in <T_2> of these parts of <T_5> world <T_3> isn &apos;t a question <T_0> &quot; let &apos;s leave the <T_8> for <T_6> . &quot;
<T_4> the tsunami hit <T_1> asia , <T_0> united <T_3> contributed 1.2 billion <T_2> .
you <T_0> swimming by <T_1> .
<T_1> it was <T_0> that happened <T_3> this walk-and-talk idea that things <T_2> doable <T_4> sustainable and viable .
i <T_1> self-discipline <T_0> something , it &apos;s like <T_2> muscle .
meanwhile , california , new <T_1> , we <T_3> say , &quot; <T_9> we &apos;re <T_5> &quot; but you <T_2> , certainly <T_4> much <T_8> incidence of <T_6> admitted , i <T_0> , manifestation <T_7> racially-based voting .
<T_1> you have <T_2> computer scientist who &apos;s a <T_0> .
so , this <T_1> actually <T_0> healthier <T_2> .
<T_1> for a lot of <T_3> , that &apos;s what they &apos;re in <T_2> for : <T_0> connections that are being made , one <T_4> the other .
<T_1> a <T_4> , we <T_3> think about all the times when <T_0> do lose <T_2> .
<T_1> li : <T_0> we <T_3> to starve <T_2> ?
in short , when we &apos;re thinking <T_2> academics , we regard people <T_5> elaborate and <T_9> machines , like computers or cars , but when <T_7> revert to being human <T_0> behave more like basil <T_4> , who , <T_8> remember , thrashed his car to teach it a <T_1> when <T_3> wouldn &apos;t start on gourmet <T_6> .
i <T_5> at the <T_9> show <T_0> miami in <T_6> , <T_7> spent a couple of hours <T_2> at fine art , and amazed at the <T_3> of art and how <T_4> it is , but having a <T_8> time looking <T_1> it .
they were <T_0> in <T_2> , and <T_1> mother was <T_3> .
<T_2> there , <T_1> the horizon , it &apos;s the <T_0> reaper .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_3> passion , and <T_0> excites our <T_4> and <T_1> energy .
their <T_1> can get an <T_0> .
<T_1> you search <T_3> the <T_7> that are <T_4> to you in <T_2> world , <T_0> then <T_6> what the constellations of those might <T_5> like .
<T_3> this is the place if <T_0> land , i <T_1> they come <T_2> .
<T_2> kidnapped <T_3> , they put her <T_1> a <T_0> .
you <T_0> be surprised having seen <T_1> as such <T_2> hyperactive <T_3> .
there &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will <T_7> there , <T_0> the sun &apos;s <T_6> , <T_2> any <T_5> and <T_9> that <T_8> then <T_3> be as different from <T_4> as <T_1> are from bacteria .
you know , because <T_2> go down for <T_1> minutes on <T_0> breath .
<T_1> this is where <T_0> &apos;re actually going .
the <T_2> thing operates <T_1> a different <T_0> .
<T_0> are <T_1> of the most fragile <T_2> we &apos;ve ever <T_3> .
because <T_2> has 20 <T_1> 25 <T_3> of <T_0> palm oil .
what &apos;s going to <T_0> the difference here <T_5> what <T_2> kamen <T_1> , <T_4> inventor <T_3> entrepreneur .
just , you know , there are other <T_2> for you to do , <T_0> that &apos;s not going to work out for <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> we have <T_0> ask <T_1> .
<T_5> google test <T_4> , <T_6> look in <T_8> and see if <T_1> &apos;s there , because <T_7> something &apos;s not <T_2> in <T_3> , <T_0> probably doesn &apos;t exist at all .
<T_1> so <T_0> following <T_2> , i went to <T_3> orthopedic center .
<T_3> , <T_0> the young liberals that <T_4> the <T_1> , won the <T_2> in <T_5> .
i &apos;m <T_4> to announce <T_9> , along <T_0> colleagues at <T_7> and <T_5> and ucsf , we &apos;re currently starting <T_8> initiative <T_2> explore biological <T_6> matter for the <T_1> of new <T_3> .
<T_0> &apos;s how small that <T_1> .
this <T_1> america . <T_0> is <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> the point .
but <T_5> you change those <T_6> , <T_1> brain gets <T_8> blood , <T_7> think more <T_2> , you have <T_9> energy , your <T_4> gets more <T_0> in <T_3> i &apos;ve shown you .
and <T_3> do you know ? we <T_0> 21st <T_4> money , and <T_5> was <T_2> . <T_1> !
<T_3> the ants that <T_5> waiting just <T_0> the nest entrance to decide whether <T_1> go out on their next trip , are <T_2> the ants coming <T_4> .
<T_1> name is ahmed . <T_0> am <T_2> afghan refugee <T_4> the <T_3> agency .
this <T_0> &apos;t a <T_1> disease .
these are <T_0> .
so , we <T_0> the <T_1> virus .
there <T_1> no <T_0> -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever .
<T_3> there be tensions <T_2> immigration , <T_4> conflicts <T_0> competition for limited <T_1> ?
and so i took this <T_1> , and <T_0> handed it to <T_2> .
climate change <T_3> mine , <T_1> it might <T_0> financial reform or <T_2> simpler tax system or <T_4> .
<T_6> at <T_3> site that he <T_7> : &quot; star <T_0> &quot; mashups , inviting <T_8> to come and use their <T_1> energy to produce a new <T_9> of <T_2> towards <T_4> extraordinarily important <T_5> icon .
<T_7> , bonjour , zdravstvujtye , dayo : these <T_5> a few of <T_1> languages that i &apos;ve spoken little bits of <T_0> the <T_2> of the last <T_3> weeks , as i &apos;ve been to 17 countries i think i &apos;m <T_6> to , <T_4> this <T_9> tour i &apos;ve been doing , checking out <T_8> aspects of the project that we &apos;re doing .
<T_7> they &apos;re now <T_1> capable of <T_5> any of the <T_3> you would see in <T_4> -- <T_2> like putting <T_0> your convertible <T_6> .
<T_9> actually <T_2> something about a theme <T_5> we &apos;ve been discussing all <T_4> . <T_1> &apos;s <T_8> role of the audience <T_0> an <T_6> of <T_3> electronic <T_7> .
<T_2> is <T_4> -- she <T_0> with <T_1> wherever <T_3> go .
but <T_3> in <T_9> allowed <T_4> to separate , so <T_6> is now a quite separate subject , <T_0> to <T_1> , <T_8> engineering <T_2> the car <T_5> learning <T_7> service it .
and so was <T_0> .
<T_2> used to work as the <T_1> of the world bank office <T_0> nairobi for <T_3> .
<T_4> then i <T_3> a <T_7> and had a <T_0> , and <T_5> decided <T_8> was <T_1> -- that <T_6> absolutely had to talk to <T_2> .
so , <T_1> look forward <T_6> working <T_9> the ted community to hear about your <T_8> about <T_7> to fulfill this <T_0> , and in <T_4> with you , hasten the day <T_3> that <T_5> statement can become a <T_2> .
i <T_1> this for a <T_0> of reasons .
<T_3> in some <T_4> , <T_1> music that <T_5> &apos;re writing for <T_0> place works <T_2> .
now what <T_1> in our <T_0> ?
the <T_0> standards are <T_8> you have <T_2> score <T_9> a 1,000 to be an approved car seat <T_4> this <T_7> , <T_6> some metric of <T_3> which <T_5> not <T_1> .
anas <T_1> anas : <T_0> was <T_2> story on <T_3> .
<T_1> have to <T_2> , this sounds <T_0> .
so the point is <T_3> we could only -- the only way we could <T_0> on each other , is if <T_2> can <T_1> with each other .
chris <T_2> : <T_0> &apos;s long <T_1>
and he <T_1> to <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;m going to skip <T_0> some of <T_4> objections <T_3> i don &apos;t have <T_1> to <T_5> there &apos;s <T_6> .
<T_0> manju is <T_1> years <T_2> at the time the <T_3> starts .
and , by the <T_3> , <T_2> chinese prime minister reiterated this <T_1> davos <T_0> sunday .
<T_4> , <T_7> the <T_9> of what <T_8> good <T_1> is informs <T_0> that we <T_6> , should we stop at design <T_3> not <T_2> ourselves , how does it apply <T_5> our own life ?
<T_5> drowned <T_1> pride , i <T_2> tell you , <T_4> was <T_0> serious , and we seized the <T_3> .
<T_0> you .
at <T_2> time , <T_0> knew <T_3> it <T_1> political .
<T_3> then , <T_5> everyone <T_2> in our <T_0> , <T_4> went to live in <T_1> himalayan monastery .
<T_0> was a lot <T_4> the holocaust <T_1> , it was <T_3> in <T_2> paper .
<T_4> , <T_1> do <T_5> whole bunch of <T_0> stuff , <T_2> they &apos;re very good at <T_3> .
this <T_1> , <T_0> little <T_3> going <T_5> , <T_2> watch the back foot , watch <T_4> back foot .
<T_1> have <T_0> in <T_3> , like i <T_2> .
<T_1> is <T_2> mess , mess , mess , brownian <T_0> .
and <T_1> they &apos;re <T_2> set really differently in <T_4> with no <T_3> at all -- but <T_0> don &apos;t know .
&quot; <T_3> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> goat goddess <T_2> ? the abacazanian ?
<T_0> it <T_3> ? <T_2> has been made <T_5> , by the way , <T_1> certain other <T_4> reasons .
<T_0> when there is something that i <T_4> do want to do that progeria gets <T_7> the way of , like <T_8> band <T_6> umpiring , <T_2> always find a <T_1> to do it , and <T_3> just shows that <T_5> isn &apos;t in control of my <T_9> .
the thing <T_3> caused massive <T_0> changes to occur <T_4> race <T_1> the top <T_2> education .
<T_0> sun <T_3> a very <T_1> cue in the <T_2> for them .
show the <T_0> power <T_1> cartoons .
<T_7> will not <T_6> children at <T_1> , <T_0> then when <T_4> say , &quot; <T_3> , &quot; they <T_5> pretty quickly <T_2> with you .
<T_1> is a very extraordinarily <T_0> .
every <T_0> advances .
<T_5> on the <T_8> times i saw <T_6> on skid <T_9> , <T_2> witnessed how music was able to bring <T_4> back from his very darkest <T_7> , from <T_3> seemed to me in my untrained <T_0> to be the <T_1> of a schizophrenic episode .
he <T_0> goes to <T_7> and to congo <T_2> the aftermath of <T_6> genocide , and he &apos;s the guy who <T_3> to decide -- huh , <T_4> , <T_9> genocide is over ; 800,000 <T_5> have been killed ; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring <T_1> -- into congo , <T_8> tanzania .
<T_0> difference is that when you lost <T_1> ticket you <T_3> to <T_4> , <T_6> &apos;m not paying <T_5> for <T_2> same thing .
<T_3> who &apos;s <T_0> tall , that &apos;s <T_4> first <T_2> we <T_1> up with .
<T_6> think <T_3> just refers <T_4> economics <T_5> &quot; the study of <T_0> praxeology <T_1> conditions <T_2> scarcity . &quot;
<T_1> rossy <T_2> landed in <T_0> .
<T_7> &apos;s the <T_1> , which <T_5> means <T_0> estimate the probability of something <T_2> how <T_3> it <T_6> to bring instances <T_4> it to mind .
<T_8> &apos;s important to focus <T_9> a <T_4> , i <T_2> , <T_1> also <T_3> the <T_7> on the <T_5> there and <T_0> you &apos;ve grown as a <T_6> .
i <T_0> a surgical resident <T_2> the johns hopkins <T_1> , taking <T_3> call .
<T_1> message <T_0> given as a public <T_2> .
<T_5> led to <T_0> very <T_3> , <T_1> engine , <T_4> this is what the engine <T_2> like .
my interest <T_0> in whether the <T_2> had <T_1> .
but <T_5> learned that <T_0> was a <T_6> shortage <T_1> skills , especially <T_4> skills , <T_3> industry , <T_7> government , <T_2> education .
and much <T_0> in <T_3> dvd , you can read <T_1> out <T_2> .
<T_4> flew <T_2> first <T_3> for <T_0> international <T_1> in 1965 , when i really got it started .
so <T_3> access <T_8> all <T_9> -- i <T_6> it can be <T_0> of the greatest <T_5> of <T_4> , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , <T_7> the <T_2> of <T_1> .

<T_2> the 5,000 <T_0> an <T_1> i first organized in <T_3> .
<T_0> &apos;s part of <T_1> long-term <T_2> nasa <T_3> .
<T_6> , we &apos;re <T_4> this <T_5> idea of presenting comics <T_2> a visual <T_0> , <T_3> then we &apos;re carrying it <T_7> all the way <T_1> beginning <T_8> end .
in that sense , i like <T_3> think of my <T_1> as <T_2> local <T_5> universal , both <T_4> here <T_0> everywhere .
<T_1> landed with <T_0> kilos .
so <T_1> &apos;s not going <T_3> change their <T_0> . <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> going to change <T_5> perception .
that <T_1> , in a corporation , is <T_5> a <T_3> of positive <T_4> , <T_0> and <T_2> ?
<T_1> could <T_6> grandmothers being <T_3> to do social-plays <T_9> their granddaughters , with <T_8> friends , and to be able to share <T_2> kinds of other <T_5> around the <T_7> , like <T_0> a <T_4> story .
<T_2> &apos;re not <T_4> given any instructions , but <T_3> forces of the <T_0> itself <T_5> you <T_1> place .
<T_3> the <T_0> possibility <T_7> what <T_6> known <T_4> confounding , <T_5> it confounds our ability to <T_2> out <T_1> &apos;s going on .
it is <T_4> the back of this that <T_2> whole of southern <T_3> has developed <T_0> a services <T_1> .
right ?
<T_0> &apos;s one <T_1> a fragrance dispenser .
and in <T_0> i participated <T_8> a genetic study and <T_1> to my <T_4> , <T_5> you <T_7> see from the slide , that my ascending <T_9> was <T_6> in the normal range , the <T_2> line at <T_3> bottom .
and if <T_1> want an <T_6> of <T_7> , <T_4> and <T_0> in a <T_2> , <T_3> package , it is <T_5> .
<T_8> was <T_7> of the <T_0> issues ever . and <T_5> talked about the neuron and development <T_3> disease and <T_4> and all <T_9> things you might want <T_2> know <T_6> brains . it was <T_1> quite impressive .
<T_4> already use <T_1> 50 percent of <T_0> earth &apos;s <T_5> water that &apos;s sustainable , and agriculture <T_2> is <T_3> percent of that .
<T_0> there are <T_1> charity workers <T_2> call this compassion fatigue .
as an <T_0> , it &apos;s <T_2> hard to set the <T_1> .
i <T_2> with this <T_4> -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- <T_5> we are <T_0> children at the <T_3> of mama <T_1> .
no .
and <T_4> you spend a lot of <T_2> in <T_3> , <T_0> &apos;ll see a lot of <T_5> of <T_1> .
and then <T_2> make a little <T_0> for the <T_1> .
<T_6> , <T_2> &apos;ve <T_3> shown you two very <T_4> types <T_5> cancer <T_1> both <T_0> to antiangiogenic therapy .
<T_4> the <T_6> about solar power <T_7> that it <T_1> &apos;t have any feed <T_3> or <T_2> costs , so once <T_5> &apos;s <T_8> , it &apos;s just <T_0> .
now <T_4> &apos;s a bunch of <T_3> why <T_1> actually do send <T_2> personnel rather <T_5> police to do <T_0> jobs .
<T_2> that <T_8> , even <T_0> , there are <T_5> social workers <T_4> 24,000 pediatric patients , <T_7> is better <T_1> a <T_3> of the clinics out <T_6> .
and <T_0> 10 percent of <T_2> visually impaired people get <T_1> hallucinations .
<T_3> new <T_1> is <T_5> to understand what <T_4> is about , <T_0> &quot; <T_6> , &quot; <T_2> &quot; emotions . &quot;
conductor <T_3> hazlewood talks about <T_4> role <T_6> trust in musical leadership -- then shows <T_7> it works , <T_9> he conducts <T_1> scottish ensemble onstage . he also shares <T_0> from <T_8> musical projects : the <T_5> &quot; u-carmen ekhayelitsha &quot; <T_2> the paraorchestra .
but <T_1> have to continue <T_0> journey , and <T_5> have to <T_3> people , and <T_4> have to <T_6> it can <T_2> . &quot;
so <T_2> thought , well , maybe that is the thing which <T_3> transformed <T_0> in the bottom <T_1> .
and <T_2> , the best <T_3> often <T_4> out to be the <T_6> expensive <T_7> has <T_5> <T_0> , the <T_1> get more efficient at what they do .
and i &apos;m going to <T_2> one of <T_1> studies with you <T_0> .
i <T_1> say , so fervent <T_3> my <T_8> of the <T_6> brooklyn dodgers <T_5> those days <T_0> i had to confess in <T_7> first confession <T_2> sins <T_9> related to <T_4> .
<T_1> our <T_8> world , novel technology <T_4> empower just <T_5> fanatic , or <T_0> weirdo <T_6> a <T_2> of those who now design computer viruses , <T_3> trigger some <T_7> on disaster .
and <T_3> was rotating <T_0> in <T_1> and <T_4> , &quot; <T_2> understand <T_5> . &quot;
so when netra <T_5> i <T_9> down <T_8> make our <T_3> plan <T_2> years ago , <T_7> said <T_6> want the <T_1> of this <T_4> to go way <T_0> ourselves .
access to credit <T_0> be a <T_1> right .
<T_9> &apos;s a lot <T_7> things that <T_0> thought , <T_6> now , good research , done <T_3> african <T_4> and researchers <T_2> with <T_1> international researchers , <T_5> that that &apos;s not <T_8> case .
but <T_0> pay-off <T_1> enormous .
but these <T_1> not new <T_0> africa .
<T_3> the values <T_5> bring can be <T_1> environmental <T_2> , <T_0> sustainability , <T_6> lower power <T_4> .
<T_6> don &apos;t <T_4> think of <T_3> as a <T_2> , i <T_0> &apos;t really think of myself <T_1> as a fashion <T_5> .
<T_2> , it uses <T_3> to <T_0> itself from its <T_1> .
<T_3> have 11 and a half million root apex <T_6> a total <T_2> of <T_5> or <T_4> kilometers <T_0> a very <T_1> surface area .
in <T_1> , the chinese <T_5> said to <T_0> , <T_4> i <T_3> him what are <T_2> doing wrong in nigeria <T_6>
<T_3> don &apos;t <T_0> have five <T_2> . <T_4> , we <T_5> on , and we <T_1> playing 50-over <T_6> .
<T_0> : <T_2> octopods at about <T_1> miles depth .
<T_1> other <T_0> , <T_2> is cyclical .
so , you &apos;ve got <T_3> have a <T_0> sense of <T_2> ; <T_4> &apos;s absolutely <T_1> .
<T_0> deserts freeze <T_1> waters <T_2> .
but , you know , in many <T_0> of the <T_9> , <T_6> are not interested <T_3> opening up or in serving <T_4> poor , and <T_8> is <T_2> real challenge <T_1> those who <T_7> to change <T_5> system .
and i think <T_5> is <T_2> what &apos;s behind <T_1> crisis of <T_0> in <T_3> different <T_4> right now .
so , it &apos;s <T_0> phenomenally active region , <T_6> &apos;s <T_1> just a <T_5> , boring <T_4> . <T_7> &apos;s <T_3> very <T_2> place .
you <T_2> tweet your weight <T_1> your <T_0> , <T_3> they <T_5> keep you in <T_4> .
and we <T_0> . <T_2> data <T_1> conclusive .
<T_0> flowers <T_1> a real bugger .
one <T_1> part <T_3> this e8 <T_6> can be used <T_0> describe <T_4> curved space-time <T_2> einstein &apos;s general relativity , <T_5> gravity .
so <T_4> we <T_7> be as <T_6> as breast cancer <T_1> give women this <T_0> charge , we have <T_2> lot of <T_3> to <T_5> .
<T_0> you do <T_6> for more than <T_4> second , it &apos;s enough <T_5> basically destroy <T_2> proteins <T_3> the <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> little mechanical <T_4> that <T_1> very , very <T_3> step motors inside of the <T_5> .
you can see , in her <T_6> , she &apos;s wearing <T_7> transducer arrays , <T_3> of the front of her <T_2> , one <T_1> the <T_0> , and then <T_5> second <T_9> side-to-side <T_8> the <T_4> .
<T_2> &apos;re basically <T_1> at <T_0> out what <T_3> should do instead of rush <T_4> car <T_5> .
you <T_0> by day , <T_3> it was <T_2> , so everyone went <T_1> home .
instead of having <T_0> smil &apos;s &quot; <T_2> fatal <T_4> &quot; of <T_3> , we <T_6> ensure <T_1> continuity of <T_5> .
<T_1> there be <T_2> to be <T_0> to <T_3> with it ?
steven pinker : very much . <T_4> would fit both in wright &apos;s theory , that it allows us to enjoy the benefits <T_8> cooperation <T_3> larger and larger circles . but also , i think it helps us <T_1> what it &apos;s like to be someone else . i think when you read these horrific <T_7> that were common in the middle ages , you think , how could they possibly have done it , <T_0> could they have <T_9> have empathized with the person that they &apos;re disemboweling ? but clearly , as far as they &apos;re concerned , this is just an alien being that does <T_5> have feelings akin <T_6> their own . anything , i think , that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other <T_2> .
<T_2> know there &apos;s a <T_8> on <T_1> corner , and <T_5> have chairs out in <T_7> , <T_6> i just adjusted <T_4> the left to get closer <T_0> the <T_3> .
and <T_5> &apos;s based <T_2> the premise <T_0> there <T_6> certain things that are easy <T_1> people , but <T_4> difficult <T_3> computers .
<T_7> laurel : i <T_6> to show you , <T_2> quickly , <T_3> a <T_9> of &quot; <T_8> &apos;s tricky <T_5> , &quot; <T_0> went gold <T_1> days <T_4> .
<T_0> he <T_2> this push by harnessing natural <T_1> , <T_6> in <T_4> series where <T_7> used <T_5> to make <T_3> .
and <T_1> practiced my <T_2> as <T_3> as i <T_9> , and <T_7> went from the point of <T_8> people <T_0> me up to <T_5> person holding me up to the point where <T_4> could walk around <T_6> furniture as long as it wasn &apos;t too far apart .
<T_0> didn &apos;t <T_1> buy <T_3> , just some <T_2> .
<T_0> legends , <T_1> fairytales .
he looked at <T_1> hut . <T_0> went inside .
you know , that &apos;s not <T_0> enough .
<T_2> , an <T_5> diplomatic effort <T_3> was hampered from the <T_1> by <T_0> support for <T_4> &apos;s <T_6> .
and emeka <T_2> i <T_0> had these <T_1> .
they <T_5> &apos;t know if <T_0> &apos;ll work , <T_4> they have <T_1> idea <T_6> kind of terrifying <T_2> they could unleash <T_3>
what <T_0> it ?
<T_3> &apos;s still time to <T_4> them , <T_2> we think about <T_5> them rather <T_1> just <T_0> them .
<T_8> we take <T_1> kilograms of <T_7> -- and it results in <T_6> kilogram of <T_4> , the <T_2> nine <T_3> are waste , <T_0> a lot of that <T_5> manure .
they started as just <T_2> of a transport <T_1> that specialized <T_0> smuggling <T_3> the u.s .
so after <T_1> sinclair zx80 <T_3> along <T_4> very <T_2> named <T_0> zx81 .
<T_6> if we have <T_4> , you &apos;ll <T_7> how <T_0> miles to <T_5> , what mode <T_2> travel , where <T_3> live and <T_1> .
<T_1> bring stories <T_0> the <T_2> .
<T_0> they value <T_1> connectivity .
this <T_9> not only outside of <T_4> . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , <T_6> critical <T_7> is outsourcing the one most <T_2> thing -- <T_0> decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of <T_5> web as a <T_1> , doing whatever they want to <T_3> : so , <T_8> .
and <T_5> think <T_0> &apos;s really <T_7> . because <T_3> you can imagine <T_1> before <T_9> technology of the <T_2> was invented -- <T_8> a loss <T_4> society there <T_6> be .
<T_6> : <T_2> &apos;s <T_7> . so <T_4> &apos;s important <T_3> the <T_8> stages be able to come back , to be able to return to the launch site <T_1> be ready <T_9> launch <T_0> within a matter <T_5> hours .
here <T_1> some of my <T_0> .
so , how are <T_0> going <T_1> write your letter ?
<T_0> i did <T_4> what <T_2> did with you , and i told them and <T_3> them <T_1> the whole thing .
<T_1> tried to answer <T_4> simple <T_3> : <T_8> you find a <T_0> language that cuts <T_7> age and income and culture that <T_6> help people <T_9> find a new way of living , see <T_5> around them differently , think about the <T_2> they use differently , interact differently ?
it reduces <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> radiation to <T_1> , <T_4> there &apos;s a <T_3> energy <T_5> .
but <T_2> can <T_1> how it was <T_0> , because <T_4> interpreted according to <T_6> <T_3> and milieu in the middle ages <T_5>
<T_0> i had <T_2> idea about this <T_1> .
dr. <T_7> kern , <T_4> &apos;s a smallpox <T_8> of the u.s. <T_1> department , states <T_3> any <T_6> that have a selectivity index <T_5> two <T_0> more are <T_2> .
<T_1> you <T_7> to imagine doing <T_4> squeezing without <T_6> imperfections , without <T_5> little spots <T_2> there were a <T_0> more atoms <T_3> somewhere else .
so , eventually we have found ourselves <T_1> a <T_0> marginalized <T_3> , way over <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;re <T_0> living life , and they <T_2> up just acting like <T_1> .
<T_5> had to go <T_2> in and <T_3> 600,000 pounds <T_7> the <T_4> in . <T_8> &apos;s stop <T_0> madness of <T_1> plan classrooms right now , <T_6> .
<T_3> how <T_2> clout <T_0> they bring to bear <T_1> they <T_5> to <T_4> on the issue ?
it &apos;s not for <T_0> .
<T_4> that <T_0> will sow <T_1> -- <T_3> the <T_2> of the situation .
<T_4> that &apos;s what you <T_1> to do <T_3> prepare children <T_2> education <T_0> for school .
<T_7> self as we once knew it <T_3> longer exists , and i think that <T_1> abstract , <T_2> universe has become a <T_4> of our <T_9> , <T_0> i want to <T_6> to you about what <T_5> think that <T_8> .
but <T_4> there &apos;s a little tiny <T_0> of <T_8> people walking around <T_2> there , and <T_7> make them small <T_1> , <T_9> we <T_5> &apos;t <T_3> them <T_6> . that is true .
thank you .
now , the connection <T_1> biology and <T_3> and life is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because , <T_2> back then , his <T_7> very <T_4> made the <T_8> step to ask : <T_6> the earth is <T_5> a <T_9> , then what about planets around <T_0> stars ?
<T_1> could just go <T_0> now .
this is <T_2> city <T_1> over here somewhere , and the <T_0> .
in <T_1> , <T_3> don &apos;t think it &apos;s even traded <T_2> six , except for a <T_0> of little <T_4> .
<T_3> starts <T_4> young . it <T_1> into our <T_0> lives <T_2> to the end .
<T_4> are <T_0> fibonacci numbers , <T_5> if <T_3> look at them <T_6> , you &apos;ll see <T_2> fibonacci numbers buried inside of <T_1> .
<T_8> pat one <T_5> on the <T_0> ; <T_2> swagger ; they shake their <T_3> -- the kind of <T_9> that we <T_7> , <T_6> they do them in <T_1> same kind <T_4> context .
so , can we improve that ? well <T_2> idea is we take <T_7> device that i &apos;m wearing , and we put <T_4> on 600 patients with <T_0> , randomly assigned , versus 600 patients who don &apos;t have active monitoring , and see whether we can reduce heart <T_6> , and that &apos;s exciting . and we <T_3> start that trial <T_1> and you &apos;ll <T_9> more about how we &apos;re going to do that , but that &apos;s a type of wireless device <T_8> that could change medicine in <T_5> years ahead .
if <T_8> any time during <T_2> game we want to learn <T_0> about the <T_7> , we <T_4> go into this <T_3> hallway , <T_1> i &apos;ll <T_9> just <T_6> you <T_5> interface .
so she &apos;s <T_5> more glamorous if <T_3> know that <T_4> really <T_0> &apos;t stupid , even <T_1> she <T_2> she <T_7> look <T_6> .
<T_2> number <T_1> comes <T_3> but looks like that <T_0> their <T_4> all the time .
<T_3> runs <T_4> families , so galton <T_2> this <T_1> a <T_5> , a genetic <T_0> .
it <T_0> 1,250 kilograms <T_3> the only <T_1> i get is <T_4> and <T_2> it .
and <T_2> only embodies <T_4> these <T_3> and all this <T_1> because of the <T_0> and <T_5> light .
<T_0> now i desired <T_6> welfare <T_5> all mankind <T_2> could , with a feeling <T_4> , <T_1> my <T_3> enemies .
one of the <T_1> things , actually , i <T_0> , <T_3> that <T_4> &apos;ve <T_8> any <T_7> them , when <T_5> realize <T_6> tiny they <T_2> .
so <T_1> put <T_7> writings , letters , <T_2> interviews , <T_8> , into a huge <T_3> of thousands <T_5> pages , and <T_4> used some <T_6> language processing to allow you to actually have <T_0> conversation with <T_9> .
it &apos;s <T_3> different <T_2> of <T_0> for <T_1> new economy .
<T_2> &apos;s all a little bit <T_0> , and <T_1> .
now <T_2> &apos;m destined to spend a <T_4> of time with some <T_0> , <T_3> , <T_7> special , <T_6> and <T_1> seductive <T_5> characters .
<T_2> tool <T_0> don &apos;t change that <T_1> .
<T_2> she <T_1> ended up marrying a commander from <T_0> spla .
<T_3> that was <T_2> to <T_0> girl in <T_1> hoodie .
<T_5> have <T_3> positions right now -- <T_0> of <T_2> trained , board certified in <T_1> usa , canada <T_4> britain .
as a matter of fact , i <T_1> a lot of <T_3> design ideas come <T_0> mistakes and tricks of the <T_2> .
today <T_3> exactly <T_1> months -- <T_6> for the <T_7> time in <T_4> , <T_2> a single child has been paralyzed in <T_0> pradesh or <T_5> .
now , &quot; <T_1> &quot; <T_3> greek meant <T_0> to stand to the <T_4> of <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;re <T_1> very , very <T_2> with <T_0> internet .
what <T_4> thought i would <T_3> about today <T_0> the <T_7> from <T_1> mode of <T_5> about nature to <T_6> that &apos;s tracked <T_2> architecture .
<T_3> if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been <T_2> about burn , it &apos;s that <T_0> don &apos;t <T_4> how <T_1> treat it .
i <T_2> , &quot; move <T_1> normal <T_0> . &quot;
<T_5> found <T_6> subject <T_4> iranian women <T_2> interesting , in <T_0> way <T_1> women of <T_8> , historically , seemed to embody <T_3> political <T_7> .
this is <T_0> bangladeshi <T_2> director <T_3> his <T_1> .
<T_2> transition in <T_3> out of it , and <T_5> teachers <T_0> a lot of time <T_7> about how <T_1> move kids <T_6> these <T_4> .
now , <T_1> &apos;m not <T_0> 200 <T_3> of chaos as a result of this . <T_2> .
we <T_6> at <T_9> data <T_7> we <T_1> : <T_0> , the <T_8> emitted 150,000 <T_5> ; <T_4> grounded planes would have emitted 345,000 if they <T_3> in the <T_2> .
<T_6> the <T_2> became the best-selling <T_0> in <T_5> world for the <T_1> three years , <T_4> kind of had my <T_3> crisis .
bj : and it <T_7> these bulkheads <T_4> out of plywood , covered with <T_6> -- <T_0> similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes <T_3> adrian &apos;s <T_1> used to make when <T_8> was <T_5> boy in <T_2> workshop .
like <T_0> startle experiments , <T_1> example .
<T_0> also creates <T_3> sculptures made of bones <T_1> cast <T_2> .
<T_0> the bomb <T_1> went <T_3> , he was <T_2> in there .
<T_4> you said to <T_2> , &quot; don &apos;t do <T_3> anymore , &quot; <T_6> &apos;d <T_5> what <T_1> were <T_0> about .
<T_0> atala : printing a human <T_1>
<T_0> treat <T_1> more <T_3> then we actually <T_2> with .
in <T_1> , i <T_2> the british <T_0> service .
larry <T_0> : <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;re <T_1> serious .
<T_1> can see tendons <T_0> muscles .
<T_6> more so <T_4> most , he saw <T_0> highs and <T_3> lows , <T_1> celebrations <T_2> the <T_5> .
i <T_0> &apos;t done anything , hadn &apos;t taken <T_4> to <T_2> world <T_1> bought him a <T_3> .
<T_4> i &apos;ll go ahead and describe <T_3> we <T_1> about these particles , <T_2> they are <T_0> how <T_6> balance <T_5> .
and <T_0> particles have <T_3> discovered <T_2> the last <T_1> , pretty much .
<T_2> have <T_0> and <T_1> and data .
but <T_4> a practical <T_1> , you <T_3> have to deliver services <T_7> , <T_6> , odd <T_8> it <T_2> seem , <T_0> inspiration came from <T_5> &apos;s .
good <T_0> is <T_3> about <T_2> the right <T_1> .
so , you <T_4> &apos;t leave <T_2> normal metal <T_5> out because <T_1> &apos;ll get a first-degree <T_0> if you <T_3> them sometimes .
so <T_0> sent our <T_1> technician out .
<T_1> wasting <T_2> . <T_0> you very much .
<T_9> bearing that in <T_4> , <T_8> a chemist , <T_3> wanted to ask myself the question <T_1> by biology : <T_2> is the <T_5> unit <T_7> matter that <T_6> undergo <T_0> evolution ?
he gets to <T_2> . <T_1> grabs <T_0> .
his <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> and she wants <T_0> possible <T_4> be <T_1> . &quot;
<T_4> it &apos;s <T_3> complex <T_1> we don &apos;t <T_0> what <T_2> do .
<T_1> that &apos;s what <T_0> did .
<T_1> one <T_0> had ever done it <T_2> .
reality <T_2> so <T_3> , <T_1> need to move away <T_0> dogma .
so , this is <T_0> pretty <T_1> picture .
so that &apos;s <T_2> . so <T_1> was <T_0> easy .
<T_3> years ago , <T_1> was <T_4> highest-rated lecturer <T_2> mit &apos;s entrepreneurial master &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_1> see that <T_2> squat . they <T_0> in <T_3> .
so <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> it with <T_4> material -- cubes <T_7> this <T_3> -- and <T_6> energy , and it <T_5> make another <T_0> .
<T_0> is one of the key <T_4> in <T_2> health , <T_3> fantastic <T_1> .
i <T_0> want to <T_1> thanks for <T_2> considering it . &quot;
<T_1> you tell <T_2> where has <T_4> been taken from , <T_5> what <T_3> it meant for ? <T_0> ?
so if <T_3> &apos;m successful , then you &apos;ll actually come away <T_7> , <T_6> , we could actually <T_8> the <T_0> vision of <T_1> ever published , everything that was ever meant <T_9> distribution , available to <T_4> in the <T_2> that &apos;s ever wanted to have <T_5> to it .
so this <T_1> the <T_0> of our research as we went forward .
now <T_2> the <T_7> systematic <T_0> were trying to collect <T_9> all of the <T_4> from all of the <T_1> that had ever been conducted <T_8> whether tamiflu actually did this or not , they found <T_3> several of those <T_6> were <T_5> .
<T_4> upon a <T_5> , at <T_6> age of <T_7> , <T_2> was a student <T_0> st. <T_3> &apos;s <T_8> college <T_1> bangalore .
it is <T_1> we are <T_0> .
<T_2> the banks of <T_3> river <T_1> the indus , now in <T_0> .
so , as <T_6> as <T_5> crab <T_1> them , they <T_2> down into their <T_0> , <T_3> like your <T_4> .
and <T_0> like <T_2> polar bears , these <T_3> depend on <T_1> icy environment .
<T_0> got upset , <T_4> this <T_1> the <T_2> way we &apos;re going to go <T_3> .
<T_5> ? you <T_1> to be like , &quot; <T_6> , dude , we <T_4> to get up in the middle of <T_0> night and <T_2> a hundred <T_7> in <T_3> darkness . &quot;
how would <T_0> bring that <T_2> to <T_1> ?
<T_3> this <T_0> , supposedly , these messages are <T_1> in <T_2> phenomena .
and <T_1> said , &quot; messenger of <T_2> , <T_0> are battle-weary .
and <T_2> i saw the <T_4> link , <T_0> even we <T_1> love <T_3> country .
<T_0> wonder so many of <T_4> people spit <T_3> , <T_2> the truth <T_5> hard <T_1> swallow .
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating -- no pain , no emotions , <T_9> the exception <T_7> anger -- and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that <T_5> lead , <T_1> you <T_4> just follow and do what we say ; that <T_8> are superior ; <T_6> are inferior ; that <T_0> are strong ; women are <T_3> ; that <T_2> are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects .
so , we used to have <T_2> celebration <T_4> year and select -- there used to be <T_0> and <T_3> and <T_1> on .
and <T_1> , &quot; of <T_0> i <T_2> .
and by the <T_8> , i <T_5> a philosophy and poetry major <T_2> school , so <T_4> didn &apos;t know <T_1> difference <T_6> profit <T_3> revenue <T_0> i <T_7> to east africa .
<T_2> is my first <T_1> , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ll <T_3> a <T_0> bit about <T_4>
now , the problem <T_4> the atkins diet , <T_2> knows people <T_0> have lost <T_3> on it , <T_6> you <T_1> lose <T_5> on amphetamines , you know , and fen-phen .
<T_1> when <T_8> go <T_0> tonight , you &apos;re going to put <T_4> hand out there , and you &apos;re going to reach for the <T_2> and you &apos;re going to <T_3> it &apos;s in the wrong <T_7> , <T_5> you &apos;ll go , <T_9> , something <T_6> .
<T_1> thank you very <T_0> .
<T_0> women <T_1> quiet and <T_2> .
and , you know , we <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> those <T_2> .
philanthropy is <T_1> itself <T_2> our very <T_0> .
<T_4> joined <T_0> when it had <T_1> numbers <T_5> i <T_3> have followers <T_2> twitter .
and right next to where i <T_1> to work , there <T_0> a <T_2> .
td : and i <T_1> do get to <T_5> in <T_0> with <T_3> mother and <T_2> , albeit <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s about <T_0> .
here we <T_0> the <T_1> of the <T_2> subject on the left .
<T_1> mean actually respecting <T_3> , <T_0> what <T_4> &apos;ve <T_2> .
consumers now <T_2> buy <T_4> hundred-dollar <T_1> , <T_0> this little <T_3> .
<T_0> , i <T_1> friends in <T_2> u.s .
a <T_4> change in temperature -- a <T_5> change in time -- <T_7> &apos;s <T_2> about a balancing <T_1> between time , <T_9> and <T_0> . <T_6> &apos;s the <T_8> of <T_3> .
<T_1> , what <T_0> did with <T_2> was to access the linguistics <T_3> .
<T_1> i <T_3> , &quot; is <T_0> i can <T_2> to help ? &quot;
he <T_0> with the <T_1> .
jack <T_1> , &quot; me , mama-san , <T_0> we spend the <T_2> here ?
<T_3> the other , <T_4> universe of <T_1> clouds , so <T_0> of <T_2> we <T_5> it &apos;s empty .
<T_4> what <T_0> world <T_3> now is for us to <T_5> that we are <T_1> the <T_2> .
<T_1> gave <T_2> back to the <T_0> old woman .
i <T_1> , you <T_2> see there , pulling two <T_0> .
we <T_1> better decision-making ability <T_2> we play <T_0> .
she <T_0> scratch her <T_4> , she can scratch one of <T_1> , <T_2> can play <T_3> game .
<T_4> &apos;s -- i usually do <T_0> top 10 , <T_2> don &apos;t have <T_1> for top <T_3> .
<T_0> need better <T_1> .
and <T_0> we gave <T_4> a battery , <T_2> a <T_8> of wire , and <T_9> bulb , and <T_3> , &quot; <T_5> you <T_1> it ? &quot; they <T_7> &apos;t do it . <T_6> ?
<T_0> all know <T_1> crazy <T_2> , six <T_3> in <T_5> , you get the seventh day <T_4> .

<T_7> i &apos;m going <T_9> unpack for you <T_1> examples <T_5> iconic design , and <T_8> makes perfect <T_0> that <T_6> should be the one to do it <T_3> i <T_4> a bachelor &apos;s degree <T_2> literature .
<T_4> i <T_1> &apos;t mean most <T_2> use in <T_3> -- <T_0> mean <T_5> imaginative use ever .
this <T_0> we <T_3> benefit <T_1> another country gets <T_2> .
this is <T_0> because <T_3> am a better person <T_4> that <T_8> , <T_6> because of america &apos;s cultural and <T_2> power , <T_5> had many <T_1> of <T_7> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_1> example , which <T_5> put up <T_2> it &apos;s an example of really <T_0> current <T_3> .
<T_0> is a <T_1> ?
when <T_4> kids <T_3> they &apos;re <T_5> with lots of <T_6> : <T_8> and <T_7> and <T_2> and wheels , and <T_0> of tools , real <T_1> .
and <T_3> said , &quot; <T_4> , you <T_0> to <T_2> x , <T_1> one . &quot;
and this , this <T_6> where <T_4> gets <T_5> , <T_3> it <T_0> out that <T_2> beings have <T_1> of an appetite for <T_7> .
<T_3> can go on <T_1> and <T_0> at these <T_4> -- someone <T_2> wrote : &quot; <T_5> thing here .
and as <T_5> walked through the <T_4> , i <T_3> amazed <T_0> i was moved <T_8> the <T_1> sense of ownership <T_7> community <T_6> felt about <T_2> event .
<T_1> she <T_2> frightened . she &apos;d lived 95 <T_0> and she &apos;d <T_4> had a <T_3> before .
you know , back then it <T_5> a way to <T_7> that <T_2> were sophisticated <T_4> cosmopolitan : if you were <T_3> guy and you <T_9> to impress <T_6> girl , you <T_8> take <T_0> out on a <T_1> suey date .
and <T_0> were probably <T_4> aware of <T_3> future <T_5> , <T_2> they did <T_1> .
&quot; <T_1> are <T_0> doing it ? &quot;
<T_2> : <T_1> &apos;m going to run up behind <T_0> .
<T_4> these <T_5> the early days of this <T_3> , <T_0> it <T_1> &apos;t really <T_2> yet .
<T_3> it &apos;s <T_1> with life ; <T_2> &apos;s hardly <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;m sergio , i &apos;m a humanitarian , and i <T_7> to feed those -- <T_1> , i don &apos;t want to feed <T_9> killers but <T_2> want to feed <T_4> two million people who <T_0> with them , so <T_8> &apos;re going to go , we &apos;re going to set up <T_6> , and we &apos;re going to <T_3> humanitarian aid .
so , as <T_3> as we <T_1> in any <T_2> authentic <T_0> beings , then every experience we <T_4> is authentic .
it <T_1> be an <T_0> .
so <T_3> two <T_2> give <T_1> sense <T_0> what <T_4> can deliver .
<T_0> this is what <T_2> inevitable <T_1> looks like .
ask <T_2> , <T_0> &apos;s responsible ? <T_1> .

there <T_1> lots of <T_0> proteins that are <T_2> to <T_3> aging .
you know , we &apos;re <T_4> in , like , you know — <T_2> an <T_5> interaction , or <T_9> smile , or a <T_7> glance , <T_0> maybe <T_6> very awkward wink , <T_3> maybe even <T_1> like a <T_8> .
<T_0> what <T_1> up was <T_2> number of pieces <T_3> data .
<T_6> sethi : <T_4> a city <T_0> to the children , in <T_1> future the <T_2> will <T_5> back to the <T_3> .

<T_6> some people will fund their entire <T_2> habit by <T_7> the little <T_3> , <T_4> then <T_1> have no guys <T_0> your <T_5> .
as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible , standing in front of an audience is a cross between <T_6> out-of-body <T_8> and <T_0> deer caught <T_4> the headlights , so <T_1> forgive me for violating one of the ted <T_3> by relying on words on <T_7> , <T_5> i only hope i &apos;m not <T_9> by lightning bolts <T_2> i &apos;m done .
we <T_2> scolding <T_0> . we dislike <T_3> faces ; we like <T_1> faces , etc . , etc .
the light <T_6> line represents the congressional budget office &apos;s best guess of what will happen if <T_5> really doesn &apos;t do <T_0> , and as you can see , sometime around 2027 , we reach greek levels of debt , <T_4> around 130 percent of <T_2> , which tells you that some time <T_3> the next 20 years , if congress does absolutely nothing , we &apos;re going to hit a moment <T_9> the <T_8> &apos;s investors , the world &apos;s bond buyers , are going to say , &quot; we don &apos;t trust america anymore . we <T_7> not going to lend them any money , <T_1> at really high interest rates . &quot;
<T_5> in new <T_1> : <T_0> having this kind of emotional power <T_6> &apos;s almost an <T_7> <T_3> the way in which -- cuteness of <T_4> and <T_2> .
<T_4> this <T_1> case , <T_2> source <T_3> and over <T_0> been flood basalts .
well , <T_7> are a number of interesting <T_4> , <T_2> think , <T_6> this and many <T_0> kinds of analyses <T_5> hundreds <T_3> english <T_1> .
and <T_1> comes <T_3> natural enemy , minute pirate <T_0> , &quot; minute &quot; because it is rather <T_2> .
because <T_1> manufacturing process is <T_0> organism .
local <T_0> , central <T_1> , now , people <T_2> .
somehow <T_1> have to <T_0> ourselves to get <T_3> our <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s as <T_0> it was reflected in <T_1> line through <T_2> .
you have <T_1> exclude some <T_0> .
and <T_1> i have <T_0> 15-year-old , all <T_4> do is <T_3> and <T_2> and <T_5> .
<T_8> if <T_4> really look <T_0> it , <T_7> when <T_2> comes to plastic <T_5> , most <T_6> it is only down-cycled , <T_3> incinerated , or shipped <T_1> china .
because <T_4> &apos;s as <T_3> this <T_0> is adopting the <T_2> person &apos;s point of <T_1> .
and if <T_1> really want to <T_4> the <T_2> , you look <T_3> the <T_5> over <T_0> .
<T_0> bear with me <T_2> i take <T_3> through <T_1> journey .
bill <T_0> &apos; powerpoint presentation over here .
it &apos;s about <T_1> size <T_2> lake <T_0> .
so , maybe spraying <T_1> on crops <T_2> a really <T_0> idea .
<T_2> : nothing &apos;s in <T_0> pockets , <T_1> mike ?
<T_4> what it <T_0> out to be was that <T_3> staff was <T_7> upset because <T_1> of the <T_2> services in nigeria had <T_8> written a story <T_6> my <T_5> .
both good long-term <T_3> short-term <T_6> and a positive intention like fred stutzman &apos;s freedom , where the whole point of that application <T_1> , well , we &apos;re usually <T_0> bombarded with calls and requests by other <T_7> , with this <T_2> you can shut off <T_4> internet connectivity of your pc <T_8> choice <T_5> a preset amount of time to <T_9> get some work done .
<T_1> worked <T_0> four o &apos;clock in the morning .
and <T_1> started <T_2> at how <T_0> could build <T_8> back-up systems that could give <T_7> five <T_6> , <T_5> hours , maybe even <T_9> full <T_4> , <T_3> three days &apos; worth of back-up power .
<T_2> , i <T_0> , is <T_1> passport <T_3> intimacy .
it &apos;s <T_0> little bit like the <T_2> when we <T_7> had beatles albums <T_4> eagles albums and we &apos;d make a copy of that <T_6> a cassette tape , <T_8> let our friends copy that cassette tape , and pretty <T_1> , <T_3> successive generations that <T_5> sounds like <T_9> .
<T_1> , we <T_3> use disaster response as an <T_2> for <T_4> for the <T_0> coming home .
and <T_1> tried to use <T_2> more or <T_4> in <T_0> teaching , whether it be in sports , <T_3> whether it be in the english classroom .
what i love about this <T_0> is <T_5> solved a problem that <T_3> &apos;t , <T_4> doesn &apos;t <T_2> yet , <T_1> -- <T_6> also think that <T_7> can democratize access to bike lanes .
<T_0> . well <T_1> .
black <T_0> go to aspen <T_2> rent <T_3> chalets . <T_1> at <T_8> questions their <T_7> presence seems to raise . <T_5> taken for <T_6> we <T_9> &apos;t resemble in the least . &quot; are <T_4> ... ? &quot;
what <T_0> art ?
<T_8> &apos;s <T_9> to say absolutely where something is in <T_6> , <T_3> that &apos;s defined , not <T_1> respect <T_7> say , where other things <T_5> , but <T_2> respect to <T_4> absolute notion of <T_0> , which for newton was god .
and is used <T_1> write amharic , <T_3> is spoken by <T_2> 24 million <T_0> .
it is this participation in <T_0> that has led to <T_1> resolution of many <T_3> wars <T_2>
<T_1> follows <T_0> pre-season .
<T_0> they &apos;re really <T_1> distinct .
she <T_4> away in 1994 , and i was <T_2> back <T_0> mit to try <T_6> fill her <T_1> , <T_3> it &apos;s <T_5> hard .
well , it <T_2> out <T_6> &apos;s <T_4> economics , <T_3> it <T_0> cheaper <T_7> give lentils <T_5> not <T_1> give them .
it &apos;s <T_2> that <T_3> extraordinary interviews <T_0> extraordinary <T_1> .
<T_0> else did .
and i worry <T_4> that we spend so much time <T_6> amazing <T_7> that <T_3> anybody can do that we &apos;ve convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating , and we start to devalue the things that we <T_2> do every <T_8> , and we start <T_0> take moments where we <T_5> are a leader and we don &apos;t let ourselves take <T_1> for it , and we don &apos;t <T_9> ourselves feel good about it .
what <T_0> the <T_2> you &apos;re using to judge <T_1> ?
<T_5> that , in fact , if <T_2> really <T_1> to understand human <T_3> , we need to <T_0> about <T_4> in <T_6> way .
so <T_6> it is , <T_3> crowd-sourced , six-word summary of a <T_5> tedtalks <T_4> the value <T_0> $ 99.50 : &quot; why <T_1> worry ? i &apos;d rather <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> temperature has been , air temperature has been something <T_1> 15 , up to <T_3> degrees <T_4> , and people <T_0> themselves .
<T_3> who <T_2> the project would <T_0> it <T_1> others .
<T_7> perhaps <T_4> remarkably , <T_9> the beginning of <T_0> 21st <T_8> , really <T_6> the first time <T_2> modern history , growth <T_1> to almost <T_3> parts of the <T_5> .
and <T_0> who <T_2> deliberating -- &quot; <T_3> i return <T_1> ?
<T_1> outside in the <T_3> he said <T_2> me , &quot; you <T_0> what , <T_4> ?
and along <T_2> way , please <T_0> time to smell the <T_5> , especially <T_3> you and <T_1> students grew <T_4> .
the <T_4> york <T_3> followed <T_0> around everywhere , and <T_1> was rooting for <T_2> .
<T_3> just toss <T_0> to <T_6> pile , and <T_5> &apos;s added right to the <T_4> . <T_2> &apos;s a kind of <T_1> way .
and <T_9> that <T_3> -- it <T_8> many <T_1> -- one of <T_5> doctors <T_7> that my recovery , my degree of <T_2> , <T_0> the <T_6> of <T_4> injury i &apos;d suffered , was miraculous .
<T_1> , quite frankly , <T_0> this <T_4> , <T_2> is no other <T_3> .
whether <T_7> &apos;re talking <T_1> beef cattle <T_9> we &apos;re talking about chickens , or we &apos;re talking about broccoli or <T_5> sprouts , or <T_8> the case of this <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> york <T_3> , <T_2> -- which <T_6> are going out of business .
<T_2> , <T_1> do <T_0> guarantee you economic growth .
and <T_2> red dots <T_0> the <T_4> congested <T_6> , which are <T_1> bridges that <T_5> into the <T_3> city .
and then , also , was <T_1> with broad <T_0> .
could you give <T_1> a flight ? because we &apos;re going to go <T_0> him . &quot;
well , <T_2> &apos;s go <T_0> to this <T_1> .
this <T_1> , <T_2> ben <T_5> has said , <T_7> chaotic unwinding of <T_4> world &apos;s financial system , it &apos;s about -- they <T_3> &apos;t know , <T_0> didn &apos;t know what they <T_6> doing .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_5> new social <T_2> , so to speak , <T_3> could become as <T_0> as <T_1> credit rating .

and <T_3> get to <T_5> about <T_4> and your <T_0> , and before <T_8> go back <T_1> suspension , you edit <T_7> memories <T_9> you change <T_6> personality and so <T_2> .
<T_1> linguists <T_2> things like that <T_0> particles .
<T_5> this was <T_1> of <T_0> instances <T_7> i realized <T_6> much <T_4> our relationship , <T_2> flattening this sort <T_3> world .
it &apos;s not <T_1> that it was <T_0> . <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> all along .
i <T_2> this piece because <T_1> have a little cousin at <T_7> who introduced <T_0> -- which <T_9> think is such <T_4> great <T_8> -- to a <T_6> one <T_5> as , &quot; this is my <T_3> shea .
<T_5> we don &apos;t have <T_1> answer to that <T_6> , <T_3> we spend a <T_4> of time <T_0> to <T_2> that out .
you do find groups <T_0> the animal kingdom -- <T_3> do find cooperative <T_4> -- <T_2> these <T_1> are always <T_8> very <T_6> or <T_5> &apos;re all <T_7> .
i <T_0> the word <T_1> was great .
museum quality .
get <T_0> of your <T_1> .
the <T_2> was that <T_1> listened to the <T_0> story .
even <T_0> england , we <T_3> &apos;t <T_1> reproduction to <T_2> queen .
it <T_2> too much <T_1> begging <T_3> stand there with the <T_0> .
this is <T_0> zip from <T_2> , north <T_1> .
and in <T_7> , you &apos;ve probably <T_9> heard the analogy that <T_2> genome is like <T_0> blueprint of your <T_5> , and if <T_1> were only <T_4> , it <T_8> be <T_3> , but it &apos;s <T_6> .
<T_1> non-professional circles outside <T_2> , it &apos;s <T_0> ignored .
and <T_1> grows on a very regular <T_0> basis .
google <T_0> itself by enriching <T_3> of <T_1> through <T_2> .
<T_7> if <T_3> look at an image of smithfield in <T_4> you can see that <T_1> would have been very <T_0> to <T_8> in a <T_6> like this and be <T_9> of <T_5> your <T_2> came from .
<T_1> was speaking <T_7> a <T_5> of my friends <T_9> the <T_0> business , <T_3> they -- <T_4> asked them , &quot; so what &apos;s one <T_2> you would like <T_8> to <T_6> more about ? &quot;
<T_2> let &apos;s take a look <T_0> my <T_1> .
&quot; something &apos;s wrong <T_2> the <T_1> conditioner -- <T_4> of <T_0> v-belts <T_5> the <T_3> . &quot;
<T_9> if we take that notion of <T_0> global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not <T_5> in government , though <T_6> would have government &apos;s blessing , nor in international <T_2> , but in <T_7> many existing <T_4> and <T_1> society leaders who already <T_8> building wonderful innovations that are reaching people <T_3> across the country .
so a <T_1> , it &apos;s <T_2> good to go <T_0> .
<T_2> the <T_0> without <T_1> .
and yet , at <T_2> end , <T_0> &apos;s so <T_3> to <T_4> a <T_1> .
i <T_0> , i <T_1> sometimes <T_2> lifestyles are <T_3> different , whatever .
<T_1> are <T_0> billion neurons <T_3> the adult <T_2> brain .
then <T_0> was <T_2> kader , who was <T_1> palestinian-american .
<T_1> i <T_3> , <T_0> , <T_2> jew from new <T_4> , right ?
so when we meet in my <T_6> class <T_8> his <T_2> and <T_0> say , &quot; <T_1> this <T_5> , we <T_9> discuss <T_3> foundations of <T_7> , &quot; <T_4> interrupts me .
<T_6> can ask , how do you <T_2> up for positive <T_4> , for <T_5> , for <T_0> , against literally <T_3> of other <T_1> ?
trojan horses <T_1> our computer networks <T_0> all our <T_3> &apos; heels <T_2> .
<T_7> investigate <T_9> of the <T_0> , pseudo-science , and fringe groups and <T_4> and <T_8> of all kinds between -- science and pseudo-science <T_2> non-science <T_1> junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , <T_5> science , non-science <T_3> plain old <T_6> .
we <T_2> focus on one <T_9> , one <T_1> , one problem , but <T_0> experience suggests <T_6> we <T_3> take the <T_8> to apply <T_7> broadly between systems and <T_4> see where it takes <T_5> .
we &apos;re <T_2> in <T_4> time of mass <T_1> that exceeds the <T_0> record by <T_3> factor of 10,000 .
everything <T_4> know <T_1> made of some <T_3> of <T_0> you see <T_2> here .
he <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> . &quot;
overall , if you looked <T_6> all the <T_5> in all the <T_1> , they <T_2> worse and worse , from one <T_4> to five <T_0> , in <T_3> comparison group .
<T_2> mean , <T_4> that <T_0> , trust <T_3> , <T_5> were <T_1> referring to the israeli and palestinian <T_6> .
<T_1> will <T_0> around 2020 .
and <T_3> answer <T_9> , <T_6> most important <T_1> we need to do is to <T_4> about there <T_0> any single <T_8> that is the <T_2> important <T_7> we <T_5> to do .
so <T_1> &apos;s totally <T_0> .
<T_6> have been really <T_1> with <T_5> technology : <T_3> of <T_0> sudden as it is ready , the <T_2> is ready to <T_4> it .
<T_3> : you &apos;re going <T_2> get one ! you &apos;re <T_1> to <T_0> one !
<T_1> &apos;s what i have <T_0> myself .
and <T_0> the building <T_2> the back , you see <T_1> as an iceberg floating by <T_3> the <T_4> .
it <T_3> out that people <T_0> with <T_2> robot <T_6> more , even <T_7> the <T_1> of the <T_5> was identical to the <T_4> .
<T_2> vivian and <T_1> have been working together <T_0> 23 <T_3> .
<T_1> is tim <T_0> circa <T_3> a.d. age <T_2> .
<T_1> know why <T_0> do this ?
now , that was a <T_3> good system <T_2> most of the <T_9> of <T_8> regulation of land , until this <T_6> came along , and people <T_4> , were these instruments <T_5> as <T_7> flew over <T_0> without clearing the <T_1> of the farms below as they traveled across the country ?
<T_1> president <T_2> seen <T_0> those rules worked <T_3> .
<T_0> are <T_4> that are acquired <T_1> part of their <T_2> experiences <T_3> others .
<T_4> was <T_1> by <T_3> huffard and filmed by <T_0> studios , <T_5> here <T_2> monterey .
these <T_0> links that <T_4> , these <T_3> , <T_1> of <T_5> , <T_2> hold us .
<T_2> let <T_0> tell you a little bit about <T_1> the <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s why <T_0> &apos;s intuitive .
<T_4> the other <T_3> , <T_5> is declining <T_2> because <T_0> climate change <T_1> because of other factors .
but <T_9> , <T_4> found a <T_5> online for <T_8> furnaces <T_2> use microwaves , and at 30 <T_0> at <T_6> power , and <T_1> was <T_3> to <T_7> off the process .
and <T_0> goes , &quot; <T_2> i just can &apos;t <T_1> it . &quot;
<T_0> a <T_1> pianist , <T_3> the great cult pianist of <T_2> twentieth <T_4> .
and the <T_2> of this is what makes <T_0> work , seen with all its <T_1> .
and as <T_1> &apos;ve <T_8> here , <T_2> is no exaggeration <T_4> say <T_5> we hold <T_6> future of <T_3> civilization in our <T_0> as never <T_7> .
and this <T_4> a <T_3> clip <T_2> an elementary school , which is <T_1> common <T_0> england .
and there will be about <T_0> 20 percent <T_1> we &apos;ll recover him .
&quot; i &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
it is <T_4> and <T_3> girls who <T_0> most keenly <T_1> of its <T_2> beauty .
and <T_1> you <T_0> on your reserve , and <T_2> you put on <T_3> heavy rucksack .
started doing <T_0> , we <T_4> have to redesign the <T_1> system from <T_3> ground up <T_2>
<T_2> work <T_3> persistence --don &apos;t give up -- <T_4> love <T_5> compassion leading <T_0> respect for <T_1> life .
<T_3> the biggest change for the worse <T_1> that <T_0> elderly are objectively <T_4> useful than <T_2> traditional <T_5> .
so long-distance movement of <T_0> is a <T_1> of <T_3> , not <T_2> .
<T_1> adaptation would be <T_0> piece .
and <T_2> know , <T_1> more creative <T_4> them might get to <T_0> really <T_3> example .
and <T_1> two <T_3> the <T_0> was closed to the <T_2> .
so after <T_0> the <T_1> , when he left , we were <T_4> for <T_2> to <T_3> the goods .
but i don &apos;t think we should <T_4> the extent <T_3> which massive changes in <T_5> make possible the <T_0> up of <T_2> across the <T_1> .
i <T_0> want to <T_1> one .
<T_1> means <T_4> what <T_0> take for <T_5> , things <T_2> we think are <T_3> .
so if <T_2> family suffers <T_3> one cot <T_0> , you &apos;d put them in <T_1> high-risk <T_4> .
<T_0> whole animal world <T_3> lives <T_7> a stockpile of <T_2> oxygen that is cycled <T_4> through plants <T_8> algae , and <T_5> waste <T_6> our <T_9> , <T_1> vice versa .
<T_2> you think <T_7> the <T_1> of wikipedia <T_8> everyone is <T_6> content , <T_4> at the end of the day you &apos;ve built <T_3> largest <T_0> in the <T_5> .
and <T_8> , <T_1> vote <T_7> encrypted from the <T_6> you <T_9> the voting booth , so <T_5> an <T_2> official wants <T_3> find out <T_4> you voted , they will not be <T_0> to .
<T_6> , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially <T_1> passion for judge judy , and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little <T_2> that you <T_8> the central passion <T_5> my life , a <T_9> for the live professional performing arts , performing <T_7> that represent the <T_4> repertoire <T_3> yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and <T_0> and more and more .
well , we &apos;ve now <T_2> 4,000 <T_0> and <T_1> procedures .
<T_2> &apos;s the <T_0> flat <T_6> you <T_4> reach after <T_5> get up to the <T_1> of the <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;s an <T_1> . <T_0> about that .
<T_1> &apos;t know <T_3> they do with <T_2> , but <T_0> have <T_4> .
<T_1> examples <T_0> a trend .
<T_0> we <T_1> a lot of <T_4> to gain <T_5> we can <T_3> solar <T_2> base load energy supply for the world .
learning the <T_0> that has accumulated over time and reading <T_1> message left by <T_2> ancestors <T_6> better <T_3> any consolation therapy <T_8> piece of <T_7> any living <T_5> could <T_4> me .
the <T_3> that this <T_0> is enabling us <T_1> do is coming <T_2> .
they <T_2> wanted congress <T_0> outlaw <T_1> full-stop .
and the <T_0> morning , <T_3> knew <T_5> she could get <T_4> a <T_1> village where there was a foreign missionary , <T_2> would be saved .
and <T_6> one <T_4> i did <T_1> submit , which <T_0> still <T_5> , <T_3> wanted to use the <T_2> phrase .
in other <T_0> , <T_2> rate of increase <T_1> exponential .
<T_1> : <T_0> !
so , what i <T_6> to <T_9> , <T_5> know , this being <T_8> of <T_0> area , silicon <T_4> -- <T_7> that we think <T_2> mcdonald &apos;s as <T_3> of the microsoft <T_1> the dining experiences .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> to say <T_2> there are 2,000 <T_3> .
when <T_3> asked about men , what do <T_4> in this <T_1> need to do <T_9> conform with male <T_0> , the answers <T_8> : always show emotional <T_5> , work is <T_2> , <T_7> status and <T_6> .
<T_0> 100 <T_2> whole-grain wheat <T_1> a delicious diamond shape .
<T_1> isn &apos;t a dog <T_2> this <T_3> that &apos;s a natural <T_0> .
<T_1> began to shut <T_3> the <T_0> that the <T_2> were happening on .
medullary <T_1> is <T_4> calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when <T_2> animal is <T_3> , when <T_0> bird is <T_5> .
and <T_5> &apos;s it . <T_0> was going to bring an <T_3> , but <T_2> was worried about hitting people in <T_1> , so i <T_4> this would be a little bit more <T_6> .
<T_2> for <T_4> reason , in cameroon , when they tried <T_1> translate <T_0> bible into <T_3> patois , <T_5> chose the igbo version .
use <T_1> mailing lists . <T_2> in this room <T_3> extraordinary <T_0> .
let me just give you <T_1> few <T_5> , <T_4> of <T_0> and the <T_3> on <T_2> skill .
thank you .
<T_0> would say <T_2> the converse <T_1> true .
as i <T_3> , <T_1> can &apos;t deal <T_0> the environmental <T_2> institutions .
i <T_4> trying to think , how is <T_0> connected to <T_2> , and it occurred to <T_3> that <T_1> some reason we take pleasure in <T_5> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_2> i want to say , <T_1> i &apos;ve <T_3> three minutes <T_0> .
and so <T_0> have a <T_2> , <T_3> seems <T_1> me .
<T_9> drag him out <T_4> the boat , and <T_2> &apos;s -- <T_6> , i <T_1> &apos;t see any of this -- but lying <T_0> the <T_3> and giving <T_8> epinephrine <T_7> and <T_5> out .
clearly , <T_2> it <T_3> action video <T_1> , screen time <T_4> &apos;t make your <T_0> worse .
<T_1> machines <T_2> no <T_0> for empathy .
<T_0> is <T_2> ; this <T_1> closed .
second , we <T_0> both <T_4> for <T_1> the victims of <T_2> own <T_3> .
and it <T_6> struck me <T_2> the years went by , in a very negative way , <T_9> i would go to <T_3> stream that i &apos;d <T_7> , and was used to <T_5> through this <T_0> that was once filled with <T_4> , and now had <T_8> strip mall or a <T_1> of condos on it .
but <T_4> was very <T_3> to have been brought up <T_6> kenya , <T_0> accompanying <T_7> parents <T_5> lake turkana <T_1> search of <T_2> remains .
and <T_3> spite of <T_5> having quite a <T_2> income , <T_1> have a <T_0> number <T_4> hiv infected .
<T_1> value <T_0> nothing : <T_2> of nothing comes <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;ve shared <T_0> .
and <T_1> inspired an ian mcewan novel i think <T_0> that .
<T_3> used <T_2> microscopic <T_0> of diamond <T_1> actually <T_4> the actual base .
so , will <T_0> find the <T_1> of physics ?
<T_1> made a hypothesis , <T_0> ridiculous hypothesis .
one <T_3> war , the <T_2> army , which <T_1> don &apos;t <T_4> to <T_0> very often .
and so many of the talks here at ted are about meaning , about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways , through technology , <T_0> art , through science , so much so that <T_4> think we focus so <T_9> on <T_6> side of our lives , <T_1> we <T_5> &apos;t given enough <T_2> to the food and the <T_3> and the shelter , <T_8> what we <T_7> to raise the kids .
this went down very <T_0> in the u.k. , <T_2> religion is <T_1> unpopular .
so <T_3> can &apos;t look <T_5> state-of-the-art <T_2> in renewables <T_1> say , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s all <T_0> have . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;s flowing out to <T_2> atlantic ocean on <T_1> left .
now , capturing <T_4> correlating the trails <T_0> information that <T_5> leave in different <T_3> is <T_7> massive <T_8> , <T_1> one <T_6> &apos;re being asked <T_2> figure out .
comes <T_1> , goes into the <T_4> , <T_0> , &quot; well <T_3> &apos;s the <T_2> ? &quot;
who <T_2> likes the <T_0> of <T_1> pollock ?
and he <T_0> it hypothesis-free <T_1> .
if <T_2> ball costs <T_0> , the <T_1> costs ...
<T_0> you very much .
<T_1> the client <T_2> , &quot; <T_0> no <T_3> ? &quot;
do you ? <T_2> you <T_0> &apos;t think of shakespeare being <T_1> child , do you ?
the <T_2> itself is a <T_1> . it <T_0> not a <T_3> .
there are <T_5> and also <T_4> in <T_2> field <T_0> aerodynamics in <T_1> field <T_3> building gliders .
and if , <T_5> generation or two ago , the big challenges were <T_2> like getting a man on the moon , perhaps the challenges <T_9> need to set ourselves now <T_8> ones like <T_3> child malnutrition , <T_6> trafficking , or one , i think closer to home for <T_4> or europe , why don &apos;t we set <T_0> the goal of achieving a <T_7> extra years of life <T_1> today &apos;s citizens .
<T_3> before <T_0> go any further , <T_1> is something <T_2> sharing .
<T_6> think <T_2> &apos;s important <T_5> kind of look at <T_3> pictures of <T_4> birds <T_0> understand what <T_1> to us .
and <T_0> have <T_2> celebrations , <T_1> we &apos;ve actually started <T_4> -- you know , we &apos;ve seen <T_3> worst of it .
this <T_0> of <T_2> to and <T_3> large , <T_5> healthcare systems actually <T_1> in <T_4> .
<T_3> is now <T_0> toilet <T_1> has an <T_2> player in it .
<T_2> &apos;ve got a <T_3> confused <T_1> which <T_5> makes me <T_4> for <T_0> times .
now <T_1> education system is predicated <T_0> the idea of <T_2> ability .
<T_0> is an <T_1> mra mrv , <T_3> volumetric <T_2> .
<T_2> can <T_5> to enjoy <T_6> food , and we <T_3> to <T_1> well , and we <T_0> eat even <T_4> .
we <T_0> are the <T_1> .
and so <T_1> language really is the solution to the crisis of <T_8> theft , if language really is <T_6> conduit of our <T_9> , the <T_3> that our <T_7> derived <T_5> promote the free flow and exchange <T_4> ideas , in our <T_0> world , <T_2> confront a question .
so i <T_4> these <T_2> i &apos;ve showed <T_7> are <T_3> a <T_1> step towards <T_5> future , if <T_9> implement these <T_0> technologies <T_8> a <T_6> self-assembling world .
<T_1> is <T_0> we <T_2> for certain .
so , returning <T_6> tactics <T_4> the <T_2> lobby , i <T_7> to <T_3> that <T_0> the boat may be <T_5> the <T_1> thing to do .
this is the <T_2> for the project <T_5> , <T_0> we will <T_4> you all the <T_3> , &quot; and <T_1> gave .
my <T_2> would force <T_6> to <T_1> you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother &apos;s side or my father &apos;s side , whether this was <T_7> uncle by marriage <T_9> by birth , <T_8> if <T_0> man was my father &apos;s <T_4> , whether <T_3> was older than or younger <T_5> my father .
and so i <T_4> to walk into this building and be met with this <T_5> of honking and <T_8> and <T_2> , <T_0> instead , when <T_7> stepped through <T_9> doors and <T_6> the <T_3> , it was eerily <T_1> .
and we also , frankly , knew that if it didn &apos;t happen by the end of the <T_2> administration , <T_3> everyone who we were dealing with at the <T_8> and <T_9> police department <T_1> all of the -- we <T_4> meeting <T_7> 20 or 30 people <T_6> the city at a time , and it was set up <T_5> the office of emergency <T_0> .
<T_1> we thought of starting <T_2> school <T_0> night <T_3> the children .
<T_2> type i error , <T_5> false <T_1> , is <T_0> a <T_4> is real when <T_3> &apos;s <T_6> .
<T_1> defining <T_2> , or being out <T_0> touch with reality . <T_3>
<T_3> are <T_0> many things <T_1> be happy <T_2> .
and according to <T_4> higgs <T_3> , at that instant , <T_1> dramatic <T_2> took place in the <T_0> .
<T_2> that we call minorities <T_3> are going to <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_5> second largest <T_4> , of <T_3> 30 <T_0> , is the one described <T_2> non-religious <T_1> secular .
<T_6> the <T_3> , this is a <T_7> star ; it &apos;s covered with <T_0> that the <T_4> at lucent <T_2> have <T_5> have no <T_1> whatsoever .
<T_8> is a <T_3> yorker , and <T_0> studio for many years was <T_2> chelsea , with <T_9> straight view <T_6> to the <T_5> trade center , and he <T_4> those <T_1> in <T_7> sort of light .
that &apos;s the only way <T_2> we <T_0> have done <T_1> .
<T_3> have <T_0> website , where the <T_2> all get their <T_1> .
so <T_1> will <T_0> the way <T_2> design things .
<T_2> know that <T_3> &apos;s not possible that this <T_1> could be mine , because of <T_4> timing of <T_0> .
<T_2> , <T_3> have to provide the fuel ; <T_5> , press the <T_1> pedal ; <T_4> , steer <T_0> car .
<T_3> then you <T_1> these things <T_2> you &apos;re happy or <T_0> .
we <T_2> events <T_5> emotions <T_1> instinctively transform <T_0> into a <T_4> that can be <T_3> understood .
and finally , there <T_2> a population of <T_1> that were <T_3> in <T_4> one-on-one <T_0> using a tutor .
<T_2> : grand-dad , <T_1> me the <T_0> please .
<T_2> they <T_0> look like <T_1> .
and <T_4> first mate <T_3> , &quot; <T_2> , i <T_1> at <T_5> point the rehearsal has <T_0> end . &quot;
technology has come of <T_2> that &apos;s allowing <T_6> to see <T_1> earth <T_4> space <T_5> go <T_3> into the <T_0> remotely .
<T_6> can <T_1> , &quot; sal <T_2> jason a headache , &quot; <T_4> it &apos;s a bit odd <T_0> say , &quot; sal <T_5> a headache <T_3> jason . &quot;
and <T_1> is about <T_0> most exciting thing in <T_3> life right now , which is <T_5> a <T_4> commentary <T_2> my <T_6> .
<T_5> success <T_0> be determined <T_4> your own fortitude , your <T_2> confidence , <T_3> own individual hard <T_1> .
why are <T_4> still thinking <T_3> the <T_0> of <T_5> do <T_2> apply <T_1> flu ? &quot;
he &apos;s got <T_3> on , reading the <T_5> , got <T_0> hat <T_4> , <T_1> , got <T_2> bag .
the <T_1> are out in <T_0> areas <T_2> the brain .
<T_3> we had <T_2> of those <T_1> surprises <T_0> science .
storyteller carmen <T_2> deedy spins <T_5> funny , wise <T_0> luminous tale of <T_1> and <T_6> , starring <T_4> cuban <T_7> . <T_8> in and <T_9> the <T_3> -- mama &apos;s driving !
<T_0> you get to <T_1> political <T_2> .
<T_2> symmetries and then of <T_1> the zeroth <T_0> where <T_4> just pick it up and leave it where it <T_3> .
<T_3> told <T_2> one of <T_1> colleagues , who <T_5> , &quot; well , what <T_4> your <T_0> do ? &quot;
the <T_0> out of the <T_1> lets <T_2> breathe .
we &apos;re going to <T_0> that <T_1> &quot; <T_2> . &quot;
but that <T_5> risk <T_8> , <T_7> all of the other risks <T_0> best <T_4> , <T_9> distributed <T_1> organized into local micro-grids <T_3> normally interconnect , but <T_6> stand <T_2> at need .
<T_1> was <T_0> concerned with <T_2> perception of what <T_6> was doing , that it exploded in my face , <T_5> to return <T_3> the ballroom <T_4> .
we &apos;re selling <T_1> billion cell <T_0> worldwide <T_2> year .
<T_3> then pointed out <T_7> there &apos;d be , <T_6> of , the <T_5> controls by <T_1> , <T_2> get rid of <T_4> that <T_0> stuff .
then <T_2> efficiency of such a <T_1> station is only <T_0> about <T_3> percent .
in <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;m certain <T_1> &apos;s not <T_3> .
thank <T_0> very <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;t you <T_1> it <T_4> something about <T_2> , &quot; <T_3> said .
<T_1> have <T_3> terrible scars on <T_2> legs from <T_4> i stabbed <T_0> .
so , i &apos;m going <T_1> challenge <T_0> of you .

then <T_0> said , &quot; do <T_1> have gaffer &apos;s tape ? &quot;
<T_1> question is , &quot; <T_2> that an <T_0> ? &quot;

if <T_8> really <T_2> to come <T_1> a point , we really <T_3> to put a cap on <T_9> carbon emission , we <T_5> to really lower the use of <T_0> -- <T_6> has to be <T_4> in <T_7> like india .
and <T_1> &apos;d really like <T_2> to happen a <T_0> faster than it is .
there <T_6> another <T_1> , <T_3> sort of towering piece of furniture with <T_5> and <T_4> and <T_0> -- pretty <T_2> stuff , when you &apos;re <T_8> little <T_7> .

<T_7> when <T_2> give them <T_8> euro <T_6> spend on their <T_4> , they do so much <T_9> on <T_3> teams that <T_5> actually get <T_1> huge win on investing this kind of <T_0> .
<T_1> , you know , i <T_0> reckless curiosity <T_3> be <T_4> the <T_2> needs now , <T_5> a <T_6> .
<T_0> now <T_1> don &apos;t , and <T_4> would be great <T_2> find <T_5> way to <T_6> communicate it , because <T_3> have not .
<T_5> within three <T_6> , <T_1> 2003 <T_2> 2006 , we were able to get <T_0> in place that actually changed the <T_4> of <T_3> fishers went about deep-sea bottom <T_7> .
<T_0> can tell <T_1> you &apos;re running into <T_2> in a <T_3> .
<T_2> the pain <T_3> not <T_1> problem : it &apos;s <T_0> symptom .
at the time i was just <T_8> to <T_4> from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go <T_7> being a boy to being this <T_0> girl <T_3> looked like <T_9> boy in girl &apos;s clothes to <T_5> opposite extreme of this <T_2> skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what <T_1> actually was , <T_6> tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
<T_1> i <T_7> him , &quot; let &apos;s find <T_2> way in which <T_0> &apos;ll be able <T_4> take out 10 kids <T_3> a <T_9> to <T_8> with <T_6> the summer in <T_5> country . &quot;
<T_2> &apos;m <T_1> creative <T_3> and <T_0> focus of my work <T_4> on public installations .
<T_3> user group <T_2> the <T_0> at the national <T_1> .
we &apos;re in <T_2> . <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> .
now <T_5> tasks being <T_4> are things <T_3> you <T_0> expect , like help with <T_2> chores <T_1> doing some supermarket <T_6> .
and <T_1> always had this <T_6> picture <T_9> even <T_7> they may have been one of <T_5> poorer <T_0> in the <T_4> , <T_2> were one <T_3> the most respected families <T_8> the village .
me was trying not <T_6> outcome of my violent <T_3> , <T_5> the separation that <T_8> <T_1> occurred between me and <T_7> body was <T_4> pretty significant <T_0> .
<T_0> : it <T_3> like <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> for bear here .
thank you . <T_8> , we would fill up with our own <T_1> and <T_7> own cortisol , <T_0> then we &apos;d <T_6> or be killed , we &apos;d eat <T_3> we &apos;d be <T_9> , and then suddenly we &apos;d de-fuel , and <T_4> &apos;d go back <T_2> normal . <T_5> .
<T_3> &apos;re looking at <T_5> on some <T_2> the most <T_1> resources of <T_0> : <T_4> .
so <T_3> &apos;re <T_5> these structures <T_6> start <T_2> the <T_1> of language <T_0> , and that &apos;s ongoing <T_4> now .
<T_0> inspected government <T_1> .
<T_0> we were doing open-heart <T_1> .
<T_7> empowers <T_8> people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in <T_4> community , and in doing so , to become better <T_9> of their <T_2> health . <T_5> , for <T_3> , task shifting is the ultimate example of <T_0> democratization of <T_1> knowledge , and therefore , medical <T_6> .
<T_4> like every <T_1> , <T_7> appreciated that <T_2> make her mark , what she <T_5> to <T_6> was find a <T_0> problem <T_3> solve it .
<T_2> might have been a <T_1> . it might have been <T_0> breakthrough .
our <T_3> seem <T_1> have awesome <T_0> over <T_2> destinies .
it <T_1> our <T_0> , and <T_5> us realize <T_3> are a part <T_6> nature <T_2> we &apos;re not separate <T_4> it .
and <T_2> &apos;d be wrong <T_0> dis <T_1> completely .
so i <T_1> to be very <T_0> .
so <T_3> got stuck at <T_2> $ 3.50-an-hour <T_0> , and <T_4> turned out to be <T_1> disaster .
<T_1> age of the <T_0> , <T_4> now <T_2> the big bang , <T_3> a hundred billion in <T_5> years .
<T_3> agriculture <T_0> work better if <T_1> are <T_5> to get <T_4> goods <T_2> market .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> passage -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> much <T_1> he said , anyway .
&quot; do <T_4> think <T_2> should &quot; — especially <T_5> you use loaded <T_3> -- &quot; <T_0> you think <T_7> government <T_1> provide <T_6> ? &quot;
<T_3> i want <T_4> talk to the <T_1> of those that have been doing it <T_0> more <T_2> two <T_5> .
and <T_6> interest in <T_9> mountain range , <T_8> earth scientists in those days , was <T_5> only because of its <T_0> size , dominating <T_3> planet , <T_1> the <T_4> it <T_7> in the <T_2> of the earth &apos;s outer skin .
<T_5> those skills <T_2> everything from <T_6> skills , <T_3> it &apos;s a technology <T_1> , <T_0> marketing , and <T_7> , and management , and <T_4> on .
<T_2> options , of course , <T_4> exactly <T_0> we need in <T_3> era of <T_1> .
<T_5> this <T_3> i &apos;m showing <T_2> the designers &apos; work , <T_4> they &apos;re the <T_0> that have <T_1> been stimulated .
<T_0> you .
i say , &quot; <T_1> &apos;s it possible <T_3> we could be <T_5> poor here in <T_4> united states , because the <T_0> is such <T_2> wealthy <T_6> , <T_8> &apos;s <T_7> much <T_9> ? &quot;
it <T_0> called the vaitarani .
there was lsd leaking <T_3> of kesey &apos;s veterans &apos; hospital experiments <T_0> other <T_4> around the <T_5> , <T_2> there was <T_6> literally <T_1> the <T_7> .
<T_0> gotta love that . rutgers .
<T_2> are <T_1> re-inventing the wheel <T_0> .
<T_2> turned out to be about <T_1> -- only <T_0> .
<T_0> should be <T_2> one-buttock <T_1> . &quot;
now , you <T_4> a <T_2> of power , and you got to beat <T_0> up -- <T_5> got a <T_3> of prestige , a lot of <T_1> .
now , researchers <T_1> to make every <T_6> to ensure <T_3> an <T_7> that has been shown to be beneficial <T_4> a clinical <T_9> is <T_0> to <T_8> participants of the trial <T_2> the trial has been <T_5> .
you <T_1> to realize <T_0> you can &apos;t fight <T_2> control this .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> moved house . <T_3> &apos;s got <T_0> friends .
if it comes up <T_2> , you lose <T_7> , you &apos;re fine , get to <T_3> the whole thing -- or <T_4> could play it <T_5> , <T_6> means you have to reach back <T_9> your wallet <T_8> give me five of those $ <T_1> bills , for <T_0> .
and <T_1> can take special <T_0> , <T_2> we can look at <T_3> .
<T_3> buy <T_6> of your <T_0> and <T_2> tell <T_5> of their friends , which leads <T_1> more <T_4> .
the <T_0> of these is <T_1> biophony .
some <T_2> may have built a <T_1> , fed <T_3> hungry <T_0> .
<T_5> i went <T_1> that <T_2> after getting my <T_4> , i basically <T_0> up <T_3> night .
their <T_1> became <T_2> of our collective <T_4> and , as <T_6> evolved into <T_7> shared sense of <T_5> , change <T_8> not <T_0> possible , but <T_3> .
what can <T_8> learn from the open-data <T_2> ? <T_0> this <T_5> talk , beth <T_7> , the former deputy <T_1> at the <T_3> house , <T_9> a vision of practical openness -- <T_4> bureaucracies to citizens , sharing data , creating a truly participatory democracy . imagine the &quot; writable <T_6> &quot; ...
you can <T_2> that <T_1> is <T_3> at night , <T_0> there .
and <T_2> found all sorts <T_3> molecules , they &apos;re called <T_4> or <T_5> , <T_0> respond to green <T_1> yellow <T_6> .
to <T_1> grandmother , <T_2> washing machine was <T_0> miracle .
celine <T_0> a housewife and <T_2> in <T_1> rural <T_4> of cameroon in <T_3> central africa .
<T_2> wanted to create <T_0> that moved and morphed <T_1> an <T_3> .
<T_6> each <T_7> of them are <T_0> in <T_2> chosen field , <T_1> confidence , restoring <T_4> , and <T_3> hopes in <T_5> own lives .
and this <T_0> wool over here .
i don &apos;t <T_0> with <T_1> in any kind of traumatic <T_2> .
and he <T_2> three <T_5> , which are &quot; focal <T_1> , &quot; &quot; <T_6> luminescence &quot; <T_7> &quot; play of the brilliants &quot; -- three very <T_8> different ideas about light <T_9> architecture that <T_3> together make <T_0> this <T_4> experience .
epidemiology <T_1> the <T_5> of how we know in the <T_0> world if <T_2> is good for you <T_4> bad <T_3> you .
you see , the <T_7> between <T_4> and illusion <T_1> the <T_6> between <T_0> things <T_5> seem to us and <T_2> they really <T_3> .
&quot; <T_0> you even <T_1> ? &quot;
now , design thinking begins <T_1> what roger <T_2> , <T_6> business school <T_0> at <T_4> university <T_3> toronto , calls integrative <T_5> .
just scuttle <T_1> and go for <T_0> . &quot;
so , i <T_4> , &quot; <T_5> well <T_2> can &apos;t <T_0> that . then we <T_1> do <T_3> harder . &quot;
is <T_0> produced by man &apos;s activities causing <T_2> planet to <T_1> up ?
<T_2> has got to be <T_0> pre-competitive <T_1> .
no , the guy says , &quot; <T_8> &apos;re going to <T_4> a guy into this <T_3> room , and wearing the <T_7> you &apos;re <T_5> to give us , he <T_2> she is <T_1> to pick up a <T_6> or a <T_0> off this <T_9> .
<T_6> takes <T_0> base metal of <T_7> conventional wisdom and transforms it <T_1> ridicule into <T_2> different <T_4> of <T_3> and ultimately being <T_5> the <T_8> .
these are survival skills <T_0> we inherited over many , <T_3> hundreds of thousands <T_2> years <T_1> evolution .
welcome <T_0> the new <T_1> .
<T_4> didn &apos;t please <T_0> . <T_3> then a funny <T_2> happened in <T_1> conversation .
the <T_0> one looks likes <T_1> : <T_4> we live <T_3> a three-dimensional <T_2> .
how <T_0> ?
what did <T_1> do with <T_0> 3 <T_3> dollars in <T_2> ?
<T_4> we won &apos;t give the <T_5> of the <T_2> , <T_3> we will give <T_0> three <T_1> .
<T_2> they <T_3> nice <T_1> somebody . i <T_0> be them . &quot;
i was with <T_6> brother <T_0> a <T_9> having a <T_7> beers , and i was watching the world <T_2> by , had <T_3> few more beers , and the conversation turned <T_1> &apos; 70s fashion — <T_5> and how everything manages to come <T_4> into <T_8> .
<T_0> , <T_1> want to ask a <T_2> .
<T_2> this <T_3> , this <T_0> a <T_1> from a 15th-century <T_4> .
who <T_1> ? does <T_2> justify what <T_3> local <T_0> goes through ?
<T_2> basically we <T_1> inoculate people <T_0> the common <T_3> .
water from <T_4> sea forms <T_2> that return to the <T_1> and <T_8> seas as <T_9> , <T_5> and <T_7> , and provides home <T_6> about 97 percent of life <T_0> the world , maybe in <T_3> universe .
and the <T_6> , for <T_2> , serving as a <T_5> for <T_0> seat as <T_1> as a <T_3> part of the <T_4> rigidity .
by <T_0> their <T_5> smiles , researchers were able to <T_3> how fulfilling <T_7> long-lasting a subject &apos;s marriage will be , <T_1> well <T_4> would score <T_6> standardized tests of well-being <T_2> how <T_9> she would be <T_8> others .
and <T_0> , <T_3> and a half years <T_1> , guess <T_2> ?
here &apos;s <T_4> guy : &quot; <T_3> are many <T_1> in <T_5> at the <T_0> time who feel keenly <T_2> .
it &apos;s <T_0> sensible <T_1> of <T_2> address .
<T_0> do we <T_2> to <T_3> what china <T_1> ?
<T_3> &apos;s on <T_1> , <T_2> supplies are <T_5> , <T_7> you <T_4> have to go up <T_0> go down , make that <T_6> very <T_8> .
so <T_1> keenan , just any <T_6> you &apos;re -- all <T_9> -- <T_7> to let her go . <T_4> first , we &apos;re going to make <T_3> that it &apos;s appearing on <T_2> screen , <T_8> you <T_0> what it <T_5> .
<T_6> &apos;s a <T_2> a <T_3> made . <T_1> put on it the water plant , and which <T_0> are there , <T_5> houses have been connected <T_4> the water .
<T_1> on <T_2> are you crocheting a <T_0> ?
india is <T_2> . <T_6> first <T_1> countries coming <T_4> the western <T_3> , and we get a <T_0> a new <T_5> .
<T_1> was <T_0> lbs .
actually , one indication <T_3> that <T_2> boy <T_4> my husband &apos;s <T_1> has <T_5> graduated from <T_0> school .
so <T_4> have this <T_1> last <T_3> of the <T_7> , the <T_2> , <T_5> is <T_0> a cartoon of a facade of a <T_6> .
together , may <T_0> journey well .
<T_2> need <T_4> kind of moral leadership <T_3> courage <T_0> our <T_1> .
now <T_1> is still <T_0> big problem , in my <T_2> .
<T_4> get <T_5> mtdna <T_7> your mother , and your <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> , all the way <T_1> to <T_6> very first <T_3> .
<T_1> can <T_0> ; black <T_4> ski ; <T_5> men <T_2> strong buildings ; we <T_3> strong suns .
but <T_2> 1991 through the <T_8> time , emphasized <T_7> the <T_3> of 2001 , <T_9> idea of <T_6> all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea <T_0> a single <T_4> , act of nuclear terrorism is <T_5> we have <T_1> .
<T_5> an <T_6> of the oceans <T_4> 4,000 meters , in fact , the <T_0> seas covers and provides <T_7> <T_3> percent of the <T_2> for life on <T_1> earth .
this <T_1> up being the lead <T_4> in the <T_0> fishery story <T_2> national <T_3> .
so <T_0> &apos;m <T_1> .
now investment <T_0> only about <T_3> fifth of the <T_2> income <T_7> most modern <T_1> , <T_5> it plays <T_6> absolutely vital <T_4> .
<T_8> in schools we owe it to <T_0> to make sure <T_9> 180 <T_1> of the <T_4> , <T_2> that little precious age of four , til <T_3> , 20 , 24 , <T_5> , they need to be cooked proper , fresh food <T_6> local growers on site . <T_7> ?
<T_2> phrase &apos; <T_4> is <T_8> &apos; expresses <T_3> current <T_7> that surrounds art-making -- a <T_0> of &apos; it <T_5> &apos;t what <T_6> do , it &apos;s the way that <T_1> do it &apos; notion .
imagine <T_3> politicians <T_2> dance to explain <T_4> we must <T_1> a <T_0> country <T_6> bail out an investment <T_5> .
<T_0> was lucky ; i had <T_2> about <T_6> for <T_4> , <T_1> i <T_5> met him earlier this <T_3> at his museum <T_7> chengdu .
so does <T_5> this <T_4> ? or <T_6> globaloney <T_7> a <T_2> way <T_0> getting people to pay <T_1> attention to globalization-related <T_3> ?
and this <T_3> him up , <T_1> his courage is <T_0> to rise to the <T_2> .
and <T_2> they &apos;re the most <T_1> element <T_0> all .
<T_2> by this , i <T_9> looking at what <T_7> of people have done and carefully <T_0> the <T_4> , <T_5> nature , the <T_6> , the <T_1> of rewards in games to keep them engaged <T_8> staggering <T_3> of time and effort .
and <T_0> were just <T_4> every finger , <T_2> that <T_3> balloon <T_1> hold together , <T_6> , fortunately , it <T_5> .
<T_1> we &apos;re once again <T_2> &quot; <T_0> one , get <T_3> . &quot;
<T_2> are coated . <T_1> fractures <T_3> coated <T_0> organic materials .
it &apos;s just because <T_8> are uncomfortable with <T_3> idea , and that &apos;s why i <T_2> you <T_9> to try to <T_7> about this , think <T_0> the <T_5> of bees in <T_6> and why <T_1> really are a terrific <T_4> .
because <T_0> if <T_2> or <T_4> of the non-immune <T_1> gets infected , there &apos;s <T_5> one <T_3> them to <T_6> .
<T_0> do <T_1> know when we &apos;re <T_5> at something <T_3> it &apos;s <T_2> or <T_4> ?
we <T_1> &apos;t live <T_0> eat <T_2> make money .
<T_3> the <T_0> is : <T_2> yet , they &apos;re <T_1> .
for <T_2> of <T_1> , the <T_0> evolved completely <T_3> notice .
<T_0> it uncurl <T_2> then peel these <T_1> .
<T_1> is this how <T_0> is going to disappear ?
and they kept on using <T_2> existing <T_0> that <T_3> had on <T_1> two-year-olds and up .
<T_3> , <T_2> lot of people <T_5> up <T_7> to share the <T_6> , and the <T_1> who were there <T_0> got concerned enough to bring out <T_4> lawyers .
so <T_6> put the <T_0> a little more <T_5> , let &apos;s ask <T_4> what are the <T_2> requirements <T_8> what you just <T_3> , <T_7> spontaneous <T_1> .
<T_9> these people that had sort of <T_4> daily hours <T_7> an interest <T_6> the <T_2> word -- <T_0> hope to have an interest <T_5> the english <T_8> , <T_1> i &apos;m not <T_3> it well right now .
and <T_0> the <T_5> question <T_6> came to <T_4> was , <T_3> , <T_1> fast does <T_2> limb move ?
<T_0> &apos;s <T_4> little voice <T_1> your <T_7> that &apos;s <T_2> and <T_3> , &quot; <T_5> &apos;s good . that &apos;s <T_6> . &quot;
<T_8> in <T_4> school , i was <T_3> by <T_9> stories of <T_1> allied <T_2> -- soldiers who left <T_0> safety of their own homes <T_6> risked their lives to <T_5> a country <T_7> a people that they didn &apos;t know .
<T_3> i <T_1> him : &quot; when are you <T_2> to <T_0> it ?
<T_5> may teach <T_3> whatever creed <T_9> think is most important , <T_8> i say <T_0> have a <T_7> to let them be <T_2> about <T_1> the other <T_6> in the <T_4> , too .
and <T_0> disappeared .
<T_0> learn much <T_1> .
<T_3> may seem <T_5> , but <T_6> is terrifying to hear rumor after <T_2> after rumor that <T_0> tidal wave , <T_1> than the <T_8> , will be coming <T_9> exactly 1 p.m. , <T_4> perhaps tonight , <T_7> perhaps ...
the <T_0> wagged <T_1> tongue back .
<T_6> the <T_0> is <T_3> some new <T_2> which i want to <T_5> to , <T_7> has <T_4> quite happened in <T_1> way it &apos;s happening now .
30,000 <T_2> for a night <T_1> a <T_0> .
and <T_2> person <T_0> particularly <T_1> .
<T_1> : i <T_0> you <T_3> &apos;d have the last <T_2> .
<T_8> is <T_5> galaxy , fully <T_9> ours <T_6> andromeda , which looks <T_2> small and <T_4> because <T_0> light has taken 10 <T_7> light-years to <T_1> to <T_3> .
so <T_2> economic <T_5> made a <T_0> people <T_4> , it <T_1> many more <T_3> off .
but there are <T_6> truths <T_0> to every <T_4> , <T_3> on <T_7> creator &apos;s <T_1> , <T_5> viewer and the context <T_2> which <T_8> is presented .
<T_3> , at <T_2> level , in what &apos;s called the <T_6> cortex , <T_5> are <T_0> visual images , or <T_1> or <T_4> .
they &apos;ve eaten <T_1> . <T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> together .
so , <T_1> is <T_2> long history <T_0> stop signs <T_3> yield signs .
he <T_2> to go out <T_1> do an <T_0> .
i <T_0> , now we &apos;re <T_1> about 100 <T_2> .
<T_9> have to go <T_7> what <T_0> essentially an <T_3> model of <T_6> , <T_2> manufacturing model , <T_5> is <T_1> on linearity and <T_4> and <T_8> people .
<T_4> saw the food <T_6> in <T_2> , <T_7> what i call <T_3> silent <T_1> of <T_5> the globe when food prices <T_0> overnight .
<T_3> the <T_1> that &apos;s so <T_0> about <T_4> species is that <T_7> &apos;re really <T_2> to <T_5> through our <T_6> lifetime .
and <T_9> more of the <T_7> comes into view using <T_3> machines <T_2> the large hadron <T_5> , we <T_8> be <T_4> to <T_6> whether nature <T_0> this e8 pattern <T_1> a different one .
<T_7> friend of mine sent me <T_0> called a hip-hop <T_4> , where the twenty-third psalm is rendered <T_6> , &quot; the lord <T_2> all that , &quot; <T_5> opposed <T_3> what i <T_9> it as , &quot; the <T_8> is <T_1> shepherd . &quot;
the <T_2> powering the <T_3> in this <T_0> was <T_1> just moments <T_4> .
<T_4> couldn &apos;t <T_5> it , and <T_2> &apos;d go around dissecting <T_3> little <T_0> out <T_6> making photographs <T_1> them .
<T_1> have <T_0> big problem .
<T_2> skiing along that <T_5> trip , <T_7> had two imaginary <T_3> clips that i &apos;d replay over and over <T_8> in my <T_6> when the going <T_1> tough , just to <T_4> my <T_0> going .
so this <T_3> a picture of the <T_0> archive <T_2> the <T_1> of <T_4> .
so <T_3> smith <T_4> clyde <T_2> developed some new methods <T_0> making error-free dna <T_1> a small <T_5> .
<T_9> had <T_0> mothers , our <T_6> , <T_3> cousins , <T_1> sisters , and of course , the ever-present <T_8> bombarding us <T_4> images <T_2> words , telling <T_7> how <T_5> be .

<T_8> of all , <T_7> good <T_4> it ? <T_2> , it &apos;s pretty good . it <T_9> &apos;t <T_3> , but it &apos;s much , much better <T_0> you <T_6> expect , <T_1> our completely <T_5> model .
<T_2> : ... <T_1> a <T_0> grant .
we are today <T_0> about moral <T_1> .

now this is what many <T_3> do , and it &apos;s our <T_6> for <T_0> , <T_5> it is also <T_1> colleagues &apos; <T_4> and <T_2> communities &apos; loss .
<T_2> is where it &apos;s really <T_1> to <T_0> lives .
so , children are <T_0> empty <T_1> , <T_2> ?
<T_6> then in the midst <T_0> all <T_1> came <T_4> new <T_3> for thinking about what <T_5> meant to be <T_2> .
<T_1> sister <T_0> different .
it &apos;s <T_2> inherent <T_0> of an evolutionary <T_1> .

<T_1> i mean , why <T_2> they respond to <T_0> 14-year-old , anyway ?
<T_0> of this is <T_3> , <T_2> we each <T_4> to <T_1> fight .
it you &apos;re <T_1> , that <T_0> drops to <T_2> .

we <T_1> things <T_0> .
<T_2> to explain <T_1> this is <T_0> , i have <T_3> question .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_3> obvious , <T_0> &apos;re coming from <T_1> .
twenty-four <T_4> ago , i had -- a sophomore <T_2> college , i had a series of <T_1> . no alcohol <T_3> <T_0> .
well <T_1> turns out it &apos;s not <T_9> old-timey <T_8> scientists who are this <T_6> . <T_3> recently got a chance to <T_2> to richard <T_4> for a documentary , <T_5> i was able to disgust <T_0> a <T_7> of times . here &apos;s my favorite .
<T_2> know what the wind <T_0> are . <T_1> can cover <T_3> percent .
<T_0> then <T_2> years from now , billions will <T_5> have gone into <T_1> , <T_3> we would <T_6> have the same <T_4> .
we <T_1> that <T_0> are available <T_2> .
the pieces <T_4> and disappear , <T_9> maybe more <T_0> -- this <T_2> just looking north <T_7> the center of the installation -- they create a <T_5> , a field that <T_6> living and the surrogate bodies <T_1> a kind of relation , a relation with <T_3> other and a relation with <T_8> limit , the edge , the horizon .
<T_1> if you see the <T_4> &quot; <T_2> , &quot; <T_0> people think <T_3> .
we used <T_3> think this <T_6> a <T_1> human <T_7> , <T_0> we learned that the great <T_5> , our <T_4> relatives , <T_2> show this ability .
so <T_3> is <T_0> good thing <T_2> the cfo , <T_1> just <T_4> sustainability guy .
maybe we <T_0> make <T_1> .
<T_3> if some of <T_2> fundamental ideas <T_0> obesity are just <T_1> ?
<T_1> san franciscans thought <T_0> had to do <T_2> same as well .
we <T_1> get out of our <T_3> ghetto and go visit <T_0> next one and <T_2> next .
<T_3> you <T_2> &apos;t think that way , well , you <T_4> a lot of <T_7> in <T_0> history of western <T_9> , because <T_5> tidy <T_1> , you <T_6> , <T_8> criticized it .

<T_3> of this <T_5> the fact <T_1> throughout this period , there &apos;s <T_4> supercomputer <T_2> in the <T_0> -- seti <T_6> home .
and all of a sudden , indian <T_0> had <T_7> to the reality <T_3> you can source <T_6> best <T_2> for <T_4> best <T_5> anywhere <T_1> the <T_8> .
he had <T_4> in <T_9> abilities <T_0> a cartoonist , even <T_7> he had no <T_3> evidence <T_1> i was any <T_5> whatsoever : <T_6> he saw was <T_2> a <T_8> .
in <T_1> , <T_5> the <T_4> that i gathered <T_3> , only <T_0> experience came close to being the <T_2> one .
<T_6> &apos;s <T_3> focus of <T_1> field research , <T_0> centers that we &apos;ve set <T_2> all over the <T_7> -- <T_4> of them , top population <T_5> .
<T_6> &apos;s not easy <T_1> one-up the greeks . but with <T_9> industriousness of the egyptians , <T_8> were <T_0> to <T_4> the library of alexandria -- <T_7> idea of <T_3> copy of every book of all the <T_2> of the <T_5> .

<T_3> laboratories <T_2> i <T_1> up in bellingham , <T_0> .
<T_0> what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species , take account of the soil , that <T_2> with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because <T_7> is no <T_1> involved here except for those fences , <T_4> are <T_5> cheap they could <T_3> all over africa <T_8> no time -- that we can take the food we need from <T_9> earth and actually heal <T_6> earth in the process .
<T_2> how <T_0> you make it <T_1> ?
<T_4> that &apos;s how <T_2> use the food lure <T_6> the <T_1> , <T_0> we <T_3> food because we &apos;re dealing <T_5> owners .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 <T_4> , and <T_1> that <T_9> i &apos;ve <T_3> the ability , the commitment , the <T_5> of <T_8> to do <T_7> decline , <T_0> i don &apos;t see them <T_6> a comeback <T_2> now .
so <T_2> is <T_1> everett middle <T_3> writers &apos; room , where <T_4> decorated it in <T_0> style .
we &apos;re showing <T_5> new <T_1> by just <T_2> images because <T_0> &apos;s how <T_3> world <T_4> us .
<T_6> i <T_2> as long as <T_0> keep grieving , <T_1> weeping , <T_4> then moving <T_3> , <T_5> &apos;m fine .

you &apos;re <T_3> snippets <T_1> &quot; sputnik , &quot; my <T_2> documentary feature , <T_4> is just about <T_0> .
and so very <T_4> you can <T_1> a bunch of <T_2> , <T_7> it makes <T_5> more <T_0> for <T_6> to link to you <T_8> the future , and then <T_9> get this kind of <T_3> .
<T_1> worked well this <T_0> ?
but i have to say that <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> technologies <T_3> i tend to <T_1> .
then there was similar <T_0> in &apos; 97- &apos; <T_1> .
<T_0> , <T_1> very .
i <T_3> here <T_0> there , but <T_2> my condition <T_1> , so <T_4> my <T_5> .

and <T_4> was <T_0> 40 <T_6> owner of <T_2> dotcom that was <T_3> to go <T_1> and no doubt be <T_5> billions <T_7> .
we miss <T_0> .
<T_1> simple <T_0> .
in fact , when <T_1> go back to <T_6> beginning , there <T_7> no private investors who would be <T_0> to take a risk on building a new <T_2> for a <T_3> class that made under a <T_8> a day , that were <T_9> to be some of the most risk-averse people on <T_5> planet and that were working in <T_4> of the riskiest sectors , agriculture .
<T_2> that &apos;s selling their excess eggs at the <T_1> gate , perfectly legally , to their <T_9> , we &apos;ve stuck on there . we started with four , and we &apos;ve now got 64 on , and the result of that was that <T_0> were then going into shops <T_7> for a local todmorden egg , and the result of that was , <T_8> farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds , and then they went on to meat birds , and although these are really , really small steps , that <T_6> local <T_4> confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways , and we now have farmers doing cheese and they &apos;ve upped <T_3> flocks and rare breed pigs , they &apos;re doing pasties and pies and things <T_5> they would have never done before .

<T_8> with the <T_5> for <T_3> from sight loss <T_4> learning to <T_7> on all <T_0> non-visual <T_6> , things that <T_2> would otherwise <T_1> ignore .
now , <T_0> by man for all of <T_1> history . <T_2>
the <T_0> used in <T_2> books <T_4> the <T_3> of <T_1> .
in 1981 , it flew <T_3> miles from paris <T_4> england , solely <T_1> the power of <T_5> , <T_0> established <T_7> basis <T_2> the <T_6> .
he <T_6> some early <T_0> , <T_7> late in his <T_1> , in <T_3> mature <T_8> , he said , &quot; <T_2> &apos;s a <T_4> -- 30 <T_5> . &quot;
getting <T_3> school , for <T_1> kid that <T_6> actually <T_0> short for his age , through <T_5> canadian winter , was <T_4> a <T_2> experience .
<T_2> lives <T_1> sharing <T_3> , at least <T_0> part .
<T_1> actually don &apos;t come <T_2> of your <T_0> .
<T_4> about seemingly <T_5> and visceral <T_2> like <T_0> you &apos;re <T_8> to , you will start <T_1> the beliefs of the people <T_7> you <T_3> even realizing that that &apos;s what <T_6> &apos;re <T_9> .
we <T_1> perception , <T_0> and non-visual <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;d <T_1> to think it is , but we know it isn &apos;t .
we were <T_1> the <T_4> , in <T_0> rum , in <T_3> small <T_2> .
and <T_0> is a 100 billion <T_2> per <T_1> .
<T_4> we do <T_1> we <T_0> our kids all the <T_3> they <T_2> &apos;t do : don &apos;t <T_5> ; don &apos;t <T_6> ; don &apos;t swear .
since <T_3> live on a <T_0> on <T_1> running <T_4> of <T_5> union , this <T_2> perfect sense <T_6> me .
<T_0> then some cheery <T_1> usually <T_2> pipes <T_6> and <T_4> , &quot; <T_3> , don &apos;t forget about <T_5> . &quot;
and there <T_2> an <T_1> between diplomacy <T_3> the <T_0> coming bottom-up .
<T_6> dan <T_5> , the author <T_4> predictably irrational , uses classic visual illusions <T_9> <T_2> own counterintuitive <T_0> findings to show <T_1> we &apos;re not as rational as <T_7> think <T_8> <T_3> make decisions .
so , now i <T_1> to show <T_2> very well might be the <T_0> living thing on <T_3> planet .
<T_3> am an example <T_5> what &apos;s possible <T_7> girls <T_1> the very beginning of <T_0> lives are loved <T_6> nurtured <T_2> the <T_8> around <T_4> .
mirror neurons <T_1> imitation , <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ll come back after <T_0> months .
and <T_4> what <T_1> get then from <T_3> pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human <T_2> to recapture <T_0> tag .
<T_0> this <T_1> happens .
the <T_5> of it all comes <T_7> the <T_3> , organically , <T_2> if <T_6> get five great <T_0> of great , organic stuff <T_4> your <T_1> , in your film , your film , audiences <T_8> get <T_9> .
let &apos;s <T_4> the <T_2> devil from being <T_0> first <T_3> to go extinct <T_1> cancer .
but <T_3> academicians <T_2> &apos;t <T_1> anything that he <T_0> .
and i <T_0> , <T_2> , <T_3> can make <T_1> relationships with <T_4> other .
now the reason <T_4> know <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> is that <T_0> corals have growth <T_2> .
self-consciousness is <T_0> enemy of <T_1> .
and <T_1> of the issues <T_0> capacity .
we &apos;re <T_2> at <T_1> moment when another <T_4> of <T_3> are <T_5> a cruel <T_0> market .
and so <T_2> getting us <T_5> mow the <T_7> , we keep the <T_1> from coming <T_3> , which <T_6> new england happens <T_4> , <T_0> quickly .
&quot; <T_4> attract <T_2> writers : operators <T_3> sites <T_1> mydamnchannel.com <T_5> benefit from <T_0> disputes . &quot;
so <T_1> ear bender <T_4> puts something out <T_6> so someone can grab <T_2> ear and <T_0> what <T_3> have to <T_5> .
the other <T_1> thing <T_2> you <T_0> memory .
<T_8> on the <T_1> day of <T_5> to <T_3> , you get <T_0> assignment of , <T_2> a <T_4> and make <T_9> look like what it <T_7> it is . so that &apos;s type <T_6> , right ?
<T_5> &apos;m trying to build a <T_3> team , <T_4> will look at <T_1> global <T_0> challenges <T_6> the world is <T_2> .
<T_3> has to be <T_0> much a part <T_2> them <T_1> they really <T_4> it .
<T_2> for them <T_0> really a work in <T_1> .
<T_0> size of that <T_5> , for <T_2> , is really <T_3> technology in a <T_4> we &apos;re <T_1> going to go <T_6> to .
<T_1> the cardiac side , <T_5> are <T_2> smaller and much <T_3> to place <T_6> you don &apos;t need to train an <T_0> cardiologist <T_4> place them .
well , the <T_1> is , is someone still wearing <T_0> knee <T_3> months <T_2> ?
c : this is <T_0> gun .
when asked <T_0> a <T_1> , &quot; how <T_3> so <T_2> ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s tens of <T_2> of calculations just to design <T_3> connection <T_0> a piece of structural steel and <T_4> piece <T_1> structural steel .
so in my case , i <T_0> , well , will <T_2> and <T_4> algorithm lead <T_1> to <T_3> prince <T_5> ?
so <T_1> said , &quot; <T_2> , <T_5> can play a game , &quot; and i give <T_8> a bunch of these , and <T_4> tell <T_6> to <T_3> them in different families . <T_9> are <T_7> of maezza <T_0> she was — god , it still chokes me up seeing these .
first , <T_3> predicts <T_0> will take the <T_2> that &apos;s <T_1> his .
now i <T_1> back to the <T_2> of the new <T_3> enterprise <T_4> i &apos;m <T_0> .
and <T_0> she is -- <T_1> .
we <T_2> this <T_1> , <T_0> it &apos;s not a <T_3> yet .
<T_0> , a <T_3> turns <T_4> an <T_2> when it hits <T_1> surface .
<T_3> then we <T_0> on <T_2> they &apos;re going <T_1> get paid .
the <T_1> remanufactured <T_2> hydrocarbons into <T_3> -- <T_0> sugars .
<T_1> was five foot two , <T_3> feisty <T_0> very <T_2> .
he spelled moriarty <T_1> only <T_2> &apos; <T_0> &apos; .
<T_8> &apos;s not having <T_2> that make <T_1> wise , it &apos;s reflecting <T_9> the <T_7> that <T_6> &apos;ve had that makes <T_3> wise -- and <T_4> helps us become whole , <T_0> wisdom <T_5> authenticity .
<T_1> , i get to put in <T_3> of the things <T_0> i <T_2> .
you <T_2> , <T_5> have <T_3> ldl level of 140 <T_0> a <T_1> aged <T_4> .
this <T_9> told <T_8> , you know , you gotta watch the guys , <T_4> you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk , because getting on <T_5> by a <T_1> is just <T_7> good , and <T_6> our <T_3> we need to <T_0> out , is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing <T_2> everything ?
<T_2> , six and a <T_4> years <T_6> , over <T_3> million <T_5> are using <T_0> , <T_7> over 700,000 posts <T_1> day .
the third thing i <T_4> you to remember is that even though <T_0> &apos;re more comfortable with this idea of &quot; them , &quot; a set of bad guys <T_1> from us , <T_6> are actually accomplices to them , either <T_5> our direct <T_3> or through <T_9> acceptance of the inconsistency between <T_7> policies of prohibition and <T_8> actual behavior of tolerance or <T_2> encouragement of consumption .
<T_1> it is going <T_5> . <T_2> there , down <T_6> other side , and <T_0> get the same <T_4> of <T_3> .
languages <T_0> genes <T_1> , getting things <T_2> they <T_3> .
<T_6> now <T_0> have a way <T_5> of the really <T_3> things , though , is <T_8> that <T_2> of the trip that i <T_7> <T_1> ghana just last month <T_4>
seventy-five percent of <T_0> are <T_2> and <T_1> .
at <T_1> , they &apos;re <T_0> , they &apos;re for <T_2> .
this is a <T_1> which gets <T_0> vilified throughout the pentagon .
and when <T_2> was done , the <T_1> said to <T_3> with <T_5> awe , &quot; <T_4> have never been <T_0> like this before . &quot;
ok , the <T_0> population .
what are we <T_0> ?
so <T_1> have <T_0> prototypes .
<T_2> that the &quot; world <T_0> news &quot; makes <T_1> up ?
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> the idea .
<T_0> &apos;d like <T_1> to come in and <T_2> .
so <T_1> &apos;m going to briefly discuss a <T_3> of problems <T_2> we have <T_4> a <T_0> of problems <T_7> we &apos;ve <T_6> some solutions <T_5> .
the fact is , is that the <T_8> museum had a complete specimen of a <T_9> in <T_6> collection up <T_3> the 18th century -- it was actually mummified , skin and all -- but <T_1> a <T_5> of space-saving zeal , they actually cut off <T_7> head <T_2> they cut off the feet and they burned the <T_4> in a <T_0> .
so here is what we <T_2> : 8,000 gallons of <T_0> equivalent to build <T_1> house .
and in fact , the large <T_0> , <T_1> governments , <T_3> &apos;t take the <T_2> .
<T_0> little rarer <T_2> the fallstreak holes . <T_1> right ?
<T_0> . okay <T_1> &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> , <T_2> .
<T_6> lipson demonstrates a <T_0> of his <T_1> little <T_4> , which have <T_3> ability to <T_5> , <T_2> themselves and <T_7> self-replicate .
your <T_2> comes up <T_1> your <T_0> .
<T_0> it &apos;s an enormous <T_1> of <T_2> .
i &apos;m sitting <T_2> cambridge , <T_3> at <T_0> healthcare <T_1> conference .
<T_4> up those <T_1> plates with <T_0> and <T_5> open up the very <T_7> bottle of <T_2> you <T_3> , light the candles <T_6> celebrate <T_8> .
<T_0> are <T_4> that <T_3> and <T_2> will never <T_1> anything .
that &apos;s where <T_1> got <T_3> with <T_2> maslow &apos;s &quot; hierarchy of <T_0> . &quot;
how i <T_0> the <T_1> of <T_2> is <T_6> period of transnational <T_5> , where <T_3> is defined more so <T_7> ideas <T_4> narratives .
now <T_1> of the <T_4> i can eventually earn for my ufo <T_2> a <T_0> that i <T_3> drop down .
and <T_1> you think <T_3> that way , <T_5> become more sensitive <T_0> the human considerations , <T_2> are crucial <T_6> making ethical <T_4> .
the <T_7> is in the worst possible position <T_8> the actual <T_9> , because they &apos;re hearing <T_1> contact of the <T_0> on <T_3> drum , <T_5> the <T_2> on the bit of wood , or the <T_6> on the string , <T_4> . , or the breath that &apos;s creating the sound from wind and brass .
trial or no trial , these <T_1> are <T_0> and center <T_2> their <T_3> right <T_5> to a <T_4> of a <T_6> .
music is <T_3> most powerful <T_4> of <T_0> that we <T_1> that affects <T_2> emotional <T_5> .
<T_7> , after <T_0> 80 <T_3> of having sound , <T_8> thought <T_4> was about time <T_5> we figure out <T_2> way to put sound <T_6> you <T_1> to .
so <T_9> want <T_5> isolate this , because <T_4> was <T_0> great <T_7> -- 30 <T_2> ago , right , <T_6> years <T_8> -- and it &apos;s one <T_3> &apos;s laid fallow <T_1> research .
<T_4> 1,000 <T_1> of water fell <T_2> every <T_0> of that <T_3> that day .
<T_1> watch them move <T_3> a <T_0> i &apos;m never going to get <T_2> of .
<T_2> repeatedly : <T_0> , again , <T_1> , the same <T_3> .
she <T_2> , &quot; would <T_1> put them to <T_0> ? &quot;
so all in all , <T_1> has <T_0> of benefits .
my <T_6> today is <T_5> what <T_1> messages <T_3> if <T_8> do want to stay in the <T_0> , <T_4> i <T_2> there <T_7> three .
and then <T_3> child turned <T_1> , and i <T_4> using <T_5> cheap and easy treatment , and <T_2> wonder &quot; -- <T_6> she wondered , like <T_7> parents <T_8> lose children wonder -- &quot; if there isn &apos;t <T_9> that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive <T_0> . &quot;
<T_0> to <T_5> that , it involves <T_1> of temperature , extremes of <T_2> and <T_3> of <T_4> .
<T_9> i &apos;m going to offer quickly <T_6> more <T_2> that will be useful <T_3> organizing your education <T_5> career , or <T_7> you &apos;re teaching , how you might <T_8> your own <T_0> and <T_4> of young <T_1> .
i <T_2> about <T_5> little girl who <T_7> &apos;t stop <T_4> on <T_3> because so many <T_1> soldiers had shoved <T_0> inside <T_6> .
<T_1> life in our country <T_2> , to <T_5> the <T_4> , <T_3> extraordinary , <T_0> circumstances .
you can look at <T_5> , and <T_3> , and <T_0> it <T_2> on <T_1> runway , or <T_4> .
and <T_0> insane <T_4> does <T_1> know what an impossible <T_2> is . &quot; <T_3> you .
so , you <T_2> come up with a set of <T_1> that when they <T_4> together , form <T_3> little binary <T_0> rather than <T_5> checkerboard .
<T_7> are things <T_0> describe beauty in a <T_9> that is often <T_6> accessible if you <T_3> the <T_2> and the <T_8> of the person who studies <T_4> subject <T_5> which <T_1> and beauty is expressed .
<T_1> was i supposed <T_0> live it ?
people <T_3> tried for a <T_0> time . <T_1> are a <T_2> of interesting <T_4> .
a <T_2> of <T_3> have gotten <T_1> phillips <T_0> life .
now the astonishing thing <T_3> , if you have <T_4> in your phantom limb , you <T_0> the <T_7> person &apos;s hand , massage <T_8> other person &apos;s hand , that relieves <T_5> pain in <T_1> phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining <T_6> from <T_9> watching <T_2> else being massaged .
<T_2> i said , &quot; well , you <T_6> , you &apos;re all in this <T_5> . <T_1> teach : <T_8> &apos;s <T_7> , &quot; <T_4> all <T_3> could think of . what is <T_0> ?
ak : we <T_6> work on the <T_2> after <T_4> model was <T_1> , and <T_7> prototype <T_3> a bit <T_0> than we <T_5> .
when <T_0> conquistadors arrived in <T_1> you had <T_3> choices <T_2> you either fight back and engage or you could take <T_4> .
so you &apos;re going to be in <T_0> , you &apos;re going to be <T_2> control , you &apos;re <T_1> to be in <T_3> driver &apos;s <T_4> .
<T_4> if mother <T_8> has given <T_5> some <T_2> , <T_6> think that <T_1> might be a <T_3> future <T_7> the value of how we <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> one <T_1> .
and they <T_2> that <T_6> , and that knocks <T_5> coins <T_0> the slot , <T_3> when <T_1> happens , <T_7> get a <T_4> .
<T_3> endure <T_0> rather than <T_1> it <T_2> wait for <T_4> weekend .
but <T_0> we were to be able to <T_1> that little <T_7> on <T_4> journey , we <T_6> to discover that , all too often , that <T_3> is going to be put on a boat , it &apos;s going to go all the way across the <T_5> at some expense , and it &apos;s going to <T_2> up in a developing country -- <T_9> china . <T_8>
<T_2> mean these <T_0> are extrapolating <T_4> realms that are <T_1> necessarily <T_3> .
each time <T_0> street juggle <T_1> use <T_2> .
and i got a <T_2> of them during <T_0> &apos;s been going on <T_4> this <T_6> , <T_5> everything <T_3> &apos;s been <T_1> .
<T_2> are we putting <T_1> energy behavior <T_3> <T_0> a credible , systematic <T_4> testing way ?
and <T_1> the end of it , somebody <T_3> , &quot; <T_6> , <T_4> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_7> difference <T_5> wellness <T_0> illness ? &quot;
<T_4> tell us <T_5> the <T_3> rate in <T_0> is 20 percent , and mortality estimates <T_1> it &apos;s only about <T_2> percent .
<T_1> first <T_0> this : that china is <T_3> really <T_2> nation-state .
and <T_5> don &apos;t <T_4> need <T_1> use this for just aesthetic customization , <T_6> can use <T_2> for functional <T_7> , scanning <T_3> of the body and creating <T_0> that <T_8> made to <T_9> .
<T_0> run some more of the <T_2> , and at the end of about <T_4> or <T_7> weeks , turns out <T_5> have mapped the exact trajectory <T_3> this satellite around the earth , <T_8> from listening <T_6> this one <T_1> signal , over <T_9> one morning .
so just bear with <T_2> . <T_0> &apos;ll go real <T_1> , you know ?
<T_0> i left everything <T_2> went for a <T_3> series <T_1> odd jobs .
<T_3> said : if <T_4> take the top <T_0> companies , <T_1> percentage <T_5> all <T_2> commodities do <T_6> touch , buy or <T_7> ?
<T_1> was a wonderful <T_0> .
now , ask <T_0> about <T_1> .
boy , it matters <T_7> lot because no one gets <T_3> the <T_2> office <T_6> sitting <T_4> side , not <T_9> the table , <T_1> no one gets <T_0> promotion if they don &apos;t think <T_8> deserve their <T_5> , or they don &apos;t even understand their own success .
<T_0> saves <T_1> .
and <T_1> might true <T_0> just <T_6> mere act <T_4> thinking <T_3> change <T_7> connectome -- an idea that <T_2> may find <T_5> .
<T_1> &quot; <T_3> inside <T_0> &quot; -- <T_2> does it work ?
imagine <T_0> this third <T_1> this room is filled with <T_4> who <T_2> different <T_3> .
this <T_2> peak <T_0> in a <T_1> seconds . the &apos; 60s .
<T_0> took 10 <T_1> to <T_2> .
the <T_1> in there <T_0> very <T_2> .
but <T_4> of it . these <T_1> , who <T_2> &apos;t had the <T_6> opportunities i &apos;d had , <T_5> me <T_3> post-graduate qualifications <T_7> law <T_0> their dedicated help .
and <T_0> there &apos;s <T_1> ; <T_6> &apos;s <T_3> famous actor &apos;s voice ; <T_2> &apos;s <T_4> projections ; there &apos;s no televisions ; there &apos;s no color <T_5> .
<T_7> i conducted <T_1> study and i <T_4> half of <T_3> data points <T_2> that one <T_0> , you would rightly <T_5> me , essentially , <T_8> research <T_6> .
so <T_1> &apos;s africa looking <T_0> today ?
he thought <T_0> space and time <T_6> explained <T_5> isaac <T_3> -- <T_4> were <T_2> ; <T_7> just <T_1> there forever .
did you want <T_0> ?
and as it turns out , that &apos;s <T_8> really hard problem , because <T_5> have to build a <T_9> , portable <T_6> that &apos;s <T_7> only really <T_0> , <T_3> it has to be something <T_1> people actually want to take <T_2> and have <T_4> their kids .
some of <T_2> are <T_1> well known , <T_3> the <T_0> .
<T_5> is <T_2> bit <T_3> ambition and <T_6> -- <T_4> &apos;m going <T_0> do that . i &apos;m going to <T_1> hard .
and <T_1> spreads on out <T_0> into a <T_2> .
ok .
<T_1> don &apos;t know <T_0> causes them .
what &apos;s going to <T_2> in the end , it &apos;s <T_9> going to be just humans <T_3> space , it &apos;s going to be <T_0> moving out from <T_6> earth , moving it into <T_4> kingdom . and the kingdom of <T_8> , of course , is going to be the universe . and if life is <T_5> there , it makes it much more <T_1> , in the short <T_7> .
<T_3> look <T_7> your x-rays <T_8> a <T_1> and you <T_6> stuff with them , you email them . but <T_5> were <T_0> using x-rays , but we <T_4> &apos;t <T_2> have a <T_9> box !
we <T_1> -- yeah <T_3> don &apos;t know <T_2> we <T_0> fixable .
<T_3> of <T_0> theory , <T_1> . <T_2> us <T_5> you &apos;re actually going to <T_4> , all right ?
<T_9> mean <T_8> &apos;s probably <T_5> wet dream for a <T_0> to be <T_4> to go inside of <T_6> patient &apos;s heart before you actually do surgery <T_2> and <T_3> that with <T_1> resolution <T_7> .
the steel industry is <T_6> far <T_3> of the design industry that <T_0> you <T_2> advantage of it you can even start to <T_4> of beams and columns all <T_8> together <T_5> a single system <T_9> is highly <T_1> , but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that <T_7> very beautiful and organic .
if you look <T_1> here , <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> . if you look <T_5> here , then <T_0> get conflicting <T_2> .
just , i <T_2> to keep my <T_0> through new <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_1> got to let me know <T_3> there are <T_0> .
and <T_0> hydrothermal vents <T_2> in <T_1> acidic environment .
<T_2> if <T_1> just scroll around , it &apos;s just <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> latest <T_0> we &apos;ve found , <T_4> a file <T_3> server.exe .
two hundred million <T_0> a <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_4> that they have <T_5> be done <T_0> we just <T_3> , <T_1> face or three-quarters .
sixty-five <T_4> years ago , a very important <T_1> catastrophic <T_2> changed the course <T_3> life <T_0> land .
when <T_2> was 12 <T_6> old , i <T_0> one of <T_1> first few <T_3> in singapore <T_4> underwent cochlear <T_5> .
<T_0> thing .
<T_3> : until <T_0> vehicle flies , <T_1> percent of your <T_2> is that first <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> picture <T_4> took <T_0> alaska , a <T_3> years ago , of <T_5> .
she <T_3> that <T_2> did not <T_1> how <T_4> use a <T_0> .
so <T_2> &apos;s get a sense of <T_3> is happening in <T_1> part of <T_0> world .
one single thing <T_0> everybody <T_2> going to because it didn &apos;t have the traditional <T_3> path of <T_1> that <T_5> might <T_4> .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , because , <T_0> mean , <T_1> sort of says it all , doesn &apos;t it ?
<T_0> said , &quot; <T_1> &apos;s not <T_2> . &quot;
and i <T_0> suggesting <T_3> every bit will be <T_2> by the <T_1> .
<T_8> ? because they <T_3> assume <T_7> the <T_0> is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into <T_4> streets , while in fact <T_5> may actually be the new opium for <T_2> masses which will keep the <T_6> people in <T_9> rooms downloading <T_1> .
<T_1> don &apos;t know if you <T_3> still see the <T_0> line here and up <T_2> arm .
because <T_4> we feel <T_2> we get dumped <T_5> win employee <T_3> the month <T_1> on how <T_6> interpret that <T_0> .
<T_0> : you know , over the years , every year at the conference , it &apos;s kind of become a <T_1> for <T_8> to do something <T_3> with <T_5> . and we &apos;ve always done <T_9> with the <T_4> in our <T_7> . it &apos;s <T_6> , for years i did it with daniel holding <T_2> .
and <T_0> &apos;s going to do so for <T_1> reasons .
<T_5> we <T_3> at the <T_7> , 60 <T_4> of baccalaureate degrees are going to <T_2> now , <T_6> is <T_1> significant <T_0> .
my father <T_2> my <T_3> were always looking for <T_4> newest thing in <T_0> or <T_9> therapies for <T_5> , but after <T_1> months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a <T_7> hill . i <T_6> &apos;t climb a <T_8> of stairs .
you <T_1> &apos;t possibly <T_7> that . <T_8> &apos;s not intended <T_5> you read <T_4> , but <T_3> &apos;s a <T_0> part of the chemical <T_9> going on <T_2> each of <T_6> cells at any given moment .
<T_3> out of <T_0> of <T_1> live in the <T_2> world .
what <T_4> realized : <T_7> isn &apos;t <T_8> the <T_6> symmetries , but <T_2> they interact with each other <T_3> really <T_0> the <T_5> of an <T_1> .
and so <T_1> needed <T_0> of people to <T_2> this .
<T_9> example , if you have read — i suspect many <T_1> you have done so — read the book by thomas <T_5> called &quot; the <T_2> is flat , &quot; he said , basically , in his <T_8> that , you know , this <T_0> for free trade is <T_4> because it assumes , it &apos;s based on <T_7> mistaken assumption that <T_3> that can be invented has <T_6> invented .
at <T_0> point , they <T_1> give up .
now , why do <T_1> think <T_3> is the <T_2> to make <T_0> argument ?
<T_0> alhambra <T_2> asks all of <T_1> questions .
but when <T_2> does happen , and <T_5> changes get <T_0> down through the <T_3> , <T_4> become markers <T_1> descent .
<T_6> the <T_1> to this is we <T_9> to find a <T_3> that people like michael semple , or those other people , who are telling the truth , who <T_5> the country , who &apos;ve spent <T_4> years on the ground -- <T_2> most importantly <T_8> all , the <T_0> component of this -- <T_7> themselves , who understand what is going on .
but <T_1> think <T_0> can do both at the <T_3> time <T_2> .
so his <T_3> of a natural <T_0> was one <T_4> which <T_6> air molecules <T_2> just spread out evenly <T_5> -- <T_1> everything molecules .
all right , so <T_1> &apos;s watch this <T_0> again .
and so of <T_0> there &apos;s the <T_1> emotions .
<T_0> was silvia <T_1> right ?
but you <T_0> what ?
as an <T_2> , i have to <T_1> something <T_0> this .
<T_0> are <T_4> robots that <T_3> inspire , <T_1> mecho-geckos from <T_2> .
<T_6> god <T_5> his head <T_1> said , &quot; not this <T_0> , not this <T_4> , <T_7> not even <T_2> your <T_3> . &quot;
the <T_1> jobs that <T_2> is talking about creating <T_0> those <T_5> -- the <T_3> that have been in decline , <T_4> and over .
it &apos;s <T_2> the <T_0> from the <T_1> .
<T_8> i would like <T_2> invite you from <T_3> industry you &apos;re from to <T_7> us in <T_5> and <T_9> the world , how things come together <T_1> the nanoscale to the <T_4> scale , so that we can go from a <T_6> like this to a <T_0> that &apos;s more like this .
<T_0> fantastic <T_2> didn &apos;t happen <T_1> itself .
and <T_1> would <T_0> add <T_2> saw the same thing with <T_3> .
i find <T_4> little <T_0> , <T_3> little <T_1> pieces of design , to be <T_2> .
<T_1> people <T_2> me took <T_0> job .
<T_6> , <T_9> one <T_5> back in 1929 <T_2> the great astronomer edwin <T_1> realized that <T_8> distant <T_0> were all <T_7> away <T_4> us , establishing that space itself is <T_3> , it &apos;s expanding .
<T_0> it <T_1> a staggering 1.5 trillion <T_2> .
a <T_0> of people feel that way <T_1> consciousness , i &apos;ve discovered .
these are <T_0> powerful <T_1> .
and <T_0> we can get started <T_1> with things <T_3> we know <T_2> effective .
<T_5> corneille <T_2> talks about his <T_3> at the okapi faunal reserve <T_9> the congo basin -- and <T_1> heroic work <T_7> it <T_4> poachers , <T_8> and <T_0> civil <T_6> .
and <T_0> was looking <T_1> that , trying to <T_4> out <T_2> it <T_3> .
<T_0> if you take all <T_5> together , <T_4> probably share less <T_2> 30,000 and <T_7> maybe a <T_6> or <T_3> different gene <T_1> .
<T_0> interesting .
and so <T_4> in <T_2> way is <T_3> ultimate <T_0> of this <T_1> .
<T_1> know <T_5> to reduce <T_3> transmission and <T_0> risks <T_4> people who inject <T_2> .
and <T_1> basically , <T_2> has been the <T_0> consensus &apos; process .
<T_2> were they <T_0> years ago , and where <T_1> they <T_3> ?
my <T_8> is understanding you <T_4> , and <T_9> you <T_0> the government <T_7> get <T_5> benefits , how you interact <T_2> corporations to <T_1> whom <T_3> &apos;re going to do <T_6> with , and how you view brands .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> thing .
the <T_1> , for the most part , do ducts <T_0> the ceilings <T_2> stuff .
<T_6> this person doesn &apos;t follow directions , then they may end up <T_3> them and then find out afterward <T_8> , <T_9> , <T_7> shot the <T_5> person , <T_1> , no , <T_0> was just an <T_4> person who <T_2> &apos;t understand what was going on .
everything came <T_2> negative , <T_1> 100,000 <T_3> worth of <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_3> phenomenal <T_5> . <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> equivalent <T_6> 2,500 tgv trains , and just <T_2> , they didn &apos;t have to lay a <T_7> or buy a <T_8> .
fifteen to <T_1> percent of <T_4> pregnancies <T_2> in <T_3> , and i find <T_0> astounding .
okay . thank you .
<T_1> then all <T_0> are off .
<T_0> next thing <T_2> &apos;d like to be clear about is <T_3> this <T_4> is , and what <T_1> problem <T_5> &apos;t .
<T_3> see <T_1> he <T_0> . you see how <T_2> lives .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_6> couple . he &apos;s projecting out <T_1> us , and <T_2> &apos;s clearly projecting , you know , <T_4> and <T_5> at <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;ll see <T_0> every time fantasy and <T_2> shows rise , it <T_1> to a <T_3> in <T_4> .
or <T_0> it was 31 <T_2> a quarter <T_1> .
wofford <T_2> president <T_6> dunlap tells the <T_0> of sandor <T_7> , a hungarian <T_5> who <T_1> him about passionate <T_4> and lifelong <T_3> .
<T_4> program for the <T_3> siblings so <T_0> younger ones <T_1> not stopped from coming to <T_2> .
<T_0> mean , you &apos;re looking at the sales <T_1> marketing <T_2> .
<T_2> girl named <T_1> said , &quot; you <T_0> my mother ? &quot;
<T_1> understood <T_4> breast cancer at the molecular level ; <T_3> had <T_2> need to touch <T_0> breasts .
so the <T_3> economy is becoming a place where women <T_2> more successful than men , believe it or not , <T_9> these economic changes <T_1> starting to rapidly affect <T_5> culture -- <T_7> our <T_4> comedies look like , what <T_6> marriages look like , what our <T_8> lives look like , and our <T_0> set of superheroes .
we <T_1> had our first <T_0> trust <T_2> meeting three <T_3> ago .
<T_8> then <T_3> to <T_1> conference , <T_0> realized that <T_2> everybody here shared those same <T_6> because really what <T_7> is is <T_4> agent of <T_5> .
twenty-four <T_0> had now passed <T_1> the <T_3> of the <T_2> .
and let <T_2> start by <T_0> you , <T_1> gotcha .
<T_3> do ; <T_7> &apos;re <T_4> codified <T_1> that <T_2> &apos;ve come <T_6> with , <T_5> are more-or-less <T_0> by the community .
<T_1> was a game of <T_2> questions like <T_0> .
and <T_4> of this <T_0> the scope <T_3> forms <T_1> we <T_2> produce .
<T_5> in all <T_3> area , they &apos;re only rarely <T_1> breeding more <T_0> five kilometers away <T_2> human <T_4> .
and i &apos;m choosing to come out of <T_7> totally different kind of <T_6> today <T_3> encourage you , <T_5> urge you , <T_2> if you are <T_1> who has contemplated or attempted <T_4> , or <T_0> know somebody <T_8> has , talk about it ; get <T_9> .
we <T_2> it &apos;s a <T_3> of not <T_1> , <T_4> a question of <T_0> .
<T_0> so , then how <T_3> we go about creating <T_2> that is <T_1> new ?
i &apos;m hoping that i &apos;ll teach culture <T_1> these <T_0> .
<T_3> of <T_0> is just obtaining trust <T_1> individuals that we work <T_4> in the <T_2> .
they <T_0> sex . <T_2> hide <T_1> predators .
<T_2> i was in <T_3> school <T_0> had created <T_1> v.o.i.c.e .

what about martin <T_0> king ?
<T_1> you . i have <T_0> missions <T_2> today .
<T_2> &apos;s go back a <T_0> years in time <T_3> see <T_1> happened back then .
but <T_2> they learn these <T_1> are going to give them <T_0> than they <T_3> .
<T_9> her talk , longtime <T_8> teacher patricia <T_6> asks a <T_0> question : is <T_7> world &apos;s focus <T_5> english preventing <T_2> spread <T_1> great ideas <T_3> other languages ? it &apos;s a passionate defense <T_4> translating and sharing ideas . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
<T_1> several things <T_0> important .
<T_2> would have <T_0> informality of <T_1> town square .
when the <T_0> of the president of a desperately <T_8> country starts buying mansions <T_7> sportscars on <T_9> official monthly salary of $ 7,000 , charmian <T_3> suggests , corruption is probably somewhere <T_5> the <T_2> . in a blistering , eye-opening <T_4> , she details how global corruption <T_1> follow the money -- to some surprisingly <T_6> faces .
<T_1> you have <T_2> child at <T_0> .
<T_5> is <T_6> fairly heavily litigated <T_0> , <T_2> we &apos;ve <T_1> that there are niches in the <T_4> world that aren &apos;t served terribly well by <T_3> classic commercial publishing <T_7> .
<T_3> has taken <T_8> to <T_6> , mexico , where <T_0> was a <T_5> ago , where <T_4> have literally been there <T_7> parking lots <T_1> bones of women have <T_2> up and been dumped next to coca-cola <T_9> .
the <T_0> is for <T_2> population , <T_1> population expansion .
and <T_5> years from now , all of <T_2> current <T_6> ideas will be <T_0> as truths <T_1> the <T_3> and <T_4> communities .
<T_2> do you let them <T_1> and have <T_0> ? &quot;
<T_3> &apos;ve probably <T_0> all this before , but <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> go back over it .
and <T_0> map <T_2> actually <T_1> little bit bigger .
<T_3> ? <T_2> it is <T_1> quantum <T_0> . it &apos;s quantum physics .
basically , gerontology <T_3> a <T_0> approach in the end , <T_5> it is not an approach <T_2> time <T_1> come <T_4> we &apos;re talking about <T_6> .
this <T_0> a turquoise <T_1> .
<T_2> , so <T_1> , here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ve split <T_0> in its <T_2> .
so where <T_3> used to think of heart disease as being a man &apos;s problem primarily -- which that was <T_6> true , but <T_4> was kind of how <T_1> thought in the <T_5> and &apos; 60s , <T_7> it <T_2> in <T_0> the textbooks .
one of <T_6> skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of <T_3> runway , banking . i could see into the cockpit , <T_4> battling <T_2> controls , <T_5> he just took <T_0> hand off , reached back , flipped a <T_1> on the roof of <T_7> cockpit , and it <T_8> the &quot; fasten seat belt &quot; sign you can see <T_9> the wall .
<T_3> the <T_2> of graphic design , for the <T_0> part , is <T_1> .
you <T_1> , <T_0> punishment was <T_2> .
and so she <T_0> have taken <T_1> ferry over .
<T_6> the 2008 <T_1> conference , famed puzzle designer scott <T_2> takes us <T_5> the puzzle-maker &apos;s frame of mind . <T_9> his career &apos;s work , he <T_7> a <T_4> of the most popular <T_3> , and shares the fascinations that <T_0> some of his <T_8> .
<T_0> can see <T_2> &apos;s pretty much <T_1> .
<T_5> &apos;m wearing a <T_0> , just a <T_2> webcam , a <T_6> , battery-powered <T_4> system with <T_1> little <T_3> .
but <T_3> i look towards the <T_2> , <T_4> next <T_5> is <T_1> unknown and <T_0> open .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_0> the <T_1> risk factor <T_2> glaucoma , which is just alzheimer &apos;s <T_4> of <T_3> eye .
and <T_2> thing is , we &apos;ve actually <T_0> here before <T_1> a society .
<T_9> &apos;s , and i &apos;m going to be fair <T_1> the statisticians who talked this <T_6> , not <T_4> 1.5 million people a week , but almost 1.4 <T_5> people a week but <T_2> &apos;m <T_8> journalist , <T_3> we exaggerate , <T_7> almost 1.5 million people a week , close to <T_0> million people a year .
<T_2> come <T_0> of the advertising <T_1> design business .
but <T_0> need to go <T_1> further .
so <T_7> &apos;s my <T_1> for <T_6> : <T_5> one of these two guys <T_0> more likely to have <T_4> for george <T_2> , which for <T_3> gore ?
<T_2> was <T_5> who broke <T_3> mayan <T_4> , enabling scholars <T_1> relate the <T_0> on mayan ceramics <T_6> the <T_7> of the mayan <T_8> .
<T_1> of all , it &apos;s <T_2> , and that takes <T_0> .
and <T_1> &apos;s the summary <T_0> what i &apos;m saying .
so <T_1> signal-to-noise ratio then presents us <T_0> a pattern-detection <T_2> .
basically , you <T_2> &apos;t have to <T_4> buy brand new things . you have condemned computers that are <T_3> apart , and you can buy salvaged components and <T_1> that you can <T_0> in a new <T_5> .
<T_2> we <T_1> be something is not <T_0> .
all consciousness <T_0> about <T_1> .
head <T_0> ego , <T_1> id .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> over . summer is <T_1> .
<T_8> &apos;s <T_6> called the <T_2> microbiome <T_7> that &apos;s going on in <T_0> united <T_9> , <T_3> metahit going on <T_4> europe , <T_5> a lot of <T_1> projects .
if we continue to pile upon <T_6> in cities , as <T_2> do in <T_5> , <T_0> shall <T_7> as corrupt <T_9> they are <T_3> europe and take to <T_8> one another <T_1> they <T_4> there . &quot;
<T_3> : <T_0> the teachers , and that was really <T_2> for <T_1> teachers .
<T_4> , <T_3> &apos;s quite appropriate <T_1> this <T_0> is called a <T_2> .
he <T_5> one <T_3> who <T_6> , &quot; the only time <T_4> physician and <T_2> physicist get together is <T_1> the <T_7> gets <T_0> . &quot;
freeflying <T_0> more <T_2> three-dimensional <T_1> .
<T_4> that &apos;s one <T_2> why <T_0> ended up <T_1> they <T_3> .
<T_1> : i <T_0> .
i give this <T_5> sometimes with <T_1> , who was just re-elected to <T_7> board from the <T_9> -- to the <T_2> of the <T_6> , with <T_8> than twice <T_4> votes <T_0> the person who didn &apos;t make <T_3> .
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> after the <T_5> who <T_0> why it was <T_2> an <T_4> radius .
so <T_0> changed that <T_3> put , &quot; <T_2> is the <T_1> budweiser house .
&quot; on the other <T_1> , <T_3> don &apos;t have to get up at four every <T_0> morning to milk <T_2> labrador . &quot;
next , i do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , <T_7> i can say , three <T_4> . take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but i see <T_8> carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 683 squared , that &apos;s <T_1> times <T_9> , plus <T_0> squared is 466,489 , <T_2> up if i need it , rev up , take the 466 , <T_5> that to <T_6> , <T_3> get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
once <T_1> , <T_0> fat of the <T_3> goes to <T_2> .
and <T_0> see things like this .
<T_0> don &apos;t know where <T_1> start , where to <T_2> it .
and <T_8> was <T_0> the <T_3> at the time , and <T_5> called me . <T_7> was <T_1> sick , the <T_4> time <T_6> got <T_2> .
and <T_8> did . stories <T_6> change poured <T_7> from all <T_0> india , <T_3> nagaland in the <T_4> , to <T_2> in the <T_9> , from <T_5> in the north , to krishnagiri <T_1> the south .

so <T_3> of it <T_0> a <T_2> shack <T_1> biology .
well , one thing <T_1> know is <T_3> they tend to be <T_0> hard <T_2> overcome .
<T_1> you <T_0> . <T_2> you .
<T_1> was <T_0> ?
do <T_0> want milo <T_1> squash it ?
now , <T_3> explains <T_2> right-wing <T_1> creative <T_0> .
compare <T_0> to <T_3> airbag debate -- <T_1> about 30 <T_2> behind .
<T_0> &apos;s what you might <T_1> .
<T_0> might not <T_1> know .

<T_2> in parting <T_3> said , &quot; <T_4> there <T_1> i should <T_0> ? &quot;
none <T_5> china . there are <T_0> 250,000 registered <T_6> the <T_3> , <T_4> twice again <T_2> many who <T_7> not <T_1> for political reasons .
<T_0> , i &apos;ve really <T_7> actually <T_6> the world <T_1> , doing <T_5> of the <T_2> things <T_3> you saw <T_4> the video .
<T_3> , <T_4> believe <T_1> that kind of thinking offends <T_5> intellectual rigor <T_0> this <T_2> .
and <T_0> relationship to landscape <T_5> that <T_4> farmers who have been <T_2> the <T_1> piece of ground <T_3> 40 <T_6> .
but <T_0> you <T_3> visualize it , all <T_8> connections that <T_9> &apos;re doing right <T_4> -- this <T_5> an image of the <T_1> of the <T_7> -- <T_6> doesn &apos;t look <T_2> .
<T_1> , <T_2> , you know , <T_0> years . &quot;
<T_5> could <T_6> , <T_4> the will of the <T_7> who <T_3> now urgently pressing <T_1> all their <T_2> and all <T_0> will for peace .
people <T_9> -- and <T_4> was <T_5> a problem -- people assumed <T_1> if <T_0> had little <T_3> , <T_6> they had juvenile <T_2> , they &apos;d be <T_7> to <T_8> .
it <T_1> about design <T_0> deals with <T_3> and deals with <T_2> .
so <T_2> do you <T_1> about that -- the <T_3> -- <T_6> well , it &apos;s <T_5> irritating actually <T_0> nobody ever describes <T_4> a <T_7> is wearing .
and <T_1> make cells <T_0> .
<T_1> is <T_0> called ?
<T_3> dr. terry erwin , in 1983 , <T_2> the <T_1> , &quot; the <T_4> biotic <T_0> . &quot;
that &apos;s a good thing for <T_2> particular <T_4> problem , <T_0> it <T_5> nothing to <T_3> the <T_1> problem .
<T_5> it wasn &apos;t that <T_2> . <T_0> by the time <T_3> got out of that <T_4> , i was <T_1> functional at all .
<T_7> fire <T_5> used <T_3> clear out , <T_4> again , affected the ecology of <T_6> and <T_2> continents , and <T_0> used in <T_1> .
and <T_0> the man started explaining that actually the <T_5> resistance had <T_2> huge <T_7> : even <T_6> top experts could <T_1> manage to <T_4> an <T_3> , <T_8> &quot; indelible , &quot; the &quot; <T_9> &quot; blue ink .
for <T_1> dollar given <T_2> a <T_0> &apos;s program , <T_3> dollars are given <T_4> men &apos;s programs .
we <T_0> no <T_1> whatsoever .
it was <T_2> cheapest source of <T_1> in <T_0> .
<T_5> also want <T_4> tell you <T_1> share with you <T_2> my <T_3> and <T_6> have been using mushrooms over the <T_7> three <T_0> .
the <T_1> of your <T_0> continues outside becoming <T_2> facades .
<T_8> put <T_9> into <T_2> brain scan machine -- <T_3> is <T_5> by the way , <T_7> i don &apos;t care -- and <T_6> had them <T_1> a horror movie , and then they had <T_0> describe their <T_4> toward their wives .
now <T_0> situation , already i -- you know , i don &apos;t really <T_3> thinking about <T_1> , <T_8> somehow <T_9> got myself a job where i have to think about it . so the <T_7> is that we &apos;re <T_6> , <T_2> insecure <T_5> terms of developing <T_4> material .
<T_0> wealthy fanatics who <T_4> previously sponsoring this <T_3> of activity <T_1> now <T_2> generous .
but <T_0> should <T_4> talk stage five , <T_3> ? &quot; <T_2> is <T_1> . &quot;
but when <T_0> a <T_2> actually ever give you <T_1> invoice ?
<T_2> i &apos;ve gone <T_5> of the <T_1> to <T_3> if this really holds in <T_0> daily <T_4> .
well , it is <T_9> most important <T_3> of our <T_1> for a <T_2> simple , logical <T_4> , <T_8> , it &apos;s a <T_5> condition <T_7> anything being important in <T_6> lives that we &apos;re <T_0> .
so , <T_1> is , again , <T_0> daughter &apos;s dress .
<T_1> wasn &apos;t <T_6> years ago that <T_5> was <T_3> about -- we &apos;ve found <T_2> holy <T_0> of <T_4> .
over 100 <T_0> prescriptions of antidepressants are written every <T_1> in the <T_2> .
so when <T_0> asked him , he told <T_2> three <T_1> .

and then <T_1> had the <T_0> washing machine .
we could make a <T_1> long list , but obviously nelson mandela , emerging <T_5> 17 <T_2> of hard <T_0> labor , <T_8> years of imprisonment , with <T_4> amazing ability to forgive , so that <T_3> could lead his nation out the <T_9> regime of <T_6> without a <T_7> .
<T_9> he basically set up , or <T_4> shattered the <T_3> of disbelief , because what he photographed was the real thing , a <T_5> sub going down , or actually <T_0> mir <T_7> going down to <T_2> real wreck , <T_6> he created this <T_1> haunting <T_8> .
<T_5> mr. berlusconi <T_3> it , as <T_2> sits atop <T_4> huge empire <T_1> media and <T_0> and so on and so forth .
human <T_4> start putting <T_3> other into <T_0> the <T_2> that <T_5> see each other -- is <T_6> person dangerous ? are <T_1> attractive ?
so are <T_2> now <T_1> images of <T_0> past ?
if <T_0> are happy about <T_1> , you &apos;ll go <T_3> to the <T_2> side .
<T_1> &apos;s its <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;ve been asking it <T_2> at <T_0> already .
<T_3> cheetah generation <T_2> a new <T_0> of africans <T_4> brook no <T_1> about corruption .
<T_4> important <T_2> is that <T_0> will have started a process <T_3> is out of <T_1> &apos;s control .
<T_2> bernard <T_0> said it a little <T_1> .
how <T_3> that feel when they <T_1> and <T_2> you away , <T_5> your <T_0> completely <T_4> ?
in <T_6> , <T_1> instance , that organized <T_4> walk from a <T_0> to a mosque <T_3> a synagogue <T_5> all <T_2> an abrahamic meal <T_7> .
<T_2> really wanted to let <T_1> understand <T_4> the <T_0> of <T_3> were in an honest way .
but <T_0> researchers <T_1> a <T_2> .
<T_1> can make your <T_0> purpose .
and <T_4> we tried was this ; <T_2> is <T_3> device <T_0> the cadwell model <T_1> .
but <T_1> more surprising is if you look <T_4> socio-economic <T_9> , quantities <T_0> have no analog in <T_7> , <T_8> have evolved <T_6> we started <T_2> communities eight <T_5> 10,000 <T_3> ago .
<T_1> also presented to nike <T_0> .
<T_1> really love <T_0> . &quot;
<T_7> . and <T_0> i <T_9> through <T_5> neighborhood , say , where <T_2> got-a-lotta , i &apos;ll take a mockingbird <T_3> caught in a neighborhood <T_6> folks <T_8> &apos;t <T_1> nada and just let it go , <T_4> know .
<T_3> do you do <T_2> ? <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> upside down .
<T_0> in <T_3> , <T_2> are we teaching them <T_1> in general ?
but <T_6> politics is only management <T_7> mistrust , <T_8> -- <T_0> &apos;m very glad <T_3> &quot; <T_1> &quot; <T_9> been mentioned -- now <T_4> &apos;re going to have &quot; <T_5> &quot; in <T_2> .
<T_0> says &quot; <T_5> love <T_2> &quot; <T_6> &quot; <T_1> me find <T_3> else i give a <T_4> about . &quot;
and <T_2> come in and they go through <T_4> process , <T_5> process , they <T_1> confidence <T_3> now they <T_0> of themselves <T_6> .
<T_1> we make <T_2> drop-in replacement <T_4> that <T_3> that &apos;s made from <T_0> .
for <T_1> week or <T_2> , i had <T_0> eaten .
and <T_1> , which <T_2> right now in the <T_6> of the <T_4> , <T_0> going really strong with <T_3> whole <T_7> of <T_5> .
<T_5> we do <T_0> is <T_1> u.s.-enabled <T_3> force that <T_7> , &quot; you <T_4> me to take that guy down ? i &apos;ll <T_2> that guy <T_6> .
we &apos;re taking <T_1> data and building <T_0> models .
it <T_0> in that <T_2> games are <T_3> to make me <T_1> .
<T_4> tell us <T_0> our world <T_3> a lot of <T_5> ways , and <T_1> the <T_2> .
these countries &apos; <T_0> originate <T_1> stalin &apos;s decrees .
there &apos;s <T_0> predator in the ocean <T_2> it <T_1> out .
their <T_0> are patrice and <T_1> .

<T_1> didn &apos;t <T_2> out and <T_0> a bigger <T_3> .
<T_1> are the <T_0> .
that <T_2> the key <T_0> understanding <T_3> enormous <T_1> of consciousness .
so as <T_3> as i <T_1> to get <T_4> the <T_2> , <T_0> was firmly <T_5> off .
<T_5> &apos;s go to <T_3> video , <T_2> let me show you <T_1> of these <T_4> moving and <T_6> some of <T_7> simple <T_9> that have <T_0> inspired by our <T_8> .
<T_4> this <T_0> -- remember , <T_2> &apos;re excited <T_5> head-tail-tail ; <T_3> &apos;re excited <T_1> head-tail-head .
<T_2> question <T_1> , <T_4> ? why do <T_5> countries <T_3> a lot and some countries <T_0> a little ?
we also <T_1> him <T_4> underdog because goliath is <T_5> experienced warrior , <T_2> david is <T_0> a <T_3> .
we could do a <T_2> in <T_1> story that was literally <T_0> turn .
<T_1> at <T_2> waves coming here <T_0> shore .
how do you <T_6> all <T_0> scientific data <T_2> a <T_4> , the data <T_5> &apos;s changing on a <T_1> , <T_7> not a <T_3> , basis ?
today , you &apos;ve got <T_3> spend years in <T_2> school <T_4> post-doc <T_6> just <T_1> figure out <T_5> the important <T_0> are .
i <T_0> &apos;t have a phone number <T_2> call to say <T_1> was coming .
<T_2> should turn <T_1> into <T_0> &apos;s .
i <T_1> to start with <T_0> game .
&#91; <T_3> &#93; , <T_4> said <T_9> yesterday . i &apos;m just <T_1> it because <T_0> &apos;s what <T_2> follow <T_8> to <T_5> the shunyata <T_6> , the <T_7> .
i <T_3> some <T_0> ago <T_1> a joint <T_2> of <T_4> , last year .
<T_6> this <T_5> the <T_2> it <T_1> over , <T_4> we <T_3> from geological <T_7> that <T_0> regions are the oldest regions on mars .
<T_3> , <T_2> . <T_4> does <T_1> thing smell <T_0> cut grass , ok ?
<T_0> 2005 : <T_2> streets are <T_1> .
<T_0> are very cheap <T_1>
that &apos;s something that <T_0> cannot <T_1> right now .
<T_1> it &apos;s been slow to <T_0> .
see me now . don &apos;t talk about it later .
but <T_1> doesn &apos;t matter , <T_0> this is <T_2> forward .
now , is <T_2> possible ? people <T_1> ask : <T_0> would that cost ?
i <T_1> clean . <T_2> wasn &apos;t a bloody <T_0> in the place , it <T_4> just <T_3> .
so <T_8> &apos;s <T_1> shape . <T_7> actually spent about a <T_0> in my home , in <T_3> underwear , <T_4> , like <T_2> &#91; <T_6> &#93; , in <T_9> picture <T_5> .
so <T_2> situation <T_0> pretty <T_1> .
<T_1> i <T_0> that <T_5> pattern can unite <T_3> disparate elements , it <T_2> do just <T_4> anything .
<T_1> today &apos;s <T_3> , <T_0> turning powerful <T_5> to the <T_8> , have captured <T_4> handful of starkly <T_7> photons -- <T_9> kind of <T_6> telegram billions of <T_2> in transit .
it &apos;s like going to <T_0> nightclub .
<T_2> , i &apos;d like to show <T_3> something <T_1> came out of <T_0> collaborations .
<T_3> went <T_0> the local baker and <T_2> their <T_1> bread .
&#91; <T_3> &#93; they get <T_7> to 90-percent child <T_5> , <T_2> families decrease , and most of <T_1> arab countries <T_6> the middle <T_0> is falling down there &#91; to <T_4> families &#93; .
the <T_0> sector <T_1> well .
purple <T_1> tweets . <T_2> are <T_0> .
<T_1> was <T_3> milan last <T_0> , for the <T_2> launch .
and in this <T_8> , &quot; <T_1> projects , &quot; there are tons of projects that i &apos;m currently <T_6> on , projects that i &apos;ve already worked on , things that i might want to work on some day , <T_2> things that <T_9> may <T_5> want to find <T_7> buy <T_4> have and look <T_0> and <T_3> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_5> power <T_4> taking <T_6> piece of <T_7> , another piece <T_1> data , putting <T_2> together , and <T_3> the result .
<T_1> as we created <T_0> .
<T_1> think now <T_2> magnetic field may be diminished by <T_0> five percent .
<T_3> on <T_2> are <T_0> going to spread a <T_1> ideas ?
and , <T_1> you <T_0> , they <T_3> &apos;t use their <T_2> names .
this <T_4> to stop , and <T_3> wish <T_9> the change could come <T_0> the <T_2> at <T_5> top that <T_6> perpetuating these <T_8> , and i <T_7> them , i <T_1> them to just stop it .
in <T_2> , <T_5> &apos;m convinced i learned <T_0> narrative art <T_3> those nightly sessions <T_4> my <T_1> .
when people <T_7> about the need to <T_0> global food production <T_5> feed those <T_1> billion <T_4> that are <T_8> on <T_6> planet by <T_9> , i always <T_2> of <T_3> graphs .
<T_0> i don &apos;t really care about that . <T_1> don &apos;t care about that .
<T_1> here we are , <T_0> chimpanzee using <T_2> computer .
<T_2> people <T_0> because it &apos;s so <T_5> , and <T_1> our <T_6> food system in <T_3> last <T_4> years has <T_7> shifted .
well <T_5> , not pieces of plastic , <T_0> stone <T_2> , <T_6> , pottery <T_7> , surprisingly <T_8> one large <T_1> , which <T_4> found buried near the <T_3> of a city .
<T_1> is <T_0> of my favorite worldchanging kinds of things ever .
<T_6> you &apos;ve been punched <T_0> the <T_7> , then the <T_3> of <T_4> does <T_2> consist of teaching you <T_1> to avoid <T_5> .
<T_1> can add pop-ups <T_8> live links and <T_6> icons , <T_2> pull in content <T_0> any web <T_9> , like <T_3> , or add <T_5> and blog posts with <T_4> out to the full <T_7> .
<T_1> hit <T_0> space bar twice .
so i <T_3> to talk a <T_6> about <T_2> reasons why <T_8> <T_4> so well , and <T_7> <T_0> of those reasons kind of <T_5> on to where <T_1> web is going right <T_9> .
it &apos;s taken us a <T_0> way <T_3> , <T_2> there &apos;s so much <T_1> to come .
now <T_4> , <T_2> critic is <T_0> key <T_3> in what makes <T_1> intelligent .
and <T_8> took one look at sudhir , <T_0> was going to go do some surveys for <T_6> , <T_5> decided <T_2> knew <T_1> the place to send him -- which was to <T_3> of the <T_4> , most <T_9> housing <T_7> .
<T_1> is what <T_4> real one looks <T_0> , on the juan <T_2> fuca <T_3> .
<T_6> &apos;s <T_4> that <T_2> think <T_5> all need to ask <T_0> , which is , <T_7> we thought the <T_3> rested with <T_1> individual <T_8> .
actually , we will <T_2> a second <T_1> prove -- this could be fake -- that <T_0> blades are <T_3> razor-sharp .
<T_3> it &apos;s <T_1> using its <T_0> feet here , so <T_4> is very <T_2> .
in <T_2> end , <T_4> has a <T_3> with which <T_1> then can <T_0> .
<T_3> &apos;s better <T_0> prozac , but <T_1> wouldn &apos;t <T_2> it .
now <T_1> was <T_4> english <T_2> who <T_0> this kind of future where <T_3> would trade away our autonomy and <T_5> for <T_6> .
<T_1> went to my <T_2> : &quot; <T_0> , don &apos;t make me <T_3> this . &quot;
and <T_3> said it was the first dry season <T_7> his entire life that he hadn &apos;t taken <T_5> 12 <T_8> and 50 <T_4> on a two <T_1> journey across <T_0> desert to work as day laborers <T_6> a <T_9> farm for about 50 cents <T_2> day .
<T_4> of training <T_9> how <T_7> put forms <T_6> mobile <T_3> , let &apos;s create <T_2> that <T_5> them do it <T_8> with no training <T_1> without <T_0> being involved ?
<T_9> &apos;s <T_7> very <T_1> point of view , but <T_6> points <T_5> the reality <T_4> people <T_2> with the life they <T_0> and they <T_3> &apos;t want to be cured or changed <T_8> eliminated .
so i sent <T_0> online , of course , to look <T_1> up .
these <T_1> of the <T_0> are <T_2> down .
the <T_1> question <T_4> , why <T_0> it hotter in <T_2> than in <T_3> ?
<T_2> and children , <T_0> the poor , <T_1> at the <T_3> .
he <T_1> a 12-year-old <T_0> who <T_2> stolen a <T_3> .
it <T_1> a huge <T_0> .
<T_3> was thinking about mass produced <T_1> television sets <T_0> could be <T_4> to orbiting <T_2> satellites .
<T_1> actually think that , in <T_6> like <T_2> , <T_5> you can have physician-assisted <T_4> , you take <T_9> poisonous <T_8> of stuff , only <T_3> a percent of people <T_7> do <T_0> .
and they <T_4> back <T_5> forth <T_0> this <T_2> and <T_1> arena , via this <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_0> we &apos;re <T_3> going to <T_1> that go .
<T_2> apparatus is on <T_1> left <T_0> food on it .
<T_1> long , there <T_0> a massive underground potato-growing operation in <T_2> .
<T_6> is a <T_4> using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype , explaining <T_8> she <T_7> out of a portable <T_2> system <T_0> a <T_5> of <T_9> and <T_3> that are working with <T_1> in a hospital .
and <T_3> began to sense <T_4> different about the history , and what had happened before , and <T_7> nature of life in <T_6> very <T_5> village , and what you find as <T_8> joys , and your rituals , your <T_2> , your <T_1> with other families . and i <T_9> how this had a <T_0> of justice , in its responsibility .
<T_2> moyo : is <T_1> the <T_0> idol <T_3> emerging economies ?
and the shaman -- i <T_2> a whole <T_1> on shamanism , <T_0> interesting phenomenon . <T_3>
<T_4> way <T_5> unit <T_2> is , <T_1> the sun comes out the <T_0> will start <T_3> you <T_6> power out here .
so <T_0> do quite a <T_3> of work <T_4> ideo <T_2> to <T_5> our <T_1> of this .
a <T_0> process <T_2> calcite , which is <T_3> kind of <T_4> cement that <T_1> the grains <T_5> .
so , <T_2> implemented this <T_6> that <T_3> help <T_0> and <T_5> not <T_8> think in three <T_9> , but they <T_1> actually <T_7> so that it &apos;s more <T_4> to use that way .
and <T_5> can <T_3> it &apos;s <T_1> a <T_7> spectacular <T_8> of the limbs , <T_9> upward to actually just <T_4> a dead <T_0> of <T_6> that i had <T_2> it .
<T_4> previous highest <T_5> he <T_2> in <T_6> was a <T_3> from the team from <T_1> force , a <T_0> program .
<T_3> was playing <T_2> . i <T_4> to write the <T_1> bits , <T_0> ?
and the <T_3> we end up with -- that <T_1> which is a <T_4> bit less <T_8> one in <T_5> -- is <T_7> do with how likely <T_6> of those explanations <T_0> relative <T_9> the <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> in <T_3> , often , when <T_4> get tough , people go for walks <T_0> the woods .
<T_2> will go <T_1> 60 <T_0> 120 .
this <T_6> a <T_4> group , we <T_1> all <T_5> said , made <T_0> wael <T_3> in egypt and his <T_2> .
but you <T_6> , this <T_7> a <T_4> audience , and <T_3> i <T_0> talking about <T_2> , <T_5> &apos;re going <T_1> turn off .
but <T_1> , <T_0> is just <T_3> beginning from our <T_2> .
so where <T_0> we <T_1> ?
<T_2> were getting quite <T_0> few caught <T_1> surface drift nets .
so , that &apos;s very <T_1> , and <T_0> &apos;s what we want .
but <T_1> do <T_0> go about doing all this <T_2> ?
and <T_1> is pure <T_0> water .
<T_1> he &apos;s going <T_0> .
<T_0> already <T_2> -- this <T_1> 25,000 images .
<T_1> new <T_0> .
you have <T_2> , <T_0> have <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> stepped there before .
there &apos;s another <T_0> that thinks <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> to this but <T_4> the <T_2> assumption .
<T_8> life appeared <T_3> earth <T_7> half a billion <T_4> of <T_5> being possible , <T_2> is <T_1> compared <T_0> the 10-billion-year lifetime <T_6> a <T_9> of earth type .
it &apos;s like <T_0> new <T_1> .
<T_9> sue austin got a power chair 16 years ago , <T_1> felt a tremendous sense <T_4> freedom -- yet others looked at <T_7> as <T_0> she had lost something . <T_8> her art , <T_6> aims to convey the spirit of wonder she feels <T_5> through the world . <T_2> thrilling footage of an underwater wheelchair that lets her explore ocean beds , drifting through schools of fish , floating <T_3> in 360 degrees .
so here <T_7> processes on board are getting <T_2> from <T_1> and gyros <T_5> board and <T_4> , like <T_0> said <T_8> , commands at <T_9> times a second <T_3> this robot <T_6>
so <T_4> can run <T_0> through to something like <T_3> , <T_2> is highly specialized <T_5> an individual &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_0> don &apos;t take the dog &apos;s point of <T_1> into account .
<T_1> excitement of a <T_2> orchestra <T_5> comes from the <T_7> to have <T_0> collective <T_3> musicians producing one <T_4> whole <T_6> .
and <T_1> had <T_0> .
so <T_1> had some <T_5> ideas : we <T_6> old automobile <T_3> , put paper <T_0> them and created <T_2> first <T_7> to <T_4> whiteboard .
<T_1> is not <T_0> .
it causes these <T_0> events that are the <T_2> signs of corals <T_1> being sick .
<T_5> one hand , we can <T_1> the <T_6> secrets of <T_8> universe <T_4> dramatically push back the <T_2> of <T_7> , as <T_3> conference <T_0> demonstrates .
but the <T_3> thing here <T_2> that they &apos;re paying with <T_0> time , <T_1> that <T_4> time <T_5> would have had to <T_6> been spent <T_7> learning the language .
<T_0> imagine <T_1> .
<T_6> today i &apos;m going to <T_4> to you <T_3> something you <T_1> &apos;t <T_5> -- what &apos;s <T_7> up in <T_2> little <T_0> of hers .
<T_0> you &apos;re too <T_1> , you &apos;ll miss the <T_3> interesting <T_2> ideas .
<T_9> &apos;s <T_2> in <T_7> , <T_0> how <T_3> revolution is about to <T_8> everything <T_4> know about the <T_5> , <T_1> , ourselves , and how <T_6> think about them .
and <T_1> believe <T_2> answer <T_0> yes .
but there &apos;s a <T_1> : you build a <T_0> .
<T_3> we <T_1> orders for flowers . i &apos;m <T_4> the bake <T_0> to <T_2> .
i <T_8> believe <T_3> life is <T_7> much <T_4> adventure if <T_2> manage to do <T_1> without <T_9> trench between <T_5> left <T_6> the right <T_0> .
<T_1> believe in <T_0> differently .
<T_4> like all <T_3> soaps , <T_2> jumps <T_0> years <T_5> the audience <T_1> changes .
what &apos;s interesting <T_2> that at <T_0> same time , the number <T_5> genes <T_3> we &apos;re <T_1> is rising very <T_4> .
<T_4> if our <T_3> , our <T_5> , <T_0> , all of <T_1> bricks could actually <T_2> .
how <T_0> we make <T_1> all by <T_2> ?
<T_4> fascism took over <T_0> in the <T_3> , an unlikely <T_2> came out of <T_1> .
<T_1> they &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m just saying , you <T_0> .
<T_1> said , &quot; <T_0> , no , <T_2> .
so <T_2> take <T_3> and you <T_1> it <T_0> beer .
i <T_1> &apos;t <T_2> make this <T_3> up because <T_0> &apos;s that <T_4> .
this <T_2> is a &quot; third <T_3> , &quot; a <T_0> device <T_1> long-term asthma treatment .
polar bears on the artic ocean <T_1> in <T_2> straight <T_0> .
<T_7> , <T_4> maybe <T_3> , 10 <T_5> , maybe i <T_1> die within <T_0> year , or <T_2> like <T_6> .
it &apos;s <T_4> 90 <T_3> . <T_0> , you tell <T_2> you sleep <T_1> than <T_5> .
okay , now i &apos;ve given <T_6> a lot of numbers here , but they &apos;re <T_7> big <T_5> , okay , so , you know , keep <T_9> in mind . there &apos;s <T_1> of real estate , plenty of real estate <T_8> the universe , and if <T_3> &apos;re the only bit of real estate in which there &apos;s some interesting occupants , that makes you <T_2> miracle , <T_4> i know you like to think you &apos;re a miracle , but if you do science , you learn rather quickly that every time you think you &apos;re a <T_0> , you &apos;re wrong , so probably not the case .
so <T_1> do <T_0> think ?
<T_6> then , to have to deal with large <T_2> , <T_5> , at <T_1> nation-state level , and we <T_3> to have mutual non-aggression , or through a <T_8> of <T_0> , <T_9> eventually came to a rough <T_7> bargain to largely keep <T_4> peace .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> plastic bag .
<T_5> with <T_2> , <T_3> hole does get <T_0> , at <T_6> temporarily , but <T_4> before exacting a <T_1> price .
and now <T_0> are <T_2> as can <T_1> .
so <T_7> first thing <T_2> &apos;d like <T_8> a <T_6> -- <T_5> anybody <T_1> this as a <T_0> -- is to come up with <T_3> name <T_9> that stuff on the bottom <T_4> .
<T_1> self became defined <T_2> otherness , <T_3> meant <T_4> , in <T_5> social <T_6> , i didn &apos;t <T_0> exist .
what we found <T_2> were <T_3> those faint wisps are <T_5> fountains of ice <T_6> up <T_4> the <T_1> of this tiny <T_0> .
health <T_1> from the region <T_0> conflicting and <T_2> .
and at <T_2> same <T_1> , i thought <T_7> this massive group <T_4> people i knew : <T_0> , <T_5> , journalists , <T_8> , <T_6> , you name <T_3> .
<T_0> knows <T_1> .
and <T_0> someone discovered <T_2> &quot; a-ha moment &quot; where you could <T_1> coordinate systems .
<T_0> you .
and underneath <T_0> microscope there were <T_1> .
would <T_1> spend your remaining <T_2> dollars <T_3> a <T_0> ?
let &apos;s see <T_1> they <T_0> around <T_2> ideas .
i know i <T_1> one of <T_2> first <T_3> people to have this <T_0> .
and <T_7> i &apos;m in <T_3> turbulent times , <T_6> we know , <T_1> i am right now , through <T_4> crucible <T_0> the <T_9> of <T_5> , <T_8> is what all of you do , <T_2> .
okay .
<T_1> &apos;s getting closer <T_2> closer , and in <T_0> ...
getting them <T_5> and <T_2> and <T_3> , and <T_1> on <T_4> reconsideration , getting them <T_0> again . &quot;
she had come seeking <T_3> investment dollars so that she could <T_6> the factory <T_4> buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to africa , europe , the middle east and far <T_5> -- capital that would help <T_1> to <T_0> more than <T_8> 20 <T_7> that she already has working for her , and capital that would <T_9> her own <T_2> &apos;s economic climb .
im : <T_1> , <T_0> .
<T_1> people do <T_3> their bodies <T_2> art and <T_0> .
in fact , my <T_1> told me <T_0> that i was <T_2> little kid <T_4> the village who <T_3> all the way to school .
<T_2> &apos;s one <T_1> my fellow <T_7> . <T_4> &apos;s charles <T_3> who won the 2000 <T_6> prize for his paper , &quot; <T_0> of ostriches <T_9> humans <T_8> farming conditions in britain <T_5> &quot;
and <T_2> want to argue that what we <T_0> is <T_3> try <T_1> change everything .
so <T_3> go down <T_0> side of the mountain , they <T_1> down <T_2> .
<T_3> krens came to <T_0> with <T_2> and <T_6> it all to <T_1> , <T_5> i thought he <T_4> nuts .
you &apos;ve got a plane that &apos;s thousands of <T_8> up in the <T_4> , going at hundreds of <T_9> an hour , <T_6> you &apos;re <T_0> to drop an <T_2> , a <T_7> , towards <T_3> stationary target in the face of all kinds of <T_1> and <T_5> cover and all kinds of other impediments .
and <T_1> you zoom in <T_3> times , you &apos;ll see it looks <T_0> a <T_2> .
<T_2> highline <T_0> an old , elevated rail line <T_4> runs for a <T_3> and a half right <T_1> manhattan .
but i <T_3> &apos;t remember <T_4> how it <T_0> , but i have one <T_5> , <T_1> pretty strong <T_6> my <T_2> .
<T_2> we <T_5> only work <T_4> out as people were seeing <T_3> between <T_1> thuggish <T_6> of nature <T_0> gang warfare .
i used the <T_0> and also the students helped <T_7> to <T_6> all <T_5> building <T_1> to make <T_2> comfortable , within the budget of the <T_8> but also the <T_4> of the <T_9> is exactly the <T_3> , but much more comfortable .
so , the <T_1> is , <T_3> and <T_0> , all of our <T_2> are <T_4> .
<T_5> i think <T_8> &apos;s <T_3> of what we &apos;re seeing in <T_4> world in <T_1> , that the world is becoming smaller <T_2> smaller , and <T_9> all of the <T_6> in the world are enjoying <T_7> opportunities for <T_0> .

it <T_1> lots of <T_0> , lots of fertilizer , lots of <T_2> .
<T_4> would just like <T_8> add a crass commercial -- i have a <T_6> &apos; book coming <T_3> in the fall called &quot; marvel sandwiches , &quot; <T_9> compendium of all the serious <T_0> that ever <T_1> , and it &apos;s going to <T_2> available in <T_7> bookstores , crummy bookstores , <T_5> on the street in october .

<T_2> we &apos;ve <T_7> in <T_6> next <T_0> years , <T_4> will double the <T_3> of <T_5> material we put through <T_1> business .
so , you know , <T_2> who are in <T_1> straits can <T_0> this .
<T_0> you .
<T_0> certainly believed <T_1> .

so <T_7> team can <T_0> look at all the <T_3> components that heat <T_5> structure <T_2> make choices <T_6> then <T_1> the end result <T_4> is visualized on this screen .

<T_1> let <T_0> show you cutting-edge robotics .
and that &apos;s what it was in the early <T_0> .
so we came up with <T_2> protocell <T_1> here <T_0> i &apos;m <T_3> .
<T_3> was <T_0> called <T_2> , the one who rode the <T_1> .

and those <T_3> clips will be <T_8> by a <T_0> of perhaps <T_4> , to me , is really <T_1> greatest <T_2> which is a <T_5> in <T_7> , <T_6> .
<T_2> they grow <T_0> own <T_1> .
to -- you <T_0> by envisioning yourself as a scientist , and then you learn to <T_1> yourself as a scientist .
she <T_3> , &quot; <T_7> thought <T_1> i wanted to <T_6> a doctor , but <T_5> i really <T_2> to be was somebody <T_0> served <T_8> healed <T_4> cured .
and <T_1> was trying <T_2> to bring them back to <T_0> .
<T_1> it &apos;s <T_3> , <T_0> &apos;s the <T_2> sox , right ?
meanwhile , there are <T_3> people <T_0> to <T_2> the <T_1> .
<T_4> can get your <T_5> or <T_7> . how <T_1> have ever got a <T_2> or <T_0> and <T_3> , is <T_6> all there is ?
there <T_4> a <T_6> when <T_5> age men <T_7> women used to <T_3> and look up at the <T_1> and <T_8> , &quot; <T_2> are <T_0> twinkling lights ? &quot;
<T_1> is just <T_0> .
<T_1> adams <T_0> , <T_2> i &apos;m going to disagree with <T_3> , &quot; <T_5> don &apos;t take a <T_6> , <T_4> make <T_7> . &quot;
<T_4> center committee of <T_1> red <T_6> had judged <T_0> too single-minded and <T_3> opinionated <T_5> become a good <T_2> .
<T_3> psychopath -- <T_1> speaks to <T_0> and <T_4> lack <T_2> empathy .
<T_4> first one is <T_2> simple : experience bars <T_8> progress -- <T_6> that &apos;s been talked <T_7> brilliantly <T_1> people <T_3> jesse <T_0> earlier <T_5> year .
<T_2> water body , dried up , of course , during <T_3> summer period , <T_7> you <T_4> see <T_6> the traditional <T_5> combines engineering <T_1> aesthetics , with <T_0> heart .
it &apos;s not <T_3> material <T_0> we <T_4> . it &apos;s the <T_1> we <T_2> .
one <T_1> ago to <T_0> very <T_3> , i woke <T_2> .
<T_2> , just <T_1> couple <T_0> are required .
perhaps <T_0> comes in as a <T_2> , and <T_3> as well . and perhaps cuba <T_4> to be one of the partners in <T_5> four-way joint <T_1> .
the <T_0> there , z goes into <T_1> squared <T_2> plus c . <T_3>
you then <T_0> some body part descriptions : &quot; <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> the <T_3> , in <T_2> breast , <T_1> the <T_6> . &quot;
he <T_1> before he <T_0> .

just <T_4> weeks ago , a <T_3> introduced by <T_6> kefalas that would have <T_2> athletes , kids <T_5> 18 , <T_0> wear <T_7> helmet when they &apos;re <T_8> died <T_1> committee .
so part of my <T_7> , and part of <T_0> wishes , is sitting with these <T_1> in mind , and thinking about , &quot; <T_6> is their life going to <T_9> when they <T_2> to have <T_3> , <T_5> when they &apos;re ready to get married <T_4> years from now -- or whatever , 15 <T_8> from now ? &quot;
but all that <T_5> , <T_1> still <T_2> a problem , and <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> real <T_0> .
<T_4> knew <T_1> would fail <T_3> it doesn &apos;t work <T_2> improve the <T_0> of the local <T_5> .
i <T_1> my <T_0> .
and <T_4> remembered back to about <T_6> years <T_1> when i read <T_7> book by <T_3> faludi called &quot; stiffed : <T_0> betrayal of the american man , &quot; in which she described <T_9> hard <T_2> recession had hit <T_5> , <T_8> i started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession .
so <T_0> i understood <T_4> chemistry of <T_3> , i <T_1> help alleviate <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;m sorry <T_0> don &apos;t have a playful-looking <T_6> , but <T_4> allows <T_3> , which has <T_5> the <T_2> study of play .
<T_2> , i commissioned <T_5> wonderful <T_7> , nico muhly , <T_4> wrote nine <T_1> using the text , and <T_6> performed this fantastic <T_9> of -- he wrote <T_0> for both <T_8> and <T_3> .
<T_4> you sell <T_2> a flat screen television or give <T_1> one as a <T_0> , it will be <T_3> same <T_5> .
<T_0> am in the <T_1> .
and <T_0> could <T_2> in headphones with <T_1> thing called <T_3> recording .
<T_1> &apos;d ransacked , <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_1> , ready , steady , <T_0> !
<T_0> put up a somewhat dour <T_4> , <T_1> a <T_3> happy chimp <T_2> there .
and <T_3> you put <T_4> some randomness , some fluctuations <T_5> some randomness , <T_0> realize <T_2> whole bunch <T_1> different <T_6> .
&quot; reefcity . &quot;
<T_2> are <T_0> the birth of <T_1> new era .
and if <T_1> don &apos;t have <T_7> and humility , then it &apos;s <T_8> really short <T_4> to go from <T_6> to autocrat , and i think you <T_9> have to read &quot; <T_2> farm &quot; to get <T_5> message about <T_3> power <T_0> people .
but <T_1> get <T_6> instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of <T_4> change that go back <T_2> of <T_0> , <T_5> &apos;s a <T_3> diagram .
<T_3> north america in the northern <T_1> of the united states and <T_6> southern plains <T_0> alberta <T_2> saskatchewan , there &apos;s this unit of rock called the hell <T_4> formation that <T_9> the <T_7> dinosaurs that <T_5> on <T_8> .
you don &apos;t have <T_2> that part , <T_1> trust <T_0> .
on <T_5> list it would be stuff like , seeing the <T_7> in the spring , the <T_2> of new-mown hay , catching <T_3> wave and bodysurfing <T_8> <T_1> touch of a <T_6> &apos;s hand , the sound of <T_9> watson playing the guitar , listening to old <T_4> of <T_0> waters and uncle dave macon .
so on <T_4> top-level you have <T_6> overall <T_3> , the <T_1> that might <T_5> out at you from <T_2> fine <T_0> .
all <T_2> can <T_7> you is that <T_4> my <T_6> office in <T_5> and my office <T_9> washington , we &apos;re getting hundreds and <T_3> of calls about the <T_8> ape and gorilla population in <T_1> , but nobody is calling <T_0> the people .
<T_1> can see here a <T_3> bit of heart muscle <T_0> in <T_2> dish .
and <T_0> a few <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> crisis .
and now <T_0> inquest -- you <T_3> , tom &apos;s wife <T_2> dick &apos;s wife <T_1> distraught .
we &apos;re <T_2> to sell <T_1> cars , <T_0> is great .
<T_4> 30 <T_0> a <T_2> dies from <T_3> that <T_1> be <T_5> with tissue regeneration or <T_6> .
because someone at the <T_8> , right -- and <T_0> &apos;t get me wrong <T_9> <T_5> support milk -- but someone <T_1> the milk board probably paid a <T_7> of money for some geezer <T_6> work out that if you put loads of flavorings <T_4> colorings and sugar <T_2> milk , right , more kids will <T_3> it . yeah .
there &apos;s one <T_3> elephant <T_6> the room , <T_7> proteins themselves , <T_8> from <T_5> and bacteria and <T_0> , <T_2> all over <T_4> tree <T_1> life .
<T_1> : that &apos;s <T_0> .
now , this is an <T_5> that <T_2> shot a <T_4> of weeks <T_9> for <T_7> , and you &apos;ll notice , on <T_3> edge <T_0> this image , there &apos;s some <T_6> spots there , which was <T_8> concerning <T_1> me .
i <T_3> the world record <T_2> i wanted to make <T_1> it was <T_0> .
<T_1> are <T_2> problems <T_0> there in the world .
and his <T_0> , <T_1> &apos;s accurate and it &apos;s all to <T_2> .
well <T_0> don &apos;t think <T_1> .
so in <T_1> three <T_2> since <T_3> talked at ted <T_8> showed a <T_0> , <T_6> &apos;s gone <T_7> an idea <T_4> a <T_5> laptop .
so <T_0> next 5,000 <T_2> , <T_3> &apos;s not going to be the <T_1> and only <T_4> .
the answer turns out <T_1> be <T_0> percent .
<T_1> it be <T_2> every man , <T_4> is <T_0> just <T_3> corporations and movie producers ?
so i &apos;ve been talking about this , suggesting , <T_2> , <T_5> mind-wandering <T_1> unhappiness , <T_3> all i &apos;ve really shown <T_0> is that these two things are <T_4> .
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> lot to be <T_6> about , to be <T_4> -- <T_9> environmental crisis , wealth disparity <T_2> this country <T_8> we &apos;ve seen <T_7> 1928 , and <T_5> , a totally immoral <T_3> ongoing wealth disparity .
so if <T_6> can read the <T_4> it &apos;s <T_7> reading your <T_3> , <T_8> you can learn <T_0> history of what happened <T_5> the <T_2> in <T_1> location .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> the forefront of <T_1> mind always .
they did <T_3> pot pie , <T_5> did <T_1> chicken , and <T_0> they finally <T_4> chicken <T_2> .
they are very <T_0> from us in body <T_1> .
<T_4> , the inhabitants created public <T_6> and designed them <T_1> feel <T_3> like <T_5> home <T_2> less like <T_0> unfinished tower .
<T_5> can just see <T_2> little <T_1> of north america up here and <T_0> sliver <T_3> australia down <T_4> .
<T_0> was <T_1> .
that <T_3> can grow up , you know , not so <T_0> circumstances , <T_2> you <T_1> move .
this is <T_6> spa telephone . the <T_7> is that it &apos;s become so difficult to have a private conversation <T_4> that you go to the spa , you have <T_8> massage , you have a <T_1> , maybe a rub , and then you <T_2> this beautiful pool with <T_9> perfect <T_5> , and you <T_0> have this isolation tank phone conversation <T_3> whomever you &apos;ve been wanting to talk with for a long time .
i was <T_3> , &quot; <T_1> cries when <T_0> invite him <T_2> take a walk . &quot;
<T_6> a <T_2> that <T_0> people <T_3> abstain , be faithful , and use condoms -- the abc <T_4> -- <T_8> decreased their prevalence in <T_7> 1990s <T_9> about 15 percent to 6 percent <T_5> just <T_1> few years .
six <T_7> , these folds are now beginning <T_8> the <T_9> on the inside of <T_5> heart actually being able to pull down each one of <T_2> valves in your <T_1> until <T_3> get a mature <T_6> -- and then <T_4> the development of <T_0> entire human body .
checkmate .
now <T_2> has <T_1> very <T_6> bottom line -- <T_5> report <T_3> a set <T_4> shareholders , they have to turn a <T_0> .
<T_4> anti-sandinista guerrilla was <T_0> wounded as <T_2> zero attacked <T_3> town in southern <T_1> .
<T_0> highline <T_1> manhattan <T_2> very similar .
so <T_3> me <T_2> point out : <T_1> are like <T_0> .
<T_1> divide <T_0> farther .
<T_6> know <T_5> what you need to do is <T_1> to <T_8> , even <T_7> difficult , and <T_4> of time <T_9> , <T_2> forget yourself , you feel <T_0> of something <T_3> .
<T_0> at <T_1> green spike in <T_3> to <T_2> bellwether show .
but to <T_2> , they are <T_0> objects to visually narrate a <T_1> .
and <T_3> our <T_1> , <T_0> spend a lot of <T_2> at <T_4> .
and i hope , and one of my biggest <T_4> , is that , <T_8> our growing <T_7> about the <T_2> of <T_6> and <T_3> relationship with <T_0> rest of the animal world , that we &apos;ll give them the <T_5> and <T_1> that <T_9> deserve .
life <T_3> introduced <T_0> of people <T_2> distant , far-off cultures they never <T_1> existed through pictures .
when he says , &quot; i <T_7> the spirit , and <T_6> am the way , &quot; and when the prophet muhammad said , &quot; whoever <T_2> seen me has seen god , &quot; it is because they became so <T_1> an instrument of <T_0> , they <T_3> part of god &apos;s team -- so that god &apos;s <T_8> was manifest through <T_5> , and they were not acting from their <T_4> selves and their own <T_9> .
i <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
&quot; if we accept the theory of <T_8> , <T_0> the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist <T_9> the <T_2> of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world , or between the non-living and <T_5> world , <T_4> which possess <T_1> some of the <T_3> attributes of life &quot; -- so , the ones <T_6> just discussed -- &quot; to which <T_7> attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment . &quot;
there &apos;s no molecular <T_2> , there &apos;s no sequencing <T_1> genes that was referred to <T_3> , there &apos;s no fancy <T_0> at the <T_4> .
<T_1> get <T_4> star to form , you need <T_3> big <T_2> of <T_0> and <T_5> .
and he was <T_1> first <T_9> his <T_6> , who <T_0> hardly knew , <T_5> had died , <T_8> then <T_2> his <T_3> , <T_4> he did know , <T_7> is still alive .

but contained inside <T_1> documents <T_2> a new <T_5> , <T_6> language <T_7> understand one of <T_4> most fundamental <T_3> of science -- namely <T_0> .
and <T_4> happens <T_1> that , at first , <T_2> start off <T_0> cooperative -- and <T_3> is all played <T_5> .
<T_8> is a <T_0> by the <T_2> michael <T_4> , and <T_1> &apos;s <T_7> , in the sense <T_3> he went there <T_6> argentina <T_5> take the photo .
let me do <T_5> last thing <T_1> hadn &apos;t thought i &apos;d <T_0> time to do , which is to talk about <T_2> we learned , more generally , about <T_4> from the <T_3> of the gang .
i <T_0> so inspired .
well , what <T_0> 10 ^ <T_1> ?
you go <T_2> the bars <T_3> sardinia , <T_1> of seeing <T_0> sports <T_4> swimsuit calendar , you see the centenarian of the month calendar .
and <T_1> can <T_6> this looks a <T_2> like a <T_3> &apos;s hat , but actually <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> assault , the one <T_0> blue .
and <T_2> responded <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;m <T_3> . &quot;
<T_0> &apos;m <T_4> , <T_3> i &apos;m jewish in the same <T_5> the <T_2> garden is <T_1> .
but i <T_1> to argue , <T_3> all , a big-picture positive <T_2> this <T_0> .
speaking of <T_1> , there <T_3> currently <T_0> billion <T_2> us on earth .
<T_2> &apos;s take a <T_1> example of the dispute about <T_0> .
every <T_0> thing creates <T_1> new questions <T_3> two <T_2> opportunities .
what <T_1> they say <T_3> they were cutting down <T_2> last <T_0> tree ?
i was very <T_0> of this <T_4> because <T_3> &apos;s the <T_2> massive <T_6> complex <T_5> found on my own that <T_1> abandoned .
so it was a <T_2> , you <T_4> , it all <T_0> in <T_1> two <T_3> .
<T_1> there &apos;s also <T_0> downside to this -- a kind of <T_5> side , in <T_6> -- and that <T_8> that the more tightly <T_2> we &apos;ve become to <T_7> other , <T_3> harder it is for each of us <T_4> remain independent .
<T_1> are wrapping <T_0> .
<T_0> are big picture schools <T_1> the u.s. and <T_2> .
somebody <T_1> is in <T_0> ahead of <T_2> .
and <T_2> is <T_1> science <T_0> .
and <T_7> definitely reduce <T_1> hostility <T_8> the &quot; i <T_9> &apos;t want to be <T_2> to them &quot; to the <T_0> we think of as <T_5> bad <T_3> , the ones we hate <T_6> we don &apos;t <T_4> .
because &#91; if &#93; to have <T_3> best <T_8> , you really <T_9> the most <T_4> care <T_1> the country , or in the <T_5> , well <T_0> we <T_7> would be talking about rationing <T_2> we &apos;re going to <T_6> off from medicare .
their <T_1> is always about <T_0> consequences .
i <T_0> , <T_1> , i <T_2> claim the <T_3> .
<T_8> . i think <T_4> actual answer <T_7> that once you reframe it , once <T_6> get out of one set of stale expectations from a <T_0> project that had its day , but now , for whatever reason , is <T_9> , <T_3> can actually rekindle the <T_1> of human kindness and sharing that something like <T_5> on <T_2> represents .
<T_3> , <T_0> has a profound <T_1> on creative problem-solving and deep <T_2> processing .
<T_0> know , it &apos;s a <T_5> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> pry bar , <T_6> &apos;s a screwdriver <T_2> it &apos;s a <T_4> .
the <T_1> teachers weren &apos;t having much <T_0> , <T_4> sports <T_3> very dirty <T_2> very painful .

<T_0> eventually made <T_1> to hawaii <T_2> alive .
it is <T_2> only <T_3> you can start to <T_0> cancer , is by <T_1> it <T_4> .
just <T_0> blobs of <T_1> , again .
and puzzling <T_0> is .

alex <T_0> : how ideas <T_1> crises
but , <T_4> , even <T_0> we were <T_5> steroid-filled <T_2> players , <T_1> answer is <T_3> .
<T_5> &apos;s this <T_0> , <T_6> militarization of the <T_2> , <T_4> it &apos;s <T_3> right <T_1> the united states .
this <T_7> the first <T_3> of a high school in <T_6> -- well , <T_0> it <T_4> , a <T_1> , a conceptual , <T_5> of <T_2> .
politicians <T_1> a <T_3> , <T_2> , <T_0> i.t. project ?

and <T_4> doyle , writing <T_2> bell , described <T_3> following <T_0> between <T_1> and his <T_5> .
and <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> direct result of eating a <T_0> diet .
in <T_2> , i <T_0> fortunate enough to get <T_3> to these <T_1> closed-circuit <T_4> .
<T_0> can really see <T_1> details of the data set .
<T_6> is one of my <T_1> , because <T_3> was taken on tuesday <T_4> when <T_2> asked <T_5> to go <T_0> the polls .
but then , <T_0> i thought about it <T_2> that , <T_3> was very <T_1> things .
it doesn &apos;t <T_6> what your <T_4> is ; even <T_0> you &apos;re an <T_7> , you don &apos;t raise <T_3> kid telling <T_5> , you know , &quot; make sure you lie <T_2> times a <T_1> . &quot;
booted up in <T_1> cell , <T_4> program would execute , and it <T_0> result in this person ; or with <T_5> small change , it could result <T_9> this person ; or another small <T_7> , this person ; <T_2> with <T_8> larger change , this <T_6> , or <T_3> tree , or this whale .
<T_3> she had <T_0> to washington , <T_2> seeking a handout <T_1> not seeking a <T_4> .
<T_2> or less <T_1> . so , if you &apos;re in <T_0> tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to <T_3> down .
<T_2> they &apos;ve aged <T_6> of that <T_7> , but <T_5> &apos;s still <T_4> case that <T_9> ratings companies like <T_0> don &apos;t even take <T_1> account <T_3> shows over age 54 . <T_8>
<T_1> this was the thinking <T_2> then , and <T_3> individuals made these <T_0> .
and <T_5> were <T_1> of passengers on <T_6> ship , and <T_3> were getting <T_7> , <T_2> the captain invited them <T_4> the <T_0> .
<T_2> saw <T_0> the front <T_4> of <T_1> wars are not on isolated <T_5> , <T_6> right where people <T_3> .
<T_4> &apos;s essentially <T_0> fundamental <T_2> in our <T_5> with stuff , with the <T_1> in <T_3> lives .
according <T_0> fao , <T_2> we don &apos;t change <T_3> system <T_4> fishing <T_1> main sea resources will be gone in 2050 .
<T_6> i know it says <T_3> , and <T_2> is <T_4> , but i have <T_1> couple <T_0> if <T_5> want it .
if you think of <T_0> great <T_9> , <T_1> the cathedrals , of the <T_6> , of the <T_8> , <T_2> pagodas , of <T_7> in india and beyond , <T_5> think of how incredible <T_4> is that that was realized not by some <T_3> idea , but by people .
they <T_0> near <T_2> . <T_1> at these <T_3> boats .
this <T_0> a <T_1> between <T_2> and don .
and now <T_0> one <T_4> the <T_2> surround looks <T_1> than the one on <T_5> light <T_3> .
so <T_5> don &apos;t want somebody <T_6> &apos;s saying , &quot; <T_3> , <T_7> &apos;ve got a <T_2> idea in <T_4> business i <T_1> nothing <T_0> .
<T_0> : <T_1> .
so we started by <T_1> a <T_3> , <T_0> organization <T_4> mtts <T_5> vietnam , <T_6> manufactures newborn care technologies <T_2> southeast asia .
<T_3> that i &apos;ve done that -- <T_4> &apos;ll explain <T_2> in a moment -- <T_0> must <T_5> you <T_6> i am <T_1> actor .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_3> they <T_1> access to <T_2> culture .
but <T_1> can never have <T_2> eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp <T_0> .
the key is that civil gps signals are <T_0> open .
<T_9> look <T_6> . <T_2> of <T_4> tanks and coming up <T_1> without thinking <T_3> it , it &apos;s a <T_7> bit of back pressure , and that sub just <T_5> straight back up <T_8> of the <T_0> .
we have <T_1> a <T_2> of very nice , smart <T_0> .
any <T_0> ? any <T_2> ? <T_3> . thank you . <T_1> you .
where <T_3> it go ? <T_4> miles <T_0> plate , right down <T_2> the <T_1> .
<T_6> people <T_2> they know <T_4> origami <T_3> . it &apos;s this : <T_1> birds , <T_0> , cootie catchers , that <T_5> of thing .
<T_1> don &apos;t give <T_3> five options on the <T_0> , <T_2> ?
thank you .
and <T_4> could still hold his <T_0> &apos;s <T_5> , but <T_1> couldn &apos;t do buttons on his <T_2> , can &apos;t <T_3> himself .
<T_3> smartest one , first <T_0> come <T_2> , <T_4> the mtn <T_1> of <T_5> .
now a <T_5> in , <T_7> other two or three hundred <T_4> that are all <T_2> , partly as a <T_9> of temperature , <T_6> as a <T_8> of all the other <T_0> , <T_1> you &apos;ve got a really complicated <T_3> .
the <T_1> , <T_2> , has been acting like <T_0> .
<T_3> fourth <T_2> on my checklist is <T_1> with hostile <T_0> .
and in order <T_0> understand it , <T_4> we want <T_2> see is the way , in this <T_5> kind <T_1> language , there is new <T_3> coming up .
i &apos;m just going to <T_4> on a <T_0> of them , and let &apos;s start <T_2> fire , <T_5> i think <T_3> is probably the <T_1> one that you &apos;re all thinking about right now .
<T_8> field studies to <T_9> studies , we see that <T_5> or <T_2> an <T_3> , gaining <T_7> losing a romantic partner , getting or <T_0> getting a promotion , passing or not passing <T_4> college test , on and on , have far less <T_6> , less intensity and much less duration than people <T_1> them to have .
<T_1> don &apos;t <T_0> fade in and <T_2> .
<T_3> narrative here <T_1> real fmri <T_2> that &apos;s mapped visually <T_0> sonically .
so <T_1> didn &apos;t get caught <T_0> time .
that <T_0> john kerry &apos;s home state .
<T_2> was <T_1> tradition i <T_0> to follow .
<T_5> our <T_1> is too <T_3> , if the pilot <T_0> energy , <T_6> &apos;ll never make it <T_2> the <T_4> .
<T_0> you <T_1> what ?
<T_5> problem is <T_2> these <T_3> need a stable <T_0> of solid ice <T_4> order to nurse <T_1> their moms .
<T_2> -- <T_0> as the <T_1> gets brighter <T_3> go a little deeper , little deeper .
<T_1> &apos;s a <T_2> of a <T_0> girl <T_3> .
<T_0> are the faces <T_2> the children <T_4> i have <T_5> with <T_1> just like <T_3> .
<T_5> , i am lucky <T_1> live in history <T_4> , because without intelligence <T_2> memory there <T_3> no <T_0> .
i <T_1> lived in the rape <T_2> of the <T_0> for the <T_3> 12 <T_4> .
<T_2> b was <T_1> heard <T_7> in <T_6> pope &apos;s library about a <T_3> miles <T_4> of <T_5> in viterbo <T_0> 1311 .
<T_6> , <T_5> asked half <T_0> people to recall either 10 books they read <T_4> high school , or to recall <T_2> ten commandments , and then <T_3> tempted them with <T_1> .
<T_2> he <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> is <T_1> shortest distance between <T_4> points . &quot;
he <T_1> at the rich man . <T_3> held the rich man &apos;s hands <T_2> said , &quot; don &apos;t you understand ? &quot; he said , &quot; these <T_0> the hands of <T_4> . &quot;
and <T_0> feeling <T_6> led me to a pilgrimage of sorts , to go literally <T_5> the ends of the <T_2> to see <T_8> , <T_9> , <T_7> that <T_3> are building , <T_1> have built , in <T_4> to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail .
<T_2> what i would like to maybe <T_0> you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today , <T_9> two reasons . one : so that <T_8> can contribute more . <T_4> two : so that hopefully <T_6> can not just understand <T_5> people more , <T_3> maybe appreciate them more , <T_7> create the <T_1> of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face in our society today .
well <T_0> characters , <T_5> the ones <T_6> my <T_4> , <T_2> me to play with <T_1> spaces between <T_3> questions .
<T_0> did <T_1> die ?
<T_6> marx <T_5> this <T_4> the tragedy of <T_3> , the <T_2> of the worker <T_0> the product of his <T_1> .
they &apos;re <T_3> to <T_2> , and <T_0> sky is really <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
it <T_0> a <T_1> state <T_2> everything that is <T_4> , including <T_3> .
and he <T_3> to understand what <T_5> was <T_1> why <T_0> was that there <T_4> this funny <T_2> .
<T_1> is about <T_7> working together , and <T_3> i <T_5> need to say that <T_2> the vehicle we have quite <T_6> territories , <T_0> and <T_4> .
i <T_1> they were <T_0> , <T_2> not <T_3> close .
so , as you <T_0> , <T_3> care about harm <T_1> care <T_2> .
<T_3> globalization <T_0> power -- we <T_2> about the globalization <T_4> markets , <T_6> actually it &apos;s <T_1> globalization of <T_5> power .
<T_0> that &apos;s not the <T_2> place <T_1> &apos;s found .
so <T_1> bee <T_2> builds upon the resource in which <T_3> people are <T_0> .
we <T_6> turn them down <T_8> they are <T_7> , if <T_3> &apos;re causing trouble , trouble that is felt <T_5> the brain , or we can <T_4> them up if they are underperforming , and in so <T_2> , we <T_0> that we may be <T_9> to help the <T_1> function of the brain .
<T_0> is no <T_1> there .
now , this <T_8> is <T_7> , <T_1> that &apos;s <T_0> color <T_2> most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution <T_6> selected for the color <T_3> travels <T_5> through <T_9> in <T_4> to optimize communication .
<T_2> walked <T_1> this <T_3> and <T_5> was <T_4> of people <T_0> me . <T_6> who couldn &apos;t sit still .
<T_1> , i &apos;m just <T_0> .
now , you <T_0> a <T_1> .
i <T_7> &apos;t go into the <T_8> of why <T_9> think the <T_5> is like this , but <T_3> comes out <T_6> the <T_0> and trying <T_2> explain <T_4> physics that we <T_1> .
i &apos;ll follow the <T_0> . &quot;
<T_2> the <T_4> is , when <T_3> have advanced <T_7> , <T_1> can &apos;t do that <T_6> today about it , <T_5> the statistics <T_0> to .
<T_0> do <T_2> get it <T_1> mars ?
i <T_3> on the mayor &apos;s council in san <T_6> , on the international design <T_0> for mayors , <T_4> chicago is looked at <T_8> the <T_7> , and i really would like <T_5> salute <T_2> daley <T_9> the <T_1> there .
time-warping <T_1> challenges <T_9> deepest core , because <T_5> are able to <T_0> the past <T_2> some of it <T_8> hard <T_3> forget , even as <T_6> current <T_7> is increasingly <T_4> .
in-group , <T_2> , <T_5> -- this stuff <T_1> nothing <T_6> do <T_0> morality . <T_3> reject <T_4> . &quot;
i said , these kids <T_0> different .
<T_4> it works <T_5> on <T_1> test range , and it indeed folds <T_2> into <T_3> neat little <T_0> .
this <T_1> cueva de <T_5> in <T_2> , in <T_0> , and <T_4> cave is saturated with <T_3> acid .
there is <T_1> way back <T_0> .
thank <T_0> !
our <T_3> defy <T_4> binary <T_2> of how we <T_0> often describe <T_1> young .
<T_0> the <T_2> were super <T_1> .
there <T_1> 10,000 <T_3> of <T_0> that taxonomists -- people who <T_4> and <T_2> animals -- have <T_5> .
<T_1> this is <T_0> you <T_2> in .
well <T_1> 25 years i was <T_5> putting out pieces of <T_2> romance and not getting a lot <T_6> in <T_9> design <T_8> call doesn &apos;t always connect you with <T_3> circumstance <T_7> which you <T_4> produce <T_0> of this nature .
they <T_1> &apos;t wear <T_0> . &quot;
<T_3> &apos;s a lot more <T_6> like <T_7> -- <T_2> , <T_4> -- <T_1> can just see <T_8> &apos;re getting <T_5> , <T_0> at the very name of these things .
you <T_1> walk through . you <T_0> touch .
these clouds spread out <T_0> the <T_4> in this enormous <T_3> fashion stretching <T_5> miles <T_2> into the <T_1> .
and <T_0> was coming every <T_1> .
everything is <T_1> on <T_0> computers <T_2> .
<T_1> many <T_4> parks , <T_0> can pay extra to <T_2> to the <T_3> of the <T_5> .
<T_2> take <T_0> particles . you <T_1> them together .
<T_3> , should we <T_1> ask , &quot; <T_0> anything <T_2> newspapers ? &quot;
<T_2> are going to <T_5> towards the vanishing point <T_0> the <T_3> , and i <T_1> you to <T_4> two things .
it <T_5> a phenomenon where <T_0> brides were committing suicide <T_2> rural gujarat , because <T_4> were being forced to <T_1> more and <T_3> money for <T_6> in-laws &apos; families .
<T_6> of the western <T_1> begin <T_0> the <T_2> of <T_7> , and descend <T_5> a kind of profligate <T_3> to a <T_4> ugly future .
and we can rotate <T_2> charge space <T_0> four <T_3> to <T_4> a <T_6> look at the strong <T_5> , <T_7> has this nice <T_1> symmetry .
<T_2> , by the way is <T_3> wehbe . <T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> pop star <T_4> pan-arab pin-up girl .
<T_4> &apos;s also more <T_3> known as the <T_1> mushroom <T_7> the &quot; humongous fungus &quot; because <T_0> happens to be one <T_2> the <T_6> &apos;s largest <T_5> as well .
<T_2> know <T_4> answer <T_0> this , <T_3> how do you <T_1> ?
<T_1> now , <T_7> contrast to the <T_4> , you can <T_0> place the needle <T_6> your <T_9> , <T_8> you <T_5> pass it all <T_2> way through <T_3> follow it in a trajectory .
one <T_1> is they are always <T_2> india with <T_0> .
and <T_9> ends <T_6> a little <T_2> of my <T_8> , of <T_5> , talking <T_4> something <T_0> is very <T_1> to him , which is <T_3> accidents of <T_7> .
now <T_1> know what some <T_0> you are <T_2> .
i <T_5> a wonderful <T_2> with cathay <T_4> airlines for <T_0> years , where they gave me <T_3> passes on <T_7> their <T_6> in return <T_1> photography .
<T_2> year a <T_3> and a half people <T_1> of a <T_0> preventable <T_4> . that &apos;s malaria . 6,000 <T_5> a <T_6> .
this is what <T_1> us the <T_0> image .
<T_2> i want <T_0> begin with a <T_4> of an <T_3> and terrible <T_1> .
<T_1> say <T_3> myself , &quot; what <T_2> do <T_0> come from ? &quot;
so <T_8> we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral-sized pieces , we <T_3> , we at least <T_0> the means then <T_1> try and make serially lots of these <T_5> to be <T_7> to eventually <T_9> them together <T_2> make this <T_4> base <T_6> .
and so , that &apos;s an amazing <T_0> to <T_1> .
<T_7> then went <T_4> the tv <T_1> , that said if you had <T_0> big enough <T_6> , if you could get on tv <T_2> times , if you could <T_5> enough ads , you <T_3> win .
<T_2> now , <T_4> generation 20 , it actually <T_3> in a <T_0> line <T_1> falling over .
put <T_0> back .
its characters are <T_8> , <T_0> and other geometrical <T_7> , <T_3> which it is <T_1> impossible to <T_4> a <T_6> word <T_9> it ; <T_5> these , one is wandering around in <T_2> dark labyrinth . &quot;
<T_1> the <T_0> .
well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by <T_5> ways in which <T_0> can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them <T_8> , but most of all , <T_7> by crates <T_6> mail <T_1> this one , my trusty mail crate , filled <T_4> the scriptings of ordinary <T_2> , strangers writing <T_3> to other strangers not because <T_9> &apos;re ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
<T_0> changed <T_1> opinion , and <T_2> ?
<T_0> businesses are doable <T_1>
<T_2> was building <T_5> machine <T_9> mathematics , <T_8> lovelace said , &quot; you could do more <T_0> mathematics <T_6> this machine . &quot; <T_4> just as you do , everyone <T_7> this room already &apos;s got <T_1> computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a <T_3> .
and i <T_0> , <T_1> .
we <T_0> take these markers and we can inject them <T_2> a <T_1> site .
and <T_1> &apos;re going to have to <T_5> to <T_8> with the fact <T_6> there are <T_2> between us as <T_7> that <T_3> will know about , and <T_4> subpopulations <T_0> humans as well .
one <T_0> out of 20,000 , and look <T_1> it . <T_2>
and <T_4> of the <T_1> things about <T_0> is <T_5> we <T_2> we <T_3> what it <T_6> .
<T_1> , after a <T_0> weeks , <T_2> set up <T_3> .
<T_3> people <T_0> very <T_2> to ideas , and <T_1> so .
this <T_0> the first flying <T_2> . this was the <T_1> prototype .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_5> classic gamma retrovirus , but <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> new ; <T_3> one &apos;s <T_2> seen it before .
<T_7> are by <T_4> simple , standard test : in the <T_9> of the <T_3> , does it have <T_2> and cold water , <T_5> taps that work , <T_6> shower rose to get water onto <T_8> head or onto your body , <T_0> a drain <T_1> takes the water away ?
all right , so <T_7> want <T_4> to take <T_5> moment , and i <T_1> you <T_6> think <T_2> three <T_8> that you <T_0> to be <T_3> .
<T_1> kosovo <T_0> independent .
and <T_4> you were supposed to <T_2> , what <T_1> hoped to <T_5> in some <T_0> way , <T_3> no <T_6> there .
so this is <T_4> i was talking about , while <T_5> , it &apos;s <T_1> a great <T_9> , because we have freedom of <T_3> walking , or moving my hand or , moving around in the space , but the <T_2> this becomes solid , when you <T_8> move even an inch , because this is plaster of paris , so the moment you pour it it &apos;s <T_6> liquid ; but after 20 <T_7> , it &apos;s almost like a hard <T_0> .
<T_3> march 14 , this <T_2> , i <T_1> this <T_0> on facebook .
<T_1> was <T_0> the <T_2> .
<T_5> a child <T_0> young <T_4> tender , <T_3> i <T_1> &apos;t <T_2> i still remember .
<T_1> got killed , and <T_0> did it without <T_2> .
<T_2> i said , &quot; <T_3> &apos;ve got <T_5> list <T_1> psychopathic <T_4> in <T_0> pocket .
it &apos;s the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally <T_4> little <T_6> and pieces , <T_0> give them one profile <T_1> avatar <T_9> is constantly <T_3> in <T_8> , tiny , tiny <T_2> increments which they <T_5> are their <T_7> .
and <T_6> then went back , <T_5> completely reformulated <T_3> spaghetti sauce , and came out with <T_1> line <T_7> extra chunky that <T_4> and <T_0> took over the spaghetti sauce business in <T_2> country .
so <T_2> &apos;s how <T_0> answer that <T_1> .
main result is <T_1> there <T_2> tremendous <T_0> .
<T_0> that &apos;s <T_1> the <T_2> .
okay , now getting to a part -- i want to show <T_3> in illusions . i <T_2> that <T_5> first example of illusions being used purposely was by da <T_9> in this <T_7> of an eye . so that when you saw from one little angle was like <T_4> . and this <T_6> technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century <T_1> disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip <T_8> image and see it from one little point of view <T_0> this .
<T_1> , they return <T_2> baseline a <T_0> sooner .
ninety-eight percent of <T_0> really thought this just <T_2> have been <T_1> practice , <T_4> that this is how <T_3> should work .
and <T_9> has become part of our toolkit where the activities are in the data , and with it , <T_1> the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could <T_8> our <T_7> efforts , all of the <T_4> environment around my <T_6> -- <T_2> of the words that he heard from myself , <T_3> wife , our nanny , and over time , the <T_5> he began to <T_0> .
the bubbles <T_0> the <T_1> .
what africans practiced <T_4> a <T_6> form of capitalism , <T_7> then after independence , all of a sudden , <T_9> , capitalism <T_0> a <T_2> institution , <T_3> the leaders <T_1> africans <T_5> ready for <T_8> .
neither <T_2> has any incentive <T_4> solve it <T_0> second before it &apos;s due , so he said , december , you &apos;re just going to see <T_7> of angry negotiations , negotiations breaking apart , reports of phone <T_1> that aren &apos;t going well , <T_8> saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and <T_9> sometime <T_6> christmas <T_5> new year &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; okay , <T_3> resolved everything . &quot;
but <T_0> is <T_1> world we have <T_3> , <T_2> longer any gap .
do <T_0> remember <T_1> wrestler andré <T_2> giant ?
we <T_2> say to our <T_4> , ok , <T_3> , <T_5> was our <T_1> . <T_0> passed .
<T_3> bill <T_1> , as he was staring out at <T_7> audience , he said , &quot; <T_5> you &apos;re not <T_6> utilizing <T_9> the <T_0> in your country , there is <T_8> way you <T_4> get anywhere near the <T_2> 10 . &quot;
and the <T_4> about bayesian <T_5> is it <T_6> you the mathematics of <T_8> optimal <T_2> to combine your prior knowledge with <T_7> sensory <T_0> to <T_1> new <T_3> .
<T_9> it <T_7> fuzzy <T_3> walking across <T_5> stomach , and mount <T_6> and mount <T_0> were <T_2> of right <T_8> the <T_1> , that were also <T_4> .
<T_0> office of the <T_1> .
i <T_2> i <T_0> want to recapitulate and <T_3> this is <T_1> .
i think that if we <T_1> our <T_8> limitations in the <T_7> way that we understand <T_0> physical limitations , <T_3> though <T_6> don &apos;t stare us in the <T_9> in the <T_5> way , we <T_4> design a <T_2> world .
<T_4> it doesn &apos;t sound <T_2> much , <T_6> &apos;s not relatively <T_1> , <T_7> won &apos;t make a <T_3> if you &apos;ve already <T_0> 100,000 <T_5> previously .
so <T_0> would think that <T_1> was low-fat ?
and <T_4> i asked <T_2> of the <T_1> about the shock and <T_5> response , <T_0> said , &quot; don &apos;t <T_7> , <T_3> thing back <T_6> .
<T_4> this , we &apos;re <T_0> a <T_3> , a <T_2> person <T_5> using <T_1> airpix .
and <T_1> go , &quot; <T_2> , it &apos;s the <T_0> . it &apos;s basically the <T_3> . &quot;
now , that <T_2> my first <T_0> . <T_3> got <T_1> .
<T_3> -- <T_6> other thing <T_0> i <T_2> i &apos;d like to <T_4> about is right <T_5> here . <T_1> over here .
all <T_1> could do was <T_5> a <T_0> abbreviation in <T_3> language <T_2> didn &apos;t even <T_4> .
<T_1> , <T_3> of through <T_4> lens of a genome , <T_5> the lens of digitized <T_0> of the <T_2> record .
<T_2> , see , <T_3> &apos;s because <T_1> bottles <T_0> solid .
<T_1> it &apos;s <T_0> for the <T_2> family .
<T_1> you know which drivers you need to <T_0> to get out of the <T_2> .
it is <T_4> professor <T_2> convict , it is <T_0> two <T_1> ready <T_3> do philosophy .
<T_0> vucinic : <T_2> &apos;s a great <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;t it ?
and <T_0> are <T_1> going to <T_2> ?
<T_1> they &apos;re <T_2> to <T_0> that .
so we <T_2> with them prototyping <T_4> really <T_3> things that we could <T_1> to have <T_0> huge amount of <T_5> .
<T_2> we really set out on <T_0> path to try and make <T_3> lowest <T_1> possible .
<T_3> you believe in <T_0> , but <T_1> in <T_2> .
in <T_3> meanwhile , the old mentality <T_4> a capital o , was represented <T_6> his <T_9> , <T_7> head of the <T_5> bank , <T_2> the cia that <T_8> own son was about to attack , and this <T_1> fell <T_0> deaf ears .
and so , i <T_0> able to put <T_3> into <T_6> story , <T_7> is an <T_2> , and <T_4> go on <T_5> something <T_1> .
<T_1> worry about overpopulation ; <T_8> say , &quot; <T_3> , if <T_0> fix aging , no one &apos;s going to <T_7> to speak of , <T_5> at least the death toll is going to be much <T_6> , <T_2> from <T_9> st. <T_4> carelessly .
the <T_0> turns into a stable <T_3> , which <T_4> filtration <T_1> the water systems , <T_7> exposing the very <T_2> birds <T_6> would carry flu and <T_9> them a chance <T_5> breed resistant <T_8> .
in <T_2> process , <T_3> will gain about <T_0> million <T_1> jobs , mainly <T_4> .
<T_5> &apos;re <T_4> used to it , and <T_1> see <T_3> as <T_0> organisms that <T_6> very different from <T_2> .
<T_2> basically , <T_1> of all ages , <T_0> us .
<T_0> yet , <T_1> never happens .
so , thank you very much , evan . ew : thank you .
so perhaps <T_0> dopamine is <T_1> to more <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> delta , <T_0> fact , between <T_2> we &apos;re willing to <T_4> .
if you &apos;ve been in a <T_0> kitchen , you &apos;ve seen <T_2> food , water and <T_1> can be wasted there . chef arthur <T_4> shares his <T_7> personal vision <T_9> drastically reducing <T_5> , and <T_3> , waste <T_8> creating recycling , composting , sustainable engines for <T_6> .
well , we &apos;ve <T_0> to see the <T_1> in terms of ngos , in terms of <T_2> .
<T_5> then by the <T_1> of the <T_2> , <T_4> country had <T_0> back into political instability and <T_3> .
perhaps the <T_1> existed before the bang , and <T_0> bang <T_5> just a <T_4> event <T_2> a pre-existing <T_3> .
<T_7> are <T_1> , <T_5> to , <T_8> , marketed , but <T_4> letter <T_0> actually <T_2> of the <T_3> times that we have <T_6> communication .
<T_1> start at <T_2> bottom , and say <T_3> outcomes do <T_0> want , and then <T_5> a <T_6> to have <T_7> desired <T_4> .
<T_7> now , using <T_4> joystick , they can send this <T_0> around <T_3> lab <T_1> control <T_8> it goes <T_5> or <T_2> , forwards <T_6> backwards .
in <T_1> , <T_2> picture is <T_0> different .
and that <T_2> of <T_9> on the existing <T_4> is one that is characteristic <T_6> the blogosphere , particularly <T_5> the <T_1> blogosphere , and it <T_3> one that essentially throws off this <T_0> , <T_8> , bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the <T_7> conditions .
<T_1> a little <T_3> . which leads <T_7> to the <T_0> thing , which <T_5> -- what have i got <T_6> ? <T_4> . all <T_2> .
so , now we <T_4> a <T_2> -- an acting <T_3> -- that was <T_1> part <T_0> the group .
so if i take this salt dough , again , it &apos;s <T_2> the play-dough you <T_7> made as kids , <T_5> i plug it <T_9> -- it &apos;s <T_8> two-lead battery pack , simple battery pack , <T_6> can buy them at <T_1> shack and pretty much anywhere else -- <T_4> can actually <T_0> light <T_3> up .
but <T_1> 300 <T_2> people in <T_0> u.s .
<T_0> : eight . <T_1> .
daylight , <T_1> could <T_2> it , <T_0> .
<T_4> he shows <T_6> on their <T_2> , <T_7> doorstep , with a <T_0> and pajamas , and <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> to spend the <T_8> with <T_1> .
<T_4> if <T_1> text now , or if you are <T_3> who is <T_5> of the <T_8> the way it &apos;s become , you &apos;ll notice <T_6> lol does <T_7> mean <T_2> out loud <T_0> .
<T_0> would be their <T_1> .
and <T_0> ... <T_3> luck with <T_2> one in the <T_1> translation room .
<T_7> years ago , <T_6> i began <T_0> the ocean , no one -- not jacques <T_4> , <T_2> jacques <T_1> or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything <T_8> harm <T_3> ocean <T_5> what we put into <T_9> or by what we took out of it .
there &apos;s two <T_0> you can do to <T_7> stop <T_2> -- <T_8> simple thing <T_3> a complicated <T_4> , <T_5> easy <T_6> and a <T_1> thing .
how <T_1> we figure <T_0> out ?
<T_2> we looked <T_0> that -- <T_3> was a <T_1> chemistry set .
the <T_0> movement is called <T_1> .
they also get <T_1> land in <T_0> the <T_4> , <T_2> they can grow their <T_3> .
<T_2> of course , <T_4> child mortality is <T_1> matter of <T_3> importance from <T_0> aspects .
<T_0> looks <T_2> . is it <T_1> little hot <T_3> ?
<T_0> contractors , <T_1> don &apos;t like that .
do you <T_1> wonder <T_0> happens to <T_2> stuff ?
<T_2> like <T_0> , these <T_1> all this <T_3> .
<T_2> can <T_0> make them , quote , &quot; pirates . &quot; <T_3> is <T_1> good ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_7> . i <T_8> from <T_5> place <T_6> kids can buy 35 <T_3> of blunt <T_9> at any day of the moment , <T_0> ice cream freezers are filled <T_1> slushy malt <T_4> .
<T_1> you do <T_5> , <T_0> -- <T_2> i just-- you know , <T_7> do <T_8> , <T_4> you write down things <T_3> , you <T_6> observations , you know .
and <T_2> &apos;ve put <T_1> formula <T_0> there .
so i think it <T_3> us <T_4> we &apos;ve designed this <T_0> to <T_2> us to this new <T_1> , <T_5> .
<T_0> i &apos;m thinking , <T_2> , <T_3> is not <T_1> .
&quot; <T_3> &quot; started <T_2> debate <T_0> criminality <T_1> .
but , actually , it &apos;s <T_4> come to me after years working in the business , that <T_0> we create in advertising , <T_8> is intangible <T_6> -- <T_7> might call <T_5> perceived value , you might call it <T_9> value , <T_3> value , intangible value <T_1> some kind -- gets rather <T_2> bad rap .
it <T_2> of with the <T_1> small ones , which <T_4> one <T_0> , four <T_6> -- <T_5> &apos;s <T_7> -- <T_3> just floats off .
<T_0> of all , you have to <T_1> ruthlessly .
for example , true story : <T_0> a few <T_3> ago , this <T_9> , upon finding out that a friend <T_4> i were in town <T_2> a game developer &apos;s conference , turned around and said -- and i quote -- &quot; i <T_7> games . <T_8> of life . imagine getting <T_6> the end of your life and <T_1> all that <T_5> . &quot;
basically , it <T_2> a <T_1> years <T_3> have life on <T_0> .
<T_8> we <T_0> eventually <T_7> a chunk of the <T_5> -- <T_3> virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take <T_4> 100 <T_6> years to <T_2> there , <T_1> if we go <T_9> we never will .
he will <T_4> and <T_0> his <T_3> to spread <T_1> urine around and make <T_2> more attractive .
you can <T_6> the <T_9> of pathogens off the internet <T_4> you <T_7> to , and clearly someone recently -- <T_1> saw <T_5> a science magazine -- they <T_2> , well , the 1918 <T_3> is <T_8> dangerous <T_0> fedex around .
<T_0> this <T_2> condition <T_1> called the sisyphic condition .
<T_1> think <T_2> a moment what <T_0> means .
you &apos;re watching <T_0> video .
<T_1> not personal <T_0> ?
just buy <T_8> software , you design it . i <T_0> &apos;t say anymore , you can take <T_3> on from there . it &apos;s going to <T_9> , <T_1> i think it <T_5> to happen before <T_7> technology becomes natural , <T_4> part of the <T_2> condition , something that <T_6> &apos;s familiar with and everybody accepts .
one of the <T_1> things about <T_0> camel &apos;s <T_4> design <T_2> that <T_5> penis <T_3> backwards .
<T_1> : <T_0> you .
<T_2> that might be <T_1> chance of actually <T_0> life when <T_4> cannot <T_3> see it .
a lot of <T_1> won &apos;t <T_3> them , or stop taking <T_2> , because of <T_0> unpleasant side effects .
<T_5> they &apos;re doing <T_1> pretty <T_7> job there in the forest , working all the byproduct <T_9> their industry -- <T_4> osb and <T_0> and so <T_6> and so on -- but it does <T_3> good to <T_8> responsible at the point of harvest in the forest <T_2> consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
and <T_1> is the idea that <T_0> magazine <T_2> on their front cover .
<T_1> i said , &quot; do you <T_0> ? &quot;
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> huge amount <T_0> data .
and so he <T_0> up with this <T_8> , and <T_2> said , <T_6> will be cool , because it &apos;ll be <T_5> longer growing season in sweden , you know , and the surfers liked <T_3> , the <T_7> thought , that &apos;s a <T_1> idea , because it &apos;s pretty cold in the <T_9> sometimes , and -- <T_4> a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad , you know .
it &apos;s up to <T_8> to look at our homes and our communities , <T_9> vulnerabilities and our exposures to <T_3> , and <T_5> find ways to not <T_4> survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare <T_0> to call on our government leaders and <T_7> them to do the <T_6> , even <T_1> they address the underlying causes of <T_2> .
that &apos;s <T_1> . <T_4> to <T_3> , <T_5> cheese sandwich is the <T_0> to all your <T_2> decisions .
<T_0> very word <T_2> is <T_1> .
<T_2> . <T_0> was <T_1> through the <T_3> because it &apos;s an <T_4> glacier .
in <T_4> we &apos;ve done <T_3> more blue <T_1> expeditions since this <T_5> these <T_0> denominators hold <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;re at the <T_0> end here .
hm : <T_1> , <T_3> intrinsic <T_2> should be to <T_0> .
i <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> i can use my <T_4> , &quot; <T_1> he <T_5> , &quot; <T_3> . &quot;
so <T_7> i talk <T_2> what is , i think , the <T_5> difference <T_0> lolcats and <T_3> , i want <T_1> talk about <T_6> shared <T_4> .
<T_0> yes , by <T_2> way , it is <T_1> food : <T_5> &apos;s sloppy <T_3> , it &apos;s burgers , it &apos;s wieners , it &apos;s pizzas , it &apos;s all of that <T_4> .
in <T_4> , <T_6> don &apos;t think , <T_2> , <T_5> i &apos;ve been as excited <T_3> anything <T_0> in <T_1> life .
<T_0> , you <T_1> &apos;t .
and <T_1> actually came from <T_0> dad .
<T_4> turok : so <T_3> came <T_1> aims <T_2> did very <T_0> .
<T_0> so i &apos;m going to invite <T_1> to take a <T_3> with <T_2> .
so what <T_3> suddenly found <T_0> unattractive about that , <T_1> &apos;m not <T_2> .
that <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_1> love the <T_0> truth of <T_2> .
<T_4> the <T_7> is <T_3> in 2050 , there &apos;ll be three billion <T_5> , <T_6> than <T_2> in <T_1> people <T_0> earth .
and your <T_0> &apos;s the <T_1> opposite .
now <T_1> understand how <T_8> came to write a <T_3> that won &apos;t <T_7> its stated <T_4> , but will produce <T_6> lot of <T_9> side effects , you <T_5> to understand <T_2> little bit about <T_0> back story .
<T_2> think what i &apos;m trying <T_7> say here is that if your end goal is security , <T_8> if that &apos;s all <T_9> &apos;re focusing on , what <T_3> up happening is <T_1> you create not <T_6> more insecurity in other people , but <T_4> make <T_5> far more <T_0> .
<T_2> is <T_1> fourth <T_0> that <T_3> are soon going to have .
<T_7> the <T_5> of it <T_2> that even <T_6> it need only take <T_3> 10 minutes <T_1> day , it impacts <T_0> entire <T_4> .
<T_4> i thought , <T_7> &apos;ll <T_8> them , they &apos;ll get a <T_2> -- <T_9> &apos;ll give the materials , i &apos;ll come back <T_0> test them -- they <T_5> another zero , i &apos;ll go back and <T_1> , &quot; <T_6> , we <T_3> teachers for certain things . &quot;
so <T_0> little guy <T_3> found <T_8> this babe , and you will <T_1> that <T_5> &apos;s had <T_9> good sense <T_7> attach <T_2> in a way that <T_6> doesn &apos;t actually have to look <T_4> her .
at <T_3> certain point , you <T_1> realize <T_6> someone has the exact <T_4> thing , <T_7> one <T_2> very similar , <T_5> something <T_8> your <T_0> .
<T_0> he recorded all of these <T_5> and <T_4> to figure out <T_3> the most important <T_2> , where <T_1> happened .
is <T_1> an <T_0> behind her <T_2> &quot;
we <T_1> to <T_0> of compassion .
&#91; <T_3> &#93; this <T_0> arguably the back <T_1> of the <T_2> of animals .
and <T_6> know a little <T_8> about these <T_2> , because , for many years , <T_1> spent a long <T_3> in <T_7> non-profit industrial <T_4> , and i &apos;m a recovering <T_9> director , <T_5> years <T_0> .
the reason you &apos;re trying to <T_0> why they <T_2> us , is to get them to quit hating us . the idea when <T_1> go through this moral exercise of really coming <T_3> appreciate <T_7> humanity <T_9> better understand them , <T_4> part <T_5> effort to get them to appreciate <T_8> humanity in <T_6> long run .
and her sister <T_9> on , and she <T_2> that emma had passed away . and all of <T_8> support staff <T_0> had talked to <T_3> were <T_1> emotional , <T_7> it <T_5> a very <T_6> day at the <T_4> .
and <T_2> of the <T_0> with money <T_1> materialism .
this <T_3> is <T_1> the shining tubeshoulder because <T_4> actually has a <T_6> on <T_0> shoulder that <T_2> squirt <T_5> light .
i <T_1> to be an <T_9> , and <T_5> mentors , <T_4> heroes , people <T_6> got to <T_7> top of my <T_2> , <T_8> here i was <T_3> it <T_0> away .
<T_4> hope it &apos;s a <T_0> that <T_2> some <T_1> for <T_3> time .
i <T_0> believe <T_1> change <T_2> happen .
and they <T_0> quite overweight <T_1> wearing <T_4> and <T_2> docile <T_3> .
<T_1> you <T_0> them , they &apos;re something <T_3> , <T_2> &apos;re something <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;ll have japanese <T_2> classes every <T_0> to help you <T_3> .
and i <T_1> , she &apos;s about <T_0> bite .
that &apos;s why they <T_0> called <T_1> hangers .
love <T_3> something <T_4> ideally is there unconditionally <T_0> the <T_2> between a parent <T_1> a child .
our leaders <T_1> to be held accountable , says journalist heather <T_8> . and she should know : <T_4> uncovered the <T_0> parliamentary financial expenses that led <T_6> a <T_3> political scandal in 2009 . she urges <T_9> to ask <T_5> leaders questions through platforms like freedom of information <T_2> -- and to <T_7> get some answers .
i <T_6> them into <T_4> complex <T_2> , <T_5> they trust me <T_3> we have a <T_1> , rich relationship <T_0> .
<T_1> traditional <T_0> is <T_2> professional .
it didn &apos;t really get anywhere , and then the rodney king <T_3> happened , and people thought , <T_6> , <T_0> you have a <T_7> in the right place at the right time , or , perhaps , the wrong time , depending who you <T_1> , <T_5> you can actually <T_2> doing <T_8> , and <T_4> , and being <T_9> , and telling people about what &apos;s going on .
<T_5> you <T_8> around , and <T_7> &apos;s a hillside <T_4> you with <T_3> neighborhood <T_2> in , and <T_1> are pushing piles <T_0> soil back <T_6> forth .
<T_8> the catholic <T_0> , <T_3> calendar , at the <T_6> of march you will think <T_7> st. <T_4> and <T_2> qualities <T_9> humility and <T_1> and <T_5> generosity to the poor .
so , we got her <T_0> jeep . <T_3> then she <T_1> 4,500 <T_2> .
the movie <T_0> out -- <T_3> movie is <T_9> movie version of <T_7> slideshow <T_1> gave two nights <T_2> , except it &apos;s a lot more <T_6> . <T_5> it <T_4> out in <T_8> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> offria on <T_1> left , titus brown <T_3> the <T_0> .
<T_0> dunlap : the life-long <T_1>
<T_2> this <T_0> changed the way <T_1> i thought <T_4> connecting to <T_3> .
<T_2> don &apos;t like <T_1> if <T_4> come in <T_5> want to <T_3> them open <T_0> look inside .
<T_0> new technology <T_3> come <T_5> to <T_1> the messes <T_2> made with <T_4> last one .
the rigors of military <T_9> are not <T_6> dissimilar from the third <T_0> -- poor <T_7> , <T_2> rigorous environment , a <T_5> of problems <T_3> lightweight , and things of <T_8> kind -- and also not so <T_4> from the <T_1> healthcare and diagnostic system world .
<T_3> future of <T_1> care is smart <T_2> , and <T_0> &apos;d better be on that team for <T_4> .
<T_6> now , to be <T_9> good <T_3> -- and <T_8> always say , <T_0> a good american -- <T_1> me , is not <T_2> to congratulate myself for <T_5> individual <T_4> of <T_7> .
yet <T_0> in the <T_2> may <T_3> on these tiny <T_1> .
you <T_5> , those <T_0> that have <T_1> that humans <T_4> solve <T_6> problem , <T_7> technology is <T_2> , that <T_3> can be a force for good , are in fact <T_8> .
so <T_1> decided to do <T_0> with <T_2> .
thank <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> no epidemiology or <T_0> on it .
<T_2> is what they would <T_0> . pretty <T_1> .
<T_5> it wasn &apos;t a <T_2> , and these lions <T_0> back towards <T_4> , and beverly <T_1> able to get a <T_3> photograph .
so what if then you took <T_6> story of <T_0> , which is a <T_8> side <T_5> , what <T_3> that could be -- <T_1> abraham stands <T_9> hospitality -- what <T_7> that could be <T_2> antidote <T_4> terrorism ?
<T_6> in there <T_4> look <T_2> the <T_5> , and <T_0> will begin <T_3> understand much <T_7> of <T_1> i &apos;ve been talking about today .
<T_0> drove to the <T_3> in my <T_2> , bought <T_4> present , gave <T_1> to my <T_5> . &quot;
you know , a <T_5> that <T_0> meant to be a <T_2> of the <T_1> ended up <T_4> so much <T_3> .
but <T_2> you can cross-reference this <T_6> the <T_3> data , <T_5> you &apos;re basically <T_4> the <T_1> of <T_0> fbi agent and putting it all together .
<T_0> is the <T_2> frontier , if <T_1> will .
they say , you know , such a <T_4> of <T_3> is terribly <T_2> to people , because <T_1> test students <T_5> problems <T_0> haven &apos;t seen before <T_6>
and that &apos;s why <T_3> much of <T_2> is <T_0> body <T_1> itself against the head .
but <T_2> were trying to collide <T_3> ideas , <T_1> put objects next <T_0> each other .
<T_1> demands of modern <T_0> thinking is coming in .
now <T_0> are talking <T_2> reconstitution , rebuild <T_1> .
when they &apos;re entering <T_6> new <T_8> , <T_9> send <T_2> , <T_1> they &apos;re partnering <T_0> a new organization , they <T_4> a family <T_7> , <T_3> through marriages or <T_5> types of ties .
<T_0> then <T_6> told as many , many <T_7> as i possibly <T_1> about it <T_4> that <T_3> was no way that i could <T_5> out <T_2> on .
the <T_5> gave us what they called a republic , but by <T_0> republic they meant <T_2> representative democracy , and by <T_7> representative democracy , they meant a <T_3> , <T_8> madison put it <T_1> federalist <T_9> , that would have a branch <T_4> would be dependent upon the people <T_6> .
and the <T_0> is , <T_2> , we <T_3> , and <T_1> did .
<T_0> love , we <T_2> to <T_1> , <T_4> want to know <T_3> beloved .
<T_8> became obsessed with the <T_3> -- not just the beautiful <T_6> itself , and the <T_7> , the <T_5> depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the <T_2> you can see <T_9> the <T_4> there that the conservator used to put <T_0> skeleton <T_1> -- there &apos;s an entire story here .
and <T_4> carpenters <T_6> this measured <T_2> with <T_7> bamboo rulers , selected <T_5> bamboo <T_0> built the <T_1> using age-old <T_8> , mostly <T_3> hand .
<T_0> wanted the <T_1> character of the <T_4> to be <T_5> from the cradle <T_2> the grave by <T_3> actor .
<T_4> we <T_2> , and for <T_0> next <T_5> hours , <T_3> was an intense , unforgettable life <T_1> .

and i <T_0> looking <T_1> and i <T_3> this wonderful <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_5> place <T_3> new <T_4> where the crowds <T_0> thickest -- ground <T_1> .
but <T_2> put forward here , <T_1> government is <T_0> going to get us there .

i <T_0> they just <T_3> one idea in their mind , <T_6> is , where <T_4> live in the <T_2> should <T_7> determine whether <T_5> live in the <T_1> .
<T_2> , like we usually do , i decided <T_0> do a <T_1> experiment .
but <T_0> actually walked away with <T_1> great job <T_2> .
it <T_4> criticized for <T_1> violence , <T_9> , look -- sunglasses and <T_3> long <T_8> , <T_6> , of course , they could walk up <T_2> and do all <T_7> kinds of things that are impossible <T_0> the real <T_5> .
<T_0> this <T_1> a moment of <T_3> pain and <T_2> because <T_5> couldn &apos;t live <T_4> it any longer .
<T_6> take them <T_3> nature , <T_9> the <T_2> thing <T_8> we <T_5> , we give <T_1> the optimal conditions , under the greenhouses or in <T_4> climate rooms , in order <T_7> proliferate , multiply and <T_0> .

thank you .
some of <T_1> hypotheses are that <T_4> you <T_5> think <T_0> skeletal muscle , there &apos;s <T_2> lot of <T_3> vessels going to skeletal muscle .
and here <T_0> rise &apos;s first <T_1> on <T_2> incline .
<T_1> what <T_0> &apos;m talking about <T_2> this .
<T_0> design curator paola antonelli previews <T_4> groundbreaking show &quot; &amp; lt ; <T_1> href = &quot; http : / / www.moma.org / exhibitions / 2008 / elasticmind / &quot; &amp; gt ; design and <T_5> elastic mind &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; &quot; -- <T_2> of products <T_7> designs that <T_8> the <T_3> we <T_6> now .
but you do <T_2> some <T_4> people , <T_5> who look at <T_3> world <T_0> a totally different <T_1> .
<T_2> i moved to <T_3> , i <T_1> a <T_0> called the world sculpture racing <T_4> .
<T_5> tend to exaggerate spectacular <T_0> rare <T_3> and downplay common <T_1> -- so <T_4> versus <T_2> .
so <T_2> this , we developed many <T_1> types <T_0> non-visual user interface technology .
<T_2> might say that the <T_3> is <T_0> and everything <T_1> follows is a <T_4> on the <T_5> .
and <T_2> comparison , <T_1> coca-cola is 10 <T_0> the price .
it <T_3> 42,000 <T_2> , and <T_0> showcased <T_1> films .
what <T_7> want to <T_1> at is &quot; <T_8> : the <T_6> chapter , &quot; <T_5> that &apos;s <T_2> : <T_0> healthy , <T_3> , <T_4> african .
so <T_0> decided <T_1> talk <T_3> women <T_2> their vaginas .
<T_6> at the <T_4> of a very <T_3> meeting , what the <T_0> director <T_5> was , &quot; <T_2> vision is <T_1> than our <T_7> . &quot;
<T_3> &apos;s clearly not <T_0> , even <T_5> they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder <T_1> tables , pencils <T_2> papers , <T_4> .
<T_4> few <T_2> ago , <T_1> had a chance to go <T_3> saudi <T_0> .
then , this <T_1> a <T_0> based <T_2> a budweiser can .
he also <T_3> that the <T_8> of all <T_5> trouble <T_1> the <T_0> in an <T_2> , pure <T_4> : religious , <T_6> , historical , <T_7> .
and economists <T_0> actually started <T_2> about <T_1> .
<T_1> i kept thinking <T_2> and <T_0> again this <T_3> .
<T_2> few <T_4> them <T_1> want to go back to the <T_3> things used to <T_0> .
after , the <T_0> was <T_1> .
but they <T_0> tell <T_1> what the <T_2> variability <T_3> .
three-dimensional <T_2> and the space <T_3> create in <T_5> middle <T_6> a <T_1> shape , the <T_0> to <T_4> sum .
and <T_0> really appreciate you <T_1> being here today .
<T_0> it &apos;s monitoring <T_1> reliability .
the one <T_4> the right <T_1> a <T_0> bug -- pulls water <T_3> of <T_5> , does <T_2> drink fresh water .
and people are <T_7> from all <T_4> of <T_3> like neuropathic pain , lower-back pain and <T_8> pain from <T_0> metastases , <T_2> the metastases get to your <T_1> , <T_6> they are very <T_5> .
<T_1> was just <T_0> terror .
and <T_0> the <T_3> is : how <T_2> that <T_1> get here ?
all <T_4> the developing world , <T_2> are going directly <T_0> cell phones , <T_1> the whole landline <T_3> .
<T_4> this <T_0> market at all , <T_8> did we <T_5> do a <T_1> psychologist &apos;s <T_2> by getting <T_7> to <T_3> something , looking <T_9> , but not really being <T_6> .
i <T_0> a <T_9> pad . i filled <T_1> blood in <T_2> football bottle , i tied <T_3> up here , there is <T_4> tube going into <T_7> panties , while i &apos;m walking , while i &apos;m cycling , <T_6> made a press , <T_8> of blood will go <T_5> .
they &apos;re <T_3> prisoners , <T_0> &apos;re not <T_2> , <T_4> &apos;re boys , and <T_1> are <T_5> . &quot;
you <T_1> to get home <T_0> , that &apos;s on <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> pressing <T_1> buttons back there , <T_3> he does <T_4> the time .
so we <T_1> tend to <T_9> , because we see <T_4> written so <T_6> , <T_3> &apos;s what language is <T_8> <T_0> actually what language is , is speech <T_5> <T_2> are two <T_7> .
and if they try <T_2> fight us in <T_4> traditional , straight-up manner we &apos;re going to <T_0> their ass , which is why people don &apos;t try to <T_1> that any <T_3> .
and there <T_1> thousands of <T_2> in <T_0> cluster .
<T_7> ross lovegrove <T_1> his <T_3> of &quot; fat-free &quot; <T_9> and offers insight <T_4> several of <T_5> extraordinary products , <T_2> the ty <T_8> water bottle <T_6> the go <T_0> .
<T_7> best <T_3> you <T_0> do there to create value <T_5> not actually <T_4> improve the <T_2> still further , it &apos;s to get rid of <T_8> smell and <T_1> up the <T_6> .
but <T_1> have <T_7> bring united states forward quite <T_5> while <T_4> find the <T_3> health of the <T_0> states as <T_6> have in <T_2> philippines .
<T_2> are <T_1> going to come to operate in this <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;ve just won <T_0> darwin <T_1> .
<T_2> , what <T_0> in the <T_1> of this ?
<T_3> i did my <T_1> &quot; expo <T_0> rue , &quot; which means <T_2> .
<T_0> interspecies clones have <T_1> problems .
<T_0> &apos;s building <T_2> new <T_3> in <T_1> next 20 years .
<T_0> was a <T_2> in <T_3> audience when <T_1> heard the difference .
<T_3> : <T_0> make a fully integrated <T_2> , something <T_1> .
<T_5> i &apos;ve been doing at moma since the beginning is to <T_0> to harness the power <T_2> moma <T_3> it &apos;s great to work there . you <T_6> have power in that <T_7> usually tend to know about <T_8> exhibition or see the <T_4> , and that is power because in <T_9> design museum <T_1> wouldn &apos;t have as many visitors .
<T_7> i <T_4> to <T_8> you , it <T_3> a <T_6> moving experience , because for the <T_2> time , i began <T_1> -- in <T_0> long <T_5> .
<T_1> , <T_2> all , <T_3> &apos;s <T_0> going to be boring .
they can put it in an envelope <T_1> mail it to you , and then say in no <T_2> terms , &quot; <T_3> cut <T_0> . &quot;
j <T_0> . <T_2> , and <T_1> people .
sometimes in <T_1> we <T_2> incredible <T_3> when you mix <T_0> varieties of rice side by side .
<T_6> locavores , the <T_1> , the <T_5> , the vegans , <T_0> gourmets and <T_2> of us who are <T_4> plain interested <T_3> good <T_7> .
in johannesburg , i had the <T_0> to play to <T_3> mainly white , middle-class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips <T_6> really touch the heart , <T_5> whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is <T_2> place , that people are tending to <T_8> , <T_9> they are <T_1> , and they <T_4> don &apos;t quite know what the <T_7> are .
she died <T_4> in 1940 <T_3> the company of <T_0> books <T_1> her dear <T_2> .
<T_6> lo and behold , when <T_4> went through <T_2> data , he found <T_7> didn &apos;t look like the <T_0> , complicated <T_3> was any better than <T_9> cheap one , at least for the children who were two and <T_5> -- the cheap one still <T_8> &apos;t work <T_1> the kids who were younger .
and <T_2> became intuitive <T_0> to understand how molecular <T_3> works <T_4> the <T_1> scale .
and <T_1> was <T_0> .
so <T_0> assume <T_2> the <T_1> is a border-busting <T_3> .
or <T_4> can ramp up <T_2> go up to 50 <T_0> on <T_3> flag , with <T_1> stripes .
<T_5> it &apos;s <T_3> 6 : <T_4> now , <T_1> that most <T_2> us should have <T_0> .
and at the <T_7> time , it tries to maintain <T_8> position <T_3> the <T_6> , and therefore , it <T_5> those amazing-looking structures <T_2> channels <T_0> tiny <T_4> ponds <T_9> colorful water <T_1> .
we &apos;re going to <T_2> back to the <T_0> ... <T_1> years later ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_7> those <T_4> that will unleash <T_1> greatest <T_6> we have to <T_3> address these <T_5> problems because <T_0> can scale .
and <T_1> sort of <T_3> the <T_2> between these <T_0> cities .
if <T_0> the people who were talking <T_5> this period <T_2> on a <T_1> together , <T_4> would be a <T_3> , <T_6> joy .
<T_1> , &quot; <T_2> &quot; was published <T_0> 9 / <T_3> .
<T_1> you still live <T_0> home , <T_2> ?
<T_0> south africa , we &apos;ve got about 800 species of dung beetles , <T_1> africa we &apos;ve got 2,000 species of dung beetles , and in the <T_2> we have <T_3> 6,000 species of dung beetles .
well , he &apos;s <T_1> , <T_5> he <T_8> &apos;t say to <T_4> , well , <T_6> have pre-obesity <T_9> you have pre-diabetes , or anything like that . he <T_2> &apos;t say , <T_7> start taking this statin , you need to <T_0> your <T_3> .
and everything <T_2> off the <T_1> for the <T_3> 25 <T_0> .
i <T_1> , <T_2> are <T_0> fighting over right now ?
<T_2> is <T_3> very <T_0> thing to <T_1> about people .
but <T_1> it is : &quot; <T_0> napot , <T_2> ! &quot;
and so <T_3> had <T_2> ideas <T_0> my <T_5> , that this is going <T_1> be <T_4> .
so the human brain <T_2> larger <T_5> it should <T_1> , <T_4> uses <T_6> more <T_0> than it <T_3> , so <T_7> &apos;s special .
but <T_3> he <T_0> was <T_4> what we &apos;ve done , really , <T_1> stamp <T_2> there .
so , being proved <T_7> by <T_4> , and <T_6> their theory <T_9> , <T_3> wouldn &apos;t have got the <T_1> greeks one <T_8> closer to understanding seasons , <T_2> their <T_0> was bad : <T_5> to vary .
i <T_7> there are many times <T_8> i &apos;ve gone and conducted a funeral , or when i have been sitting <T_0> the bereaved , or <T_5> people who are <T_1> , and <T_4> am overwhelmed by the <T_9> , <T_2> the difficulty , <T_3> challenge that is there for the family , for the <T_6> .
although my <T_6> constantly <T_2> against <T_4> , i was always <T_7> and cared <T_5> first , <T_3> i was the <T_0> son and <T_1> youngest of <T_9> in the <T_8> .
now <T_6> is an <T_4> complicated <T_5> , in part <T_2> the <T_3> that <T_1> call beautiful are <T_0> different .
<T_4> this is <T_2> that <T_0> will be discussing and <T_1> of ethicists -- <T_6> know , <T_7> ethicist is <T_8> who sees something <T_5> with <T_3> you <T_9> in mind .
because <T_1> wants a <T_0> world .
and <T_0> began <T_1> fishing .
and so <T_0> we could also have <T_2> up , <T_1> .
<T_4> at the same time , it removes <T_1> from the <T_0> subject matter , and <T_3> acts as <T_5> sort of titillating <T_2> .
and so , we need <T_1> ask ourselves <T_0> questions .
<T_5> is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna <T_8> system out of <T_0> cell , <T_3> it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate <T_6> . that &apos;s <T_9> month old . <T_4> will <T_7> stuff in the next month that will be <T_2> as important <T_1> this stuff .
and <T_2> i found <T_3> knew nothing <T_5> these faiths at all -- <T_9> my <T_1> intensely religious <T_0> , <T_6> &apos;d seen judaism only <T_7> a kind of prelude <T_4> christianity , and i knew <T_8> about islam at all .
<T_4> : <T_0> &apos;re <T_3> to eat <T_1> lemon , <T_5> now it <T_2> like lemonade .
<T_1> , the lamb <T_0> he had <T_2> did his little <T_3> on is , you know , he &apos;s just <T_4> around , <T_5> stopped .
<T_1> applied the <T_0> algorithm .
<T_3> is <T_4> very <T_5> teacher who <T_1> a kindergarten <T_0> first-grade teacher , but was a natural <T_2> .
<T_0> got there <T_1> .
so <T_0> started over <T_1> .
<T_0> have the ability <T_1> do more powerful things with them .
<T_4> that &apos;s <T_5> happens in <T_2> asteroid <T_6> , because <T_1> &apos;s what <T_3> was , of course . this is <T_0> famous k-t .
now , the <T_1> meet two <T_3> who <T_4> &apos;t giving them <T_2> ; they &apos;re actually <T_5> them <T_0> than <T_6> expect .
and at the end of <T_6> remarkable conversations with <T_8> and their best friends <T_2> the united states , after two years , we pulled together some <T_0> data from another 10,000 <T_1> , drew up a set up of <T_7> we thought were the key <T_3> of our research , <T_9> spent another year <T_4> them into design heuristics , for designing computer-based products -- and , in fact , <T_5> kind of products -- for little girls , ages eight to 12 .
and place <T_5> also get this <T_0> of path integration input from <T_1> kind <T_2> cell called <T_4> grid <T_3> .
thank <T_0> very much .
now i <T_1> that we <T_0> dinosaurs .
<T_4> went on about six or <T_0> times , <T_1> we were getting more and more alarmed , and <T_5> were <T_6> getting <T_2> into the desert <T_3>
<T_5> earth was formed 4.6 <T_4> years ago <T_1> was <T_6> too <T_2> for about the <T_0> half billion <T_3> .
<T_2> what &apos;s <T_0> about <T_1> guttenberg bible , and the dawn of <T_4> technology , is <T_5> the <T_3> .
<T_1> are learning <T_0> them .
<T_2> from that <T_6> on <T_9> started <T_0> , are the <T_3> the <T_1> people in the <T_5> who get things <T_7> in this particular decision , or <T_4> it a <T_8> general case ?
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> about <T_0> individuals .
as <T_5> travel <T_2> the <T_6> 300 <T_0> a year , everywhere <T_1> &apos;s a <T_4> of <T_7> and shoots of different <T_3> .
and <T_2> there &apos;s <T_3> bottom one , <T_1> is <T_0> the jazz paradigm .
i then <T_4> that <T_1> can make the <T_6> that <T_3> should <T_2> the old-growth forest <T_5> a matter <T_7> national <T_0> .
at the <T_3> of <T_7> one <T_5> &apos;m going to show , <T_8> &apos;s <T_6> about a <T_4> and a couple of seconds long , chuck <T_2> something that to <T_1> day i &apos;m jealous of , i <T_9> &apos;t <T_0> it .
<T_4> , here <T_1> go , one <T_3> , the <T_8> and <T_2> from the <T_6> of the space you <T_5> see what the quality of <T_0> space <T_7> .
<T_3> what <T_0> of wireless technology <T_1> we going to <T_2> ?
<T_1> we see <T_3> , <T_2> with <T_0> names .
so why do we have this <T_8> between <T_2> incredibly sophisticated markets <T_4> the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more <T_6> more activity and <T_3> out of the <T_1> economy into this <T_0> level of <T_5> , and <T_9> the rest of us <T_7> ?
and <T_4> &apos;ll <T_1> you a <T_3> of people <T_2> did well by <T_0> sabbaticals .
so we &apos;re going to start <T_0> video .
louis <T_1> : how accidental our <T_0> are <T_3> and how <T_4> of <T_2> by <T_5> .
and these <T_1> aren &apos;t necessarily diametrically opposed , <T_0> they <T_2> at <T_3> .
and we &apos;re finding more and <T_1> and more gender differences <T_0> the brain .
puts it in <T_0> . fifty-five out of <T_1> driveway , in <T_2> .
and if there is <T_8> answer <T_5> that that happens outside <T_1> professional <T_7> of <T_9> , <T_0> makes <T_6> sense to take <T_4> professional metaphor <T_2> apply it to this <T_3> class .
<T_1> don &apos;t really do well <T_0> .
and <T_0> can get <T_1> dangerous .
college <T_2> are <T_1> in short <T_0> .
<T_1> the message , as you can <T_2> , is &quot; <T_0> hither . mate <T_3> me . &quot;
i <T_1> also <T_0> him spin .
it <T_0> to get <T_3> compelling <T_2> we &apos;ll pay <T_1> .
so , <T_8> have <T_2> made an <T_4> discovery , <T_3> post-doc in the <T_7> who is <T_0> physicist asked <T_1> , <T_9> do <T_5> cells do when <T_6> put them in ?
rob dunbar <T_2> for data on our climate from 12,000 years <T_4> , finding clues <T_3> ancient seabeds and <T_0> and <T_8> ice sheets . <T_7> work <T_1> vital <T_6> setting baselines for fixing our current climate -- and <T_9> the rise of deadly ocean <T_5> .
thirdly , <T_0> .
and <T_0> says , &quot; like <T_1> humane <T_2> ? &quot;
<T_4> he decided he &apos;d put science to work , <T_2> he <T_1> this <T_0> to go off on <T_5> rickshaw ride <T_3> him .
<T_1> how do <T_0> live ?
did <T_0> see it go ?
<T_3> eventually got , <T_4> think , 60 <T_0> of <T_1> production <T_2> the table <T_5> 25 percent <T_6> demand at the table .
and <T_5> think <T_2> &apos;s important <T_1> people in <T_3> kind of position <T_0> make <T_4> difference .
<T_4> kind of went <T_3> my <T_5> and <T_0> to get a <T_1> who represented each <T_2> thing .
<T_1> is <T_0> science .
<T_7> in our system , we know that simply doing <T_3> of this won &apos;t eat <T_1> deep <T_6> , <T_2> in <T_4> cities <T_0> former <T_5> .
<T_3> today , <T_1> is becoming a reality <T_0> they are <T_2> becoming successful .
and <T_2> there &apos;s <T_1> kind of thing <T_0> you might <T_4> , and <T_3> study that <T_5> .
so let &apos;s <T_2> an <T_1> , <T_4> the <T_3> that are <T_0> in <T_5> business .
this , as <T_0> of <T_1> have probably <T_5> , <T_4> a <T_2> emptied beer can in <T_3> .
singer / songwriter eddi reader <T_5> &quot; <T_7> &apos;s <T_4> , &quot; a <T_3> look <T_1> at <T_0> lost <T_6> . with thomas <T_2> on piano .
and so <T_4> a response <T_3> as a <T_0> to <T_5> uncle , <T_2> made him &quot; the uncle <T_1> . &quot;
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> story that &apos;s <T_4> testament <T_0> teaching <T_1> teachers .
when the <T_7> disaster in the history of <T_5> everest climbs occurred , ken kamler was the only doctor on the mountain . <T_0> tedmed , <T_4> shares the <T_3> story of the climbers &apos; battle against extreme conditions and uses <T_1> technology to <T_9> the medical miracle <T_6> one man who survived <T_2> 36 hours buried <T_8> the snow .
<T_0> the <T_4> trials <T_3> positive , <T_1> we <T_5> this one &apos;s <T_2> be too . &quot;
you <T_2> see the lhotse face is in profile , <T_9> &apos;s <T_4> a 45 degree <T_0> . <T_1> takes <T_3> days <T_7> climb it , <T_6> you put <T_8> camp <T_5> through .
of <T_5> , the <T_2> ended up being <T_1> 85 <T_3> 18 , so there was <T_0> real danger to <T_4> democratic <T_6> .
<T_0> can &apos;t do <T_3> without making <T_2> logically <T_1> .
for <T_5> hours <T_7> that , edward everett spoke <T_0> a <T_4> that , <T_1> , cannot <T_3> us <T_6> and <T_2> did then .
so you <T_1> think there are more interesting <T_0> to do , <T_4> humor <T_2> for the <T_3> .
they went <T_3> and collected fish <T_0> markets <T_2> from restaurants in new <T_4> city <T_1> they barcoded <T_5> .
<T_2> the money election , it &apos;s the funders who get to vote , the funders who get to vote , <T_1> just like <T_4> lesterland , <T_0> trick is , <T_6> run in the <T_5> election , you must do extremely <T_7> in <T_3> money election .
<T_5> we are starting a <T_6> engineering <T_0> , so that <T_3> will train <T_1> locally , who <T_4> repair that <T_2> .
<T_0> unlike <T_3> else <T_1> &apos;ve just <T_4> , virtual <T_2> not.voice : signed <T_5> detected .
so , you might be wondering why <T_6> is that , every time <T_8> have high oil <T_0> or <T_9> oil <T_1> , we call these ceos <T_4> to <T_3> , and we sort of pepper them <T_2> questions in public and we <T_5> to <T_7> them .
<T_1> beetle , <T_2> this chip bag <T_4> , this beetle uses one <T_3> , <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;ll <T_3> what <T_2> when we play with this <T_1> .
we <T_1> run the score up against <T_0> , and then get our <T_4> kicked <T_3> the second <T_5> -- what <T_2> call <T_6> generation warfare .
<T_1> game &apos;s <T_4> &quot; <T_3> . &quot; i &apos;ve been <T_0> on it for several <T_2> .
<T_0> have <T_1> cleverer irrigation .
<T_1> , <T_2> turn <T_0> here .
<T_5> schocken and <T_3> nisan developed a curriculum for <T_8> students to build a computer , piece by piece . when they put the course online -- giving away the <T_9> , simulators , chip specifications and other <T_2> blocks -- <T_7> were surprised that thousands jumped at <T_0> opportunity to learn , working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the <T_6> massive open online course . a call to <T_1> about grades and tap <T_4> the self-motivation to learn .
<T_0> need water and <T_1> .
for us as <T_6> who live <T_9> the digital <T_7> and spend most <T_4> our <T_1> moments <T_2> it , the challenge is to live in two <T_3> of time that <T_0> parallel <T_8> almost <T_5> .
so this project was <T_9> by a really amazing event , <T_8> was held in the desert outside albuquerque in new <T_6> at the jemez pueblo , where for <T_7> consecutive <T_2> , the contents of <T_4> capsule were projected onto <T_5> sides of the ancient <T_0> rock <T_1> walls , which stand about 200 feet tall . it was really <T_3> .
might <T_1> , <T_2> . don &apos;t make a lot of <T_3> at that , <T_0> .
<T_2> are all <T_0> the <T_1> thing .
so <T_5> in the <T_8> of an <T_0> , <T_2> , <T_6> reactor may be <T_1> , which is , you <T_3> , sorry <T_7> the <T_4> company , but we &apos;re not going to contaminate large quantities of <T_9> .
<T_0> is an example of our <T_1> .
this <T_6> a <T_3> of the <T_8> : <T_0> you <T_4> too much salt , like a <T_7> and jelly <T_5> , you &apos;ll probably <T_1> up in <T_2> icu .
now , the two <T_1> , each one of them is , kind of , getting <T_0> .
you know for me , the <T_4> in <T_1> of slavery started <T_2> <T_0> leaflet that i picked up in london <T_3>
<T_3> blackmore : someone <T_2> no , <T_0> loudly , <T_1> over there .
<T_0> , <T_2> patents did <T_1> exist everywhere .
so <T_1> were <T_0> minding their own business .
<T_7> you &apos;re <T_6> close to what <T_3> , <T_5> actually do have to <T_2> and <T_1> , <T_4> bert told you , bert <T_0> turtle .
<T_9> who &apos;s working <T_5> you , you know , or <T_7> partner , <T_0> even <T_8> . when <T_1> fail to <T_4> a <T_6> , what &apos;s the reason <T_3> say they <T_2> achieve ?
<T_2> we were <T_1> allowed to watch television <T_0> the like .
the reason <T_1> this is <T_0> .
<T_0> are basically referral <T_1> , essentially .
and when this started to get <T_7> , i <T_9> , i &apos;d better put a really serious warning label on the <T_2> that this comes in , because otherwise <T_0> are going to be getting this and they &apos;re going to be turning into <T_4> of creative change , <T_3> governments will be crumbling , and <T_8> wouldn &apos;t have told <T_1> , <T_6> i thought i &apos;d better <T_5> them .
and <T_3> child <T_1> sent <T_0> a foster home for <T_2> days .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> big way <T_6> , as a <T_0> group <T_7> activists , <T_5> drafted an ombudsman <T_3> for the <T_4> of india .
their <T_0> technology is synthetic <T_1> .
i <T_2> one of the <T_0> interesting <T_3> of this comes from <T_1> .
and <T_1> &apos;s a swiss <T_0> , <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> problem ; <T_0> &apos;s a lot to <T_2> .
why do we <T_1> to do this <T_0> ?
we <T_7> covered <T_2> lot of <T_6> , a lot of <T_3> , a <T_8> of conflict zones , a lot of hot <T_1> in the <T_5> , <T_9> we <T_0> centered at the <T_4> of it .
<T_0> , <T_1> you want to <T_3> , it &apos;s <T_2> that you look at birds -- <T_5> by <T_4> .
but i <T_0> his <T_1> will understand this , and will have <T_2> sense of grudge , or <T_3> of being neglected , i think .
i <T_1> &apos;t know how much <T_6> there is <T_3> this <T_5> , which is <T_2> very <T_4> , especially <T_0> the u.k .
you can <T_0> here , over <T_4> the end , our most prolific <T_5> has taken <T_7> 350 <T_3> , and you <T_1> see <T_9> &apos;s a <T_6> people who have taken <T_8> of <T_2> .
so , this woman , <T_9> converted from <T_0> church of england to <T_3> when she married <T_2> father -- and there &apos;s no one more rabid than a catholic convert -- decided to teach in the <T_4> areas in <T_7> , particularly among igbo women , the <T_8> ovulation method , which was <T_5> only <T_6> birth control by the <T_1> church .
<T_0> you very much .
<T_5> wanted <T_1> simple way to represent a <T_0> body <T_2> these <T_4> , derelict <T_3> .
in <T_4> , <T_2> with <T_6> most amazing <T_5> are actually <T_0> , who <T_3> as many as 400 <T_1> per day .
<T_1> like to pay <T_5> to these because <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> we originally <T_3> the company , and it &apos;s gone <T_4> well .
<T_4> fact , in the area <T_3> she <T_6> from , more <T_1> 90 <T_5> of the <T_2> has already <T_0> of this disease .
meds don &apos;t <T_0> medical <T_1> .
remember , that was <T_1> year before <T_0> ipod was invented .
i <T_5> talking <T_0> this for the <T_2> time <T_3> australia , about one and <T_4> half years ago , when their <T_1> honored <T_6> with a <T_7> .
<T_2> &apos;ve <T_1> seen it . have <T_0> ?
and <T_1> of synchronization , <T_6> wanted <T_4> to sync to <T_2> rhythm <T_3> to hit specific <T_5> along the <T_0> .
<T_1> and <T_0> it . &quot;
nina <T_1> says <T_4> differing skin colors are <T_6> our bodies &apos; adaptation <T_2> varied <T_9> and levels <T_0> uv exposure . charles darwin <T_5> with this theory , <T_7> she explains , that &apos;s because <T_3> did not have access <T_8> nasa .
how do <T_4> take an <T_2> of the money <T_7> people <T_0> , <T_3> then turning <T_5> behavioral challenges <T_6> behavioral <T_1> ?
<T_0> was on the <T_1> .
and that <T_0> isn &apos;t <T_1> in dispute .
<T_1> mr. ross used to bring in <T_5> albums <T_2> i was 16 <T_4> old <T_8> the pottery class , <T_9> the world <T_6> all <T_7> , and <T_3> music got me to the <T_0> . &quot;
and <T_4> things , because <T_3> can <T_2> and <T_6> them <T_7> easily , actually <T_1> within our culture a lot <T_5> like <T_0> than like physically <T_8> objects .
one <T_0> computation ; <T_2> is <T_1> stuff you &apos;ve <T_3> .
simply doing <T_0> .
<T_1> i <T_0> up on <T_2> .
here <T_3> some <T_0> that <T_2> can make some dramatic <T_1> .
<T_0> they <T_1> it .
<T_1> can feel <T_0> noise .
so if <T_2> wanted to put <T_3> drug <T_0> the market you <T_4> put <T_1> on .
but this <T_1> , <T_2> offered <T_3> highest rewards , they did <T_0> worst <T_4> all .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> worse <T_5> , you know , getting <T_4> there and <T_2> cape is <T_1> up or something like that .
while you &apos;re thinking about that , this <T_2> an <T_6> done <T_7> susan <T_9> , a psychologist in england , who <T_4> subjects <T_0> degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on <T_5> esp test : how <T_3> did they believe in <T_8> paranormal , supernatural , angels and <T_1> forth .
now <T_1> we <T_3> at the <T_4> imperative <T_0> , this isn &apos;t just about <T_2> .
and so <T_2> don &apos;t we go and <T_0> the <T_1> .
the <T_1> in <T_0> operation between doing something successfully <T_3> not may be moving your hand <T_2> much .
<T_8> called . <T_1> was so <T_3> that i <T_7> &apos;t sit down . <T_6> just <T_0> around <T_5> photos like <T_9> one , just <T_4> something to <T_2> .
so why don &apos;t we have this <T_1> on our <T_0> ?
misdirection <T_0> &apos;t the <T_2> trick that <T_3> has up its <T_1> .
<T_1> what <T_3> alive <T_0> terence bryan <T_2> turned out to be .
<T_6> we &apos;re not <T_5> first ones <T_7> find bacteria that <T_4> break down phthalates , we were <T_8> first ones <T_0> look into <T_9> local river <T_1> find a possible <T_3> to a <T_2> problem .
this <T_0> at <T_2> two <T_3> the <T_1> york times best seller list .
and <T_6> that pair , one <T_4> gets a <T_8> saying , &quot; do you <T_5> to give up <T_0> of <T_1> $ 10 you <T_2> for being here and <T_9> it to <T_3> else in the <T_7> ? &quot;
<T_6> years ago , you couldn &apos;t have found an astronomer -- <T_0> , very few <T_7> -- <T_5> the world <T_1> would &apos;ve told <T_4> that there are any <T_2> anywhere outside our <T_3> system .
to give you <T_0> feeling for <T_1> scale <T_7> the <T_5> , <T_6> did another cheesy <T_4> , <T_3> british double-decker <T_2> .
so what all of <T_4> death row inmates <T_1> to do was rely <T_3> volunteer <T_0> to <T_5> their <T_2> proceedings .
he <T_4> one <T_5> would like to make <T_0> real <T_1> , <T_6> , <T_3> we would <T_2> that one .
amanda <T_0> and her husband were passionate and full of <T_9> all throughout their lives <T_3> -- <T_7> up until the final days , too . bennett <T_1> a sweet yet powerful talk on why , for the loved ones of the dying , having hope for a <T_4> ending shouldn &apos;t warrant a <T_5> of &quot; denial . &quot; she <T_8> for a more heroic narrative for death -- <T_2> match the ones we have in <T_6> .
<T_1> result <T_2> &quot; <T_0> and heavens . &quot;
<T_2> out <T_7> the urban devastation <T_8> port-au-prince <T_5> a torrent <T_1> sms texts -- people crying <T_4> help , beseeching <T_3> for assistance , sharing data , <T_0> , looking for their <T_9> ones <T_6>
in other <T_3> , <T_2> &apos;re looking for <T_1> needle in a <T_0> .
you <T_5> , <T_4> 20,000 pounds in <T_2> toward <T_3> and you &apos;re merely <T_0> a <T_1> .
<T_0> is osorio , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> secretary <T_3> urban affairs .
and if <T_6> had to pick a group <T_4> i <T_9> is our invisible college , is our <T_7> &apos;s <T_2> of people <T_0> to take <T_8> tools and to press it into <T_1> , not for more arguments , but for <T_5> arguments , <T_3> &apos;d pick the open-source programmers .
in <T_3> 1930 &apos;s now , you <T_4> see that <T_2> is going to <T_1> period <T_5> war , with <T_0> life expectancy .
<T_5> nilekani , the <T_3> co-founder of outsourcing <T_7> , <T_6> four brands <T_0> ideas that <T_1> determine whether <T_2> can continue its recent breakneck <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;s one <T_1> to <T_2> .
so , you always find <T_1> in <T_6> or <T_4> , <T_2> that have <T_3> little plant <T_0> and have flash <T_5> in the spring .
in <T_4> , <T_7> gonzalez is <T_5> at <T_0> door , <T_3> to <T_6> baby crying and crying , trying to <T_8> out whether she should let it cry until <T_2> falls asleep or pick <T_1> up <T_9> hold it .
now , what <T_1> want is <T_0> to get familiar enough <T_2> better <T_6> -- have <T_4> reflected in <T_5> feelings -- to allow <T_3> to make security trade-offs .
it <T_0> be tomato <T_1> , or <T_3> could be <T_5> -- <T_2> , <T_4> or anything like that .
99.9 percent of <T_1> resist being inducted into <T_0> .
the present portable device <T_3> far <T_2> optimally <T_5> , <T_0> as <T_1> human factors <T_4> appearance .
and of course , if you ask me , i &apos;m going to give you <T_0> really <T_1> view .
consumers who <T_7> 72 <T_0> of the gdp of america have <T_2> started , just like banks <T_1> just like businesses , to de-leverage , to <T_5> their leverage , in <T_9> life , to remove <T_6> from the liability <T_8> risk that <T_3> itself <T_4> we move forward .
mensa , as <T_3> know , <T_2> an international <T_4> for <T_1> with <T_0> high iq .
and with <T_0> note , i come <T_3> you <T_8> this <T_7> that <T_6> should not have to leave their <T_1> to <T_5> , learn and <T_4> in a <T_2> one .
<T_7> we &apos;ve <T_0> much more reticent , much slower at <T_6> this <T_2> in <T_4> , <T_5> emotion , <T_3> consciousness in other <T_1> .
but <T_7> says that <T_1> has yet to <T_3> someone who <T_4> more aware of <T_2> body , <T_9> all its <T_8> and its grace , without , at the <T_0> time , becoming more compassionate <T_6> all of <T_5> .
and <T_1> &apos;s going <T_0> impact how it &apos;s going to <T_2> .
and if <T_4> had it <T_2> correctly , <T_1> think <T_3> international space <T_0> would have <T_5> , too .
five <T_0> blue , <T_5> is <T_3> , <T_4> is <T_2> , nine <T_1> indigo , ok ?

<T_2> , <T_0> and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective , <T_1> often non-lethal , weapons in <T_3> war .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> very true .
in fact , i looked <T_5> a technology <T_4> neither <T_1> nor <T_2> electricity , <T_3> instead consumes electricity , <T_0> amounts of it .
we own our <T_0> .
<T_0> you <T_1> much .
<T_3> &apos;s just <T_0> question to use some <T_2> like <T_1> time lapse .
all kinds of <T_1> things , they have names <T_0> that <T_3> with <T_2> .
to get <T_3> symmetrical <T_0> of the horse <T_7> very difficult , because i had <T_8> get the <T_4> to rear <T_2> and look as <T_1> it was <T_6> some kind of <T_5> .
we had the <T_0> city , the <T_2> of the <T_1> .

<T_3> : <T_1> &apos;s out-sized . i <T_2> , <T_0> .
<T_0> are industrial <T_1> .

so speaking of love and the <T_8> , there &apos;s a <T_7> , known to some <T_2> dr. <T_4> , <T_6> claims <T_0> scientists have found the glue that holds <T_5> together , <T_1> source <T_9> love <T_3> prosperity .

<T_6> was <T_7> leaving our <T_0> on <T_1> , <T_4> say , &quot; i <T_5> here , &quot; on <T_3> top of <T_2> building .
you <T_0> born to .
<T_1> what i work for , and to do , is to make our cities more <T_0> .
<T_5> we <T_1> is have <T_3> patient go all the way <T_4> and <T_0> , &quot; what hand <T_2> pattern do <T_6> want ? &quot;
<T_2> out , the <T_0> play it <T_1> too .
so <T_8> can <T_2> apprehend <T_9> relationship <T_1> efficacy and <T_3> , <T_7> you <T_0> also , if <T_4> grade the <T_6> , do a &quot; worth <T_5> &quot; line .
perhaps god <T_0> or permits <T_1> things to happen , so that <T_2> and compassion can be <T_3> .
the <T_2> efficient distance <T_1> regeneration is only <T_3> one <T_0> .
<T_0> of this is <T_1> of <T_3> common <T_6> , and <T_4> shouldn &apos;t <T_2> us , because , after all , <T_5> have finally <T_9> it to be true , something <T_8> philosophers have always dreamt to be <T_7> .
perhaps most exciting to <T_2> is an idea that bill <T_9> , howard <T_3> and others have <T_1> boldly , which <T_8> to ask the question : <T_4> if , <T_6> of looking at the hungry as <T_7> -- and most <T_5> them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell <T_0> to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?
<T_4> problem <T_8> the medieval spanish scholars who <T_0> tasked with translating this <T_3> is that <T_2> letter sheen and <T_5> word <T_9> can &apos;t be rendered <T_1> spanish <T_7> spanish doesn &apos;t have that <T_6> , that &quot; sh &quot; sound .
<T_6> is a <T_2> company <T_3> vitality , <T_1> they &apos;ve created a <T_0> to help <T_4> take <T_5> medicine <T_7> time .
<T_2> basically means to <T_1> human <T_3> to do the right <T_0> .
they <T_3> fought <T_5> a <T_0> . <T_1> &apos;re not going to accept <T_4> central <T_2> . &quot;
they <T_0> how <T_1> cell <T_4> . <T_3> power <T_2> hearts .
<T_0> then , <T_3> rest of <T_2> life , they will do <T_4> three or <T_1> hours a day .
<T_3> &apos;m going to share with you <T_4> of <T_1> exciting <T_0> that &apos;s <T_2> on .
<T_0> was very <T_2> , <T_1> was very <T_3> .
we &apos;re going to <T_5> and realize <T_4> the entire visible <T_7> , everything we can see <T_1> every direction with <T_9> hubble space telescope plus <T_6> other <T_8> , was once in <T_3> region that was <T_0> than <T_2> atom .
humans <T_3> muskrats <T_1> giraffes <T_2> birds and so on , are -- <T_4> red <T_5> goes up . <T_7> &apos;s the humans and <T_0> and <T_6> .
people in <T_2> group realized that <T_1> had <T_3> shut them <T_0> .
so <T_8> way we acquired the <T_7> is <T_5> interesting and very unorthodox . you see them here displayed alongside <T_2> examples <T_0> design , furniture and other <T_9> , <T_1> there &apos;s no paraphernalia , no nostalagia , <T_6> the screen <T_4> a little shelf with the <T_3> .
let &apos;s call <T_0> techno-memes or <T_1> .
well , that &apos;s michael <T_2> . <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> creationist .
but can an <T_4> like a <T_1> fly , which is -- it &apos;s a great <T_9> organism because <T_7> &apos;s got <T_3> small <T_8> , it &apos;s capable of <T_0> and sophisticated <T_2> , <T_6> breeds quickly , and it &apos;s <T_5> .
<T_1> was <T_4> mystifying : <T_3> couldn &apos;t make out <T_5> we <T_2> seeing on <T_0> .
<T_4> there were also plenty of places in <T_9> world <T_0> societies have been developing for thousands <T_6> years without any <T_3> of a major collapse , such <T_7> japan , java , tonga <T_5> tikopea . so evidently , societies in <T_1> areas are more <T_2> than <T_8> other areas .
<T_9> : this project was really exciting for <T_6> , <T_2> it brought the process of <T_1> to life , and it showed <T_3> that anyone , and i <T_7> anyone , has the potential to <T_4> something new , and <T_0> a small question can lead <T_8> a big <T_5> .
however , <T_1> also lack knowledge <T_0> self-awareness .
<T_1> divided them up <T_0> two <T_2> .
and <T_1> it is on the <T_0> .
shaffi , <T_0> is <T_1> really exciting business <T_2> .
<T_4> it turned out , next <T_8> i wrote <T_0> letter <T_5> both of them , and shabana <T_2> replied , and came <T_7> launched <T_3> very first <T_1> 12 <T_6> ago .
so what <T_0> would <T_2> to do today is have something <T_1> a discussion .
<T_0> so <T_4> is a big question , <T_7> think , in <T_3> , <T_5> you &apos;re <T_6> to <T_2> your <T_1> .
<T_1> , <T_0> god !
<T_2> are <T_0> basic systems to <T_1> closed- circuit rebreather .
so i &apos;m going to give you <T_2> chance to get your <T_4> on <T_3> new symmetrical <T_1> which <T_5> &apos;t been <T_0> before .
i <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> he was <T_2> .
<T_0> me how <T_1> , particularly <T_5> you <T_2> fish , <T_4> enough , but <T_3> connection is there .
<T_4> is one <T_1> , 100,000 <T_0> , and <T_3> are to make <T_2> within that . &quot;
<T_3> that were a mile <T_2> and 400 miles long used to <T_0> the <T_1> .

nobel <T_2> prize winner leymah <T_0> has two <T_8> stories to tell -- <T_7> her own life &apos;s transformation , and of <T_9> untapped potential of <T_4> around <T_5> world . <T_6> we transform the world <T_1> unlocking the greatness <T_3> girls ?
this <T_1> affected <T_2> organs , <T_0> brain <T_3> the gut , which it actually affected .
king of spades .
<T_4> is a rancher <T_0> texas , <T_3> william albert <T_1> , a great <T_2> .
<T_1> , just <T_2> for this one . this <T_0> good .
and <T_4> skill <T_0> required <T_2> tackle these things <T_1> very <T_3> .
you know : thank god it &apos;s <T_4> -- i get <T_6> go back <T_2> that little <T_9> , <T_3> fake gray <T_5> , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations <T_8> or <T_7> hours <T_1> then <T_0> home .
<T_1> &apos;s about <T_0> meters by three , <T_3> you <T_2> all <T_4> any time .
in <T_4> , there is <T_3> text , and that <T_2> over a <T_5> uses of <T_1> first <T_0> .
<T_3> was an <T_2> . <T_4> &apos;s all <T_1> knew . <T_0> &apos;s all i &apos;d done .
now , you &apos;ve <T_4> video like this <T_8> tv a <T_0> , and <T_7> &apos;s <T_5> intimidating , and <T_3> think it gives <T_2> wrong <T_1> about <T_6> .
and of course , alexander <T_2> &apos;t sustain a government <T_0> it <T_1> .
<T_1> we need <T_2> have early detection , early <T_0> .
and when <T_1> bronx <T_6> president shows up and <T_7> state <T_3> comes to our <T_8> , <T_4> you <T_2> , <T_5> bronx can change <T_0> now .
schlaug found that his stroke <T_3> who were <T_7> , could not form sentences of three- or four-word <T_9> , <T_6> they could still <T_1> the <T_8> to a song , whether it was &quot; happy <T_5> to you &quot; or their favorite song by <T_4> eagles <T_2> the rolling <T_0> .
like , if <T_2> &apos;d lost <T_1> leg , well , you get <T_0> back .
so if <T_0> want to see the <T_1> side , <T_3> can <T_4> and see <T_2> behind .
<T_2> so <T_1> decided to call the track coach at <T_0> .
<T_3> &apos;s the <T_1> place <T_0> you can produce , actually , <T_2> .
<T_1> am <T_2> extinct -- i &apos;m a <T_0> who <T_3> .
and <T_3> idea <T_4> that <T_2> design would inspire manufacturers and other <T_1> of influence <T_5> take this model <T_0> it .
and <T_2> then people get very <T_1> results <T_4> they do <T_3> this <T_0> .
<T_3> years ago , when i started <T_4> to <T_1> intel to let <T_6> go start looking at disruptive <T_5> that could help with independent <T_2> , this is what <T_8> called <T_0> : &quot; <T_7> + 10 . &quot;
<T_4> you imitate <T_0> , <T_1> you <T_2> have an <T_3> on it .
i could not get <T_3> thing <T_4> work no <T_2> how <T_5> or <T_0> hard <T_1> blew into it .
<T_0> i was <T_2> , &quot; <T_3> . <T_4> is <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go <T_0> it .
of <T_3> , there are the bases , which refer to specific <T_7> activities <T_0> happen in a very specific order , ultimately <T_6> in scoring a run <T_2> hitting a <T_8> run , which <T_9> usually having <T_5> intercourse to the point <T_1> orgasm , at least <T_4> the guy .
<T_6> this is the brain region <T_9> used when <T_4> saw the <T_7> i showed you , or when <T_5> read romeo and <T_8> or <T_3> you <T_0> to <T_2> alan <T_1> .
and <T_4> look <T_1> the future <T_7> , <T_6> what <T_8> want to <T_2> with <T_9> doggy stuff , is to <T_0> people <T_5> you know , your husband &apos;s just <T_3> easy to train .
<T_1> was <T_0> hot . <T_2> was very hungry .
and <T_0> other <T_1> unbelievable <T_2> .
<T_1> i <T_3> sense that <T_2> thought i <T_0> speaking synecdochically .
<T_9> : <T_7> then <T_5> a <T_8> dip into some liquid <T_0> to get <T_4> perfect sear , we really have <T_2> that looks , <T_3> and <T_1> like <T_6> real thing .
now let &apos;s ask <T_3> , <T_1> could such <T_2> say about <T_4> to people 4,000 <T_5> into <T_0> future ?
doing projects <T_2> this is <T_0> them <T_3> of <T_1> .
<T_4> he <T_3> completely convinced <T_0> his <T_2> wide <T_1> would take over the world one <T_5> .
if you look in <T_0> , you see <T_5> completely <T_7> , something <T_1> pretty much <T_9> see , which is he becomes <T_4> famous and <T_2> all of a <T_6> plummets , going through a nadir between 1933 and <T_3> , before <T_8> afterward .
the next <T_0> question is , <T_1> or <T_2> ?
<T_3> deer <T_0> an <T_1> leg . a flying <T_2> .
it <T_0> &apos;t look <T_1> anything &apos;s going on .
there <T_1> this guy <T_2> a book , <T_0> was in his <T_3> .
<T_3> i <T_4> this is <T_0> just <T_5> beginning <T_2> how we &apos;re going to treat <T_1> .
i <T_1> one <T_2> those . <T_3> was failed by my school -- my <T_0> failed me .
<T_5> are <T_1> going to do with <T_4> this research , besides studying the properties of <T_0> dynamic <T_2> that we have between <T_3> ears ?
so , <T_0> built a <T_1> that had <T_4> three <T_5> the hip height <T_2> the <T_6> that <T_3> &apos;re looking at .
they &apos;re one <T_0> the <T_1> subsea aviators .
that <T_0> one of <T_1> funnest moments of my <T_2> .
we <T_0> on <T_1> e. <T_2> boulevard .
but if <T_4> are in a reflective <T_7> , we <T_8> ask , &quot; is <T_9> the <T_5> expression of <T_0> balance with respect <T_3> variables like <T_6> and beauty <T_1> women &apos;s <T_2> ? &quot;
sometimes <T_0> was <T_3> words , no <T_2> , just <T_1> .
<T_9> seem to spend <T_6> of my time these days <T_1> from city <T_0> city , <T_2> to <T_3> , interview to interview , serving <T_8> the <T_5> in really <T_4> bite-size <T_7> .
so , a team <T_4> berkeley researchers <T_1> 15 <T_0> dollars <T_6> the gates <T_8> is engineering , designing <T_5> radical <T_2> way to make the key ingredient , called <T_9> , and they &apos;re going to make that <T_3> 10 times <T_7> .
this <T_2> the <T_0> of my <T_1> .
<T_0> you &apos;re looking at <T_1> it drapes over <T_3> differentiates from the <T_2> .
<T_3> is a <T_5> community site that &apos;s built by <T_0> community , linking and <T_2> this <T_1> social <T_4> market .
and <T_1> the kind of <T_2> of the <T_4> system , i <T_0> privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts <T_3> space <T_5> and other <T_6> in <T_7> .
<T_0> is <T_2> what we <T_1> them .
that is -- you <T_7> , there &apos;s <T_6> sentence that kind of conjures up that period <T_3> than that , <T_9> think , which <T_5> that you <T_4> have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to <T_8> , and somebody <T_1> the page has <T_0> power to click on that link or <T_2> click on that link .
so he <T_2> up at <T_1> university <T_0> chicago .
<T_9> we <T_8> find <T_6> the <T_5> genomes in me , or <T_7> genome <T_3> mine <T_4> want to use , will have <T_1> three million <T_0> in the <T_2> of that .
they &apos;re <T_0> to be more <T_1> .
and <T_5> are actually trying to block , in a <T_4> sense , this <T_3> of <T_0> greater <T_1> of <T_2> .
<T_1> we <T_3> , &quot; <T_2> , there &apos;s another <T_0> .
<T_2> she has a <T_0> of <T_1> .
<T_4> guys made <T_2> want to , like , &quot; i &apos;m going <T_5> do that <T_3> at <T_6> bar <T_0> tonight for <T_1> girl . &quot;
they come <T_1> their own ideas and their own theories , and unless <T_3> work with those , <T_0> you won &apos;t <T_9> able to shift them , <T_4> ? <T_8> i probably haven &apos;t shifted <T_6> ideas <T_2> how the <T_5> and <T_7> operates , either .
and <T_3> came very <T_6> because our <T_0> are so hard <T_8> fool -- they &apos;re high-resolution , and <T_4> &apos;re wired straight to our <T_7> , <T_9> you <T_1> &apos;t <T_5> them <T_2> easily .
now <T_7> reason <T_3> micro-entrepreneurs can sell <T_4> make a profit is they have <T_1> sell <T_2> single <T_5> in <T_0> pushcart or their <T_6> .
well , there &apos;s <T_2> and <T_1> . <T_3> that <T_0> appropriate <T_4> .
<T_2> , this <T_1> the <T_4> -- <T_0> materials <T_3> the point of view of the environment .
<T_5> other <T_0> , we can have <T_2> benefits <T_4> big <T_1> while <T_3> privacy .
now , how on earth <T_0> we get <T_6> a <T_3> like this , <T_1> we have 27 <T_5> people in slavery <T_2> the year <T_4> ?
and it turns out , i <T_3> up the <T_2> morning , and i <T_1> to <T_0> this .
<T_8> &apos;s <T_0> going to be like veiling my <T_4> from birth <T_2> just <T_3> good as teaching <T_5> to be <T_9> and well-educated in <T_7> context <T_1> men who do <T_6> women .
<T_2> china , india <T_1> pakistan going to <T_0> as <T_6> impacts generate <T_4> over <T_3> and <T_5> .
<T_3> lose 700,000 <T_1> a <T_2> in <T_0> u.s. from sudden <T_4> death .
so the <T_2> two <T_1> are breast cancer <T_0> prostate cancer .
so <T_0> is literally acting <T_2> a well-being partner , a health and fitness partner and service <T_1> .
now <T_3> looks <T_2> quite <T_4> , <T_0> let <T_1> now add some watercolors to it .
we &apos;ve <T_2> to create one of <T_0> largest <T_3> movements <T_1> history .
now , if the idea of bats <T_9> your belfry <T_6> you , and i <T_0> some people probably are feeling a little sick <T_8> at very <T_1> images of bats , that &apos;s <T_5> not that <T_4> , because here <T_7> western <T_2> , <T_3> have been demonized .
<T_8> funds <T_2> to <T_3> what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are <T_7> investing , but with a <T_0> -- because <T_6> a <T_9> forms around these funds , <T_1> it has at <T_5> and <T_4> places .
now <T_5> you don &apos;t like these <T_2> , and many of us don &apos;t -- i know i <T_9> &apos;t , and <T_0> still don &apos;t , even though i <T_6> them half the time , <T_8> quite aware <T_7> i &apos;m following <T_4> -- what <T_3> way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with <T_1> ?
<T_1> makes it <T_3> . <T_0> &apos;s happening right <T_2> .
i <T_7> the copenhagen subway map <T_2> i renamed <T_9> the stations <T_6> abstract musical provocations , and <T_5> players , who are synchronized <T_3> stopwatches , <T_8> the <T_4> , which are listed <T_1> minutes <T_0> the hour .
<T_0> out doing crossword puzzles <T_1> stave off <T_3> of the effects <T_2> alzheimer &apos;s .
<T_8> thus , as <T_7> started feeling <T_0> over <T_5> , <T_6> numbers <T_4> coming back , <T_2> that &apos;s actually becoming a <T_3> for conservation <T_1> namibia .
so <T_2> are <T_4> of the <T_3> they <T_6> cause <T_5> recently : <T_1> , wi-fi , toiletries <T_0> coffee .
and look <T_1> these <T_0> .
<T_3> video game industry in <T_1> became <T_0> 29 <T_2> business .
i <T_3> give a <T_2> lecture on <T_0> impact of women <T_4> the business <T_1> .
<T_4> is the <T_2> prime number we knew <T_1> 1996 , <T_0> very <T_5> year for <T_3> .
<T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> falling <T_2> .
<T_5> : well , i <T_9> i had <T_4> half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and i also knew that <T_7> chances were that <T_0> i <T_8> , <T_6> would only <T_1> a <T_3> of minutes <T_2> life left .
i <T_0> &apos;t go into the <T_4> that &apos;s in the <T_1> , but <T_2> still had <T_5> neurologic <T_3> .
<T_2> had been misidentified <T_0> an 11-year-old <T_1> .
<T_0> also use &#91; an &#93; <T_1> medical record system .
<T_0> . who here , it <T_2> nothing <T_1> them ?
i <T_0> past 40 <T_2> my father <T_1> .
<T_4> it <T_3> strange <T_0> nature would have so <T_1> elementary <T_2> .
<T_4> is <T_0> true , <T_5> if <T_3> were , <T_2> would be incredibly <T_1> .
and these <T_1> are faced with <T_0> real problem .
<T_1> one &apos;s <T_0> good . <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> .
one of the things he <T_2> about was that <T_1> particle accelerator experiment <T_5> go <T_0> and set off a <T_4> reaction that would destroy <T_3> world .
<T_1> . <T_0> you .
they control <T_1> , among other <T_0> .
<T_7> first <T_1> is to use <T_9> epilepsy responsive <T_2> , called <T_6> , for <T_4> neurostimulator -- that &apos;s <T_5> brilliant <T_8> -- <T_0> the treatment of <T_3> brain disorders .
peace <T_0> not &quot; <T_1> , <T_2> lord . &quot;
the <T_0> to change the <T_3> are <T_1> everybody &apos;s <T_2> .
i <T_1> the <T_3> of working on death <T_0> in <T_2> maximum security &#91; prison &#93; <T_4> six years .
you &apos;ll get to <T_1> the incredible &#91; chambal &#93; <T_0> as well .
<T_1> is truer <T_2> truth ? <T_3> : the <T_0> .
and <T_5> this , of course , one of <T_0> themes for us is that <T_4> think that <T_1> and brutal <T_6> is critical <T_2> us <T_7> being great <T_3> .
now , you may be wondering , you may be wondering why i &apos;m clapping .
and i <T_2> , &quot; <T_3> . &quot; <T_5> he <T_1> , &quot; <T_4> can &apos;t <T_0> ? &quot;
the <T_3> orion ship and what it <T_7> take <T_0> do <T_6> orion does <T_5> chemicals : <T_4> have <T_2> ship the <T_1> of the empire state <T_8> .
<T_1> one-eyed <T_2> recognized the woman , a <T_0> .
<T_3> have just been talking <T_0> the <T_1> of <T_2> leone .
<T_2> then finally , it occurred to some <T_0> to step back and <T_8> , well <T_4> , but <T_6> , <T_7> do <T_5> regret <T_3> in <T_1> ?
<T_6> now , <T_4> our third <T_2> , <T_0> may be <T_5> for us to <T_3> back to <T_8> we <T_1> and <T_7> it for the first time .
now <T_7> &apos;m an <T_4> , i &apos;m not a <T_6> , but <T_1> see <T_3> god complex <T_0> me all <T_5> time in <T_2> fellow economists .
right <T_0> .
<T_1> it can only use <T_0> much <T_2> . &quot;
so , i had to use my <T_2> to hold <T_5> feet <T_0> the <T_6> that were <T_1> , <T_4> was <T_7> real <T_8> for <T_3> .
<T_3> very ominous <T_1> he took <T_0> nearby to the lake , conveniently called lake <T_2> baines <T_4> .
<T_1> was going to be a <T_2> . i <T_0> it all <T_3> out .
<T_1> , there <T_2> is calling to <T_0> friends .
i <T_2> , of <T_4> people that build all <T_5> technology <T_6> the <T_0> , a lot of them <T_7> &apos;t very <T_1> at connecting with <T_3> .
at <T_0> point i decided to make <T_1> pause .
<T_0> one taught <T_5> to <T_1> this into <T_2> hook , had <T_4> her <T_3> it could happen .
all the conversation <T_3> . <T_2> the eyes <T_0> to <T_1> .
<T_1> that &apos;s a <T_0> opportunity , <T_3> would say , <T_2> design .
<T_2> &apos;re powerful <T_0> to cut <T_1> in half .
<T_8> , you can see <T_6> 2006 , they raised <T_1> three quarters of a chick per <T_4> , and <T_9> can see <T_0> they &apos;re <T_5> to <T_7> tombo ; <T_3> &apos;re not going as far <T_2> .
<T_0> has <T_7> be able <T_1> come <T_3> of <T_2> centerline and <T_6> be able to work <T_5> toward that <T_4> .
so <T_1> was <T_0> 20th <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;ll lead <T_2> through , to see how this <T_0> .
<T_1> u.s. has recently <T_0> legislation to <T_2> bribery <T_3> misconduct <T_4> the congo .
<T_4> to teach them , <T_0> me , <T_3> be a fantastic <T_7> , <T_5> it <T_1> be something that <T_2> would certainly put my <T_6> into .
only <T_1> can actually <T_0> resources .
we <T_4> hundreds of <T_1> to go to the wards <T_0> talk to people <T_3> the fact that they would <T_6> , and <T_5> would they <T_7> under those <T_2> .
i &apos;m <T_0> saying <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> nice <T_7> pleasant <T_6> that it &apos;s <T_2> for polar bears <T_4> forests , though it <T_5> is .
<T_0> came up with <T_2> structure <T_1> .
you <T_0> it all together <T_3> mash <T_4> up <T_1> the value <T_2> that way .
<T_0> these <T_1> individuals , most of them are <T_3> and <T_4> of them will have the <T_2> .
and <T_8> think that the way you &apos;re going <T_7> get <T_2> you <T_1> , <T_3> cause the change that you want to change , to <T_9> , <T_6> that you &apos;ve got to figure out a <T_5> to get <T_4> ideas <T_0> spread .
<T_2> van <T_0> : <T_1> i chose a gun
<T_1> &apos;re going to make all that stuff go <T_0> .
it &apos;s also shown us that something as <T_0> as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality , because facts , like people , want to be free , and when <T_9> &apos;re free , liberty is usually around the corner , even for <T_2> poorest of the poor -- facts that can challenge cynicism <T_1> the apathy that leads to inertia , facts that tell us what &apos;s working and , more <T_6> , what &apos;s not , <T_7> we can <T_8> it , facts that <T_3> we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made back in 2005 , when <T_5> asked us to be <T_4> great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity , extreme poverty , facts that build a powerful momentum .
<T_4> yes , <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> fun , <T_0> yes , you <T_5> all go out and try <T_2> .
<T_6> did <T_0> advertising campaign for <T_2> , which is coca-cola , <T_3> so that was very <T_1> in <T_5> of the <T_4> .
and <T_1> we had been <T_7> in caring <T_0> sharing , <T_2> had the <T_5> that <T_6> and <T_3> would have a chance <T_4> the <T_8> .
what <T_3> knew before is that there was <T_2> million times the mass of the sun <T_1> that <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_0> slim volume ; i &apos;m not sure if you &apos;ve seen <T_1> .
i woke up the <T_0> after <T_2> gave that talk <T_3> the <T_4> vulnerability hangover of <T_1> life .
<T_1> the charm of <T_0> truffles <T_2> in their <T_3> .
now <T_5> doesn &apos;t sound <T_8> a lot , <T_9> it &apos;s very <T_4> , because being able to deliver the <T_3> as a light sport <T_1> makes it simpler <T_0> us to certify it , but it also makes it <T_2> easier for <T_6> to <T_7> how to fly it .
<T_2> bet <T_3> didn &apos;t know , <T_1> takes about <T_4> pints of <T_5> to <T_6> a <T_0> of beer .
but <T_0> can be opened for <T_1> people .
<T_5> section of <T_8> family <T_0> their clothing , as <T_4> to their <T_1> presence , <T_7> they didn &apos;t <T_6> to be identified with the <T_2> that <T_3> was highlighting .
let <T_2> confirm <T_0> she <T_1> .
<T_0> idea of <T_8> , <T_5> gives <T_4> to our lives and gives us <T_2> feeling <T_7> what &apos;s right about life , what &apos;s <T_3> about <T_6> , what should <T_9> be doing , <T_1> justice .
<T_2> tackling <T_1> impossible , you make the <T_0> possible .
now <T_3> you <T_4> this robot to do <T_0> different <T_2> , that &apos;s another three-year ph.d. <T_1> .
we <T_1> &apos;t do <T_0> right now .
<T_0> they <T_2> created <T_5> digital puppet of <T_9> , where you can pull <T_3> these various <T_4> , and it actually <T_6> her face in ways <T_7> are <T_8> consistent with <T_1> scans that we took .
<T_0> is a video installation <T_3> &quot; <T_1> missing <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> i said , <T_7> , <T_3> here <T_9> out i &apos;m <T_6> going on <T_5> where <T_4> know <T_8> there &apos;s wi-fi , <T_1> i &apos;m bringing my <T_0> .
<T_1> could change the genes in <T_0> .
so we know <T_7> , we know <T_1> and vegetables , even some alfalfa <T_6> hay that the livestock for the meats that <T_8> eat , rely on pollinators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and <T_5> pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a <T_0> will visit some flowers <T_9> pick up some <T_3> , or <T_2> male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to <T_4> flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
<T_2> &apos;s in its <T_0> of attendant <T_1> ?
it <T_2> gang-infested , <T_0> teacher turnover <T_1> .
came to see <T_5> and <T_1> , &quot; 1,600 of the <T_3> that <T_0> &apos;ve sent out have <T_4> back missing at least <T_2> full <T_6> .
<T_9> if i was a young <T_7> , <T_0> in a violent <T_3> , you know , a 14 year old , and <T_2> want <T_8> find a <T_6> , i &apos;d <T_4> some tough <T_5> , right , to <T_1> me .
the <T_0> says , &quot; i <T_1> a second <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> , it <T_0> good , it <T_3> good , it <T_1> good .
<T_4> if we <T_7> figure out a way to deal <T_3> that <T_0> , <T_8> are going to find ourselves <T_2> and <T_1> and more quickly facing <T_5> which are simply <T_6> .
it <T_4> too <T_1> to have decentralized <T_5> production , to have decentralized <T_0> in society . <T_2> was <T_3> about society itself .
so <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> lauren <T_1> .
<T_2> grand <T_0> is really <T_1> .
and <T_0> the end of a <T_4> , <T_5> would sometimes <T_3> that i <T_1> photographs <T_6> told a <T_2> story than a sometimes-sensational <T_7> .
<T_3> can see <T_0> range of the <T_1> . it &apos;s here , in <T_2> .
<T_2> i would <T_1> want to <T_0> you of that <T_3> .
<T_0> is a car seat that was installed <T_2> someone who has installed 1,000 <T_4> seats , who <T_1> exactly <T_3> to do it .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> 78 degrees <T_0> .
i <T_0> a body surfer <T_3> i thought , &quot; <T_4> , <T_5> was <T_2> incredible <T_1> ! &quot;
so what <T_2> did is we <T_0> two <T_1> side-by-side .
<T_2> kid <T_1> no patience for <T_0> .
<T_1> children looked <T_2> were <T_0> .
so <T_1> turns out <T_2> propulsion isn &apos;t really the <T_0> .
and it &apos;s interesting , by doing <T_7> in this sort of rendered <T_2> , <T_9> stronger the illusions are . any case , i <T_1> this has brought you <T_5> little joy <T_4> happiness , and if you &apos;re <T_0> in seeing more cool effects , see me <T_6> . <T_8> &apos;d be happy to show you <T_3> of things .
the <T_1> there <T_0> india .
this <T_2> the <T_4> road connecting <T_3> chinese <T_0> and the <T_1> empire .
and <T_0> didn &apos;t die <T_1> they didn &apos;t have <T_2> anymore .
<T_3> only do they suppress <T_2> dopamine circuit , but they kill <T_0> sex <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;re <T_2> strongly <T_1> opinions .
<T_1> adoptive <T_0> were lined up .
thank you .
<T_4> geographic <T_3> did a roper <T_2> of 18 to 26 year olds <T_1> our <T_0> and in <T_5> other <T_6> .
o.k. , so , everyone <T_0> a <T_1> .
and <T_1> you turn <T_2> switch off , the <T_0> goes off .
when <T_2> wants to <T_0> you <T_4> car , they &apos;re telling <T_1> a <T_3> .
a <T_1> isn &apos;t going to <T_0> you if you <T_2> it .
in <T_4> future they will <T_8> like that , because <T_3> need to move <T_1> from those type of <T_5> and use that <T_9> medical <T_7> and more <T_0> things , <T_6> , <T_2> life .
we &apos;re reading <T_0> book of <T_1> .
<T_5> don &apos;t press <T_6> luck about <T_0> much those <T_3> do <T_4> in <T_2> actually <T_1> it .
<T_3> we were going <T_1> the <T_4> back <T_2> the airport , <T_6> were thinking : why <T_0> this so <T_5> ?
<T_0> the <T_1> of it threw <T_2> for a loop .
<T_6> of the matter <T_0> you can <T_3> the piano <T_2> a cochlear <T_1> , <T_7> all you have to do is press the <T_5> at <T_4> right <T_8> .
every <T_3> any <T_2> came to the <T_4> , she <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_5> we look at the bed <T_2> , <T_0> can see <T_4> they sleep <T_3> a <T_6> on the <T_1> .
which <T_1> , <T_3> think , gets into <T_4> little bit <T_0> our current <T_2> .
all of <T_0> speakers , by the way , are <T_1> women , <T_2> or 19 <T_3> old .
and it <T_2> just using <T_1> hydro <T_3> match the hour-by-hour power <T_0> .
<T_0> do you know <T_1> the <T_2> thing is ?
<T_5> i <T_8> talk <T_4> it <T_6> day -- just <T_7> my <T_1> -- but i <T_0> to move on to something <T_3> &apos;s kind of <T_2> interesting .
<T_1> two most <T_4> largest <T_0> of our <T_3> are <T_2> internet and the mobile phone .
<T_0> most <T_2> don &apos;t even know they <T_1> .
<T_7> fundamental <T_3> is <T_4> politicians are given <T_1> to <T_5> for <T_8> , to make <T_0> on <T_2> behalf that <T_6> us all .
would <T_1> wonder <T_3> i <T_2> , <T_0> thought .
<T_3> only <T_4> in <T_0> flocks is <T_1> loss of <T_2> mating .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_3> it for <T_4> freedom <T_1> this gives us as <T_0> &apos;re going around .
<T_2> it so happened he was speaking <T_0> a <T_1> church .
what <T_1> hadn &apos;t counted on was digitization , because that meant that all <T_7> paper receipts had been scanned in electronically , and <T_5> was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database , put it on <T_4> disk , and then just saunter outside of parliament , which they <T_8> , <T_2> then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder , which was <T_6> daily telegraph , and then , you all remember , there was weeks <T_0> weeks of revelations , everything from porn movies and bath plugs <T_3> new kitchens and <T_9> that had never been paid off .
<T_0> him some <T_1> . &quot;
so <T_4> males will go <T_2> , they &apos;ll look for <T_3> , <T_0> &apos;ll mate . if they mate <T_1> , <T_6> no <T_5> .
<T_2> is no <T_3> of <T_1> in <T_0> experience .
and <T_0> points <T_1> there .
<T_3> is a <T_1> that &apos;s been <T_4> to respond <T_2> a trumpet <T_0> food .
<T_3> , <T_1> know from <T_2> &apos; 60s , you &apos;re either on the bus <T_0> you &apos;re off the <T_4> .
and <T_7> have <T_3> very vibrant <T_2> in <T_0> , <T_6> , <T_4> also emerging in <T_1> and other <T_5> of the world .
it &apos;s hard to get <T_9> to envision themselves as a scientist , <T_3> involves standing up <T_8> front of <T_1> like we &apos;re doing here <T_7> this symposium <T_2> presenting something <T_4> a knowledgeable person , and then seeing yourself in the <T_0> as a scientist and giving yourself <T_5> tools <T_6> pursue that .
<T_4> pat metheny <T_3> jim <T_1> were there <T_2> they recorded with <T_0> .
<T_1> actually get <T_3> chance to <T_5> not to <T_6> products <T_0> have dangerous , <T_2> plastic <T_4> them .
but what is interesting <T_7> that we <T_2> &apos;t need to talk <T_3> design and <T_4> anymore ; <T_0> uses whatever <T_8> it has at its <T_1> in order <T_6> make <T_5> point .
any of <T_1> can be <T_0> up .
once you get to that point where <T_1> know it &apos;s going to happen , you need to <T_7> thinking about how <T_3> &apos;re going to let go because <T_5> is the critical <T_8> of not getting hurt -- how you &apos;re going to fall onto the rope , or <T_0> you &apos;re climbing without a rope , <T_4> to a <T_2> where you <T_6> actually control <T_9> fall .
the <T_1> little diagram of it <T_4> , <T_2> &apos;re up here , and <T_5> are pushing it out <T_3> the <T_0> .
by the <T_3> , <T_0> secret <T_6> not to <T_1> to sleep <T_4> you &apos;ve written your words <T_2> the <T_5> .
anyways , <T_0> ... <T_1> to start ?
and that , in <T_1> , turns <T_0> to be <T_2> .
he &apos;s making <T_1> great <T_0> .
most recently , we &apos;ve been <T_2> reminded <T_4> the <T_0> power <T_1> nature <T_6> with <T_3> recent earthquake <T_5> haiti .
it <T_1> 80 <T_2> u.s. <T_0> .
now , if you &apos;re <T_3> longer <T_5> traffic cop -- the <T_8> with being <T_6> traffic cop is there can <T_9> be so many traffic <T_0> in any <T_4> intersection , <T_7> the <T_1> get confused . <T_2> ?
<T_4> is : there &apos;s <T_1> science of <T_5> , <T_2> almost <T_0> that &apos;s run is mastered to <T_6> amazing <T_3> .
<T_2> first is <T_1> really crazy project <T_6> we &apos;re building right now , called death <T_5> the powers . <T_7> it &apos;s <T_0> big opera , <T_9> of the <T_3> opera projects going on in <T_8> world right <T_4> .
what <T_0> can <T_2> us , it &apos;s by building <T_1> .
<T_0> said , &quot; well , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> of neat .
so here is <T_0> of <T_1> .
<T_2> of <T_0> , <T_3> &apos;m sure , will be <T_1> with <T_4> .
now , where do you <T_0> such goldilocks <T_1> ?
and <T_3> injury , blood vessels actually have to <T_0> under <T_1> scab in <T_2> to <T_4> .
and <T_1> -- actually , once it was <T_7> page <T_6> in the <T_0> , that <T_4> was cruising this guy , like , sort of , whatever , but <T_3> was <T_8> just <T_2> because <T_9> had these really <T_5> shoes on .
<T_3> so now we can <T_1> , is <T_2> really a <T_0> signature ?
in 1941 , the burnished <T_5> of an all-american <T_4> glove inspired the <T_6> of coach to create <T_3> new <T_2> from <T_1> same luxuriously soft <T_7> .
<T_9> so the <T_4> that <T_6> might not have birds became kind of <T_5> to <T_3> of us <T_1> around looking <T_2> the <T_8> that seemed <T_7> have <T_0> disappeared .
<T_2> backpack goes ballistic <T_1> some <T_0> direction .
<T_2> one more <T_3> : <T_0> was suffering from <T_1> illness himself .
and <T_4> of <T_0> models -- so you <T_2> a bit <T_1> this <T_3> valve tube , <T_7> can put two matchsticks inside this , and <T_5> make a <T_6> joint .
in <T_2> , he <T_9> the white <T_3> , <T_8> said , &quot; i would <T_0> to fund a <T_4> to create scalable national applications , apps , that <T_5> help not only the homeless but <T_7> who deliver <T_1> &#91; to &#93; them to do so <T_6> . &quot;
you need to <T_5> the <T_2> principles <T_3> nature , and then use these <T_0> when <T_1> &apos;re <T_4> .
now , <T_1> turns out burst-pulsed sounds <T_0> look a bit <T_3> human <T_2> .
<T_2> looked at <T_0> sitting <T_1> to me .
guards get <T_4> to clean the <T_1> out with their <T_5> <T_0> , to do other <T_3> tasks <T_2>
so <T_2> is <T_0> cotton <T_1> .

<T_1> else , after all , is <T_0> ?
<T_2> is <T_1> of the way <T_0> live .
<T_4> these voices <T_6> so persistent and so <T_3> that <T_1> started to legitimately fear for my life , <T_8> is the time that i said to myself after <T_7> days -- and i will <T_2> forget this moment -- i <T_5> , i am either going <T_9> kill <T_0> or i &apos;m going to turn this into a game .
crows have <T_1> highly <T_2> at making a living <T_4> these <T_0> urban <T_3> .
there is <T_2> about clothes , i <T_0> , <T_1> shoes .

and <T_7> you find yourself worried that <T_3> like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of <T_8> , you <T_9> be interested to know that social mobility , <T_6> of the things we really pride ourselves <T_2> in the united states , is now lower than it is in <T_4> northern european countries that have <T_1> very generous <T_0> safety <T_5> .
and <T_6> , that &apos;s not <T_0> . <T_7> can adjust <T_3> position like this , and <T_4> , and <T_2> freely moves in <T_5> new <T_1> .

and , i noticed <T_5> most inventions <T_8> , not because <T_3> r &amp; <T_2> ; d department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually <T_1> if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to <T_7> -- and 90 percent of those projects <T_6> more will fail , <T_0> the <T_4> is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will <T_9> in place when they &apos;re needed .
<T_1> i <T_3> , &quot; <T_2> , how do you <T_0> it ? &quot;
<T_2> i <T_1> these aren &apos;t just <T_0> components <T_3> remixing .
and , in addition , the <T_2> doctrine <T_8> the periphery , the idea <T_7> israel &apos;s security <T_0> best achieved <T_3> creating alliances <T_6> the non-arab <T_5> in the <T_9> of the region in order to <T_4> the arab <T_1> in its vicinity .
and <T_1> the <T_2> into <T_0> materials .
<T_1> indeed , this is probably historical , and it <T_0> its time .
<T_0> may never experience <T_2> entire <T_1> yourself .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> about stem cells <T_2> .
and <T_0> talked <T_1> this throughout the entire <T_2> .
<T_0> this is when great-grandma was <T_1> , <T_2> .
in <T_5> , the <T_1> was but <T_2> dream , <T_4> few sketches <T_0> a piece of <T_3> .
and a <T_2> months <T_0> that , there was a white american guy <T_9> austin , <T_5> who flew his <T_6> into the irs <T_1> , <T_7> i happened <T_8> be in austin <T_4> day doing a stand-up <T_3> show .
and <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> part , <T_2> ascending <T_5> , which <T_3> and <T_4> bursts , which , of course , is <T_6> .
a <T_1> of years ago , a <T_3> comes into <T_0> israel deaconess medical center for a <T_2> .
and <T_0> can <T_1> here a very good <T_2> .
<T_2> i took <T_4> family -- we <T_1> these rather kind of <T_0> mathematical <T_5> , which my <T_3> love .
<T_0> from organisms . <T_6> is a session <T_3> water -- learning <T_2> organisms that can do <T_1> water , in order <T_4> create <T_7> vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts <T_5> refrigeration .
<T_1> , <T_0> video .
we <T_2> the peg legs there , <T_1> are all handmade <T_0> fitted <T_3> you .
<T_0> i was <T_4> that in the field , so every <T_1> i would watch <T_3> and think of <T_2> .
but <T_1> only need to <T_0> them once .
they <T_2> this <T_0> &apos;t good enough and they <T_1> to get it up to <T_3> .
they <T_0> me , &quot; <T_2> girl with <T_1> beard . &quot;
<T_8> taught <T_2> about what a <T_0> marriage <T_4> like : that it &apos;s built <T_1> faith <T_7> commitment and <T_5> admiration for each <T_6> &apos;s unique <T_3> .
you <T_0> the <T_4> of <T_5> on the left , so we <T_2> think of vishnu <T_1> the <T_3> god .
it was <T_3> my <T_0> and <T_4> huge <T_2> that comes with <T_1> .
on <T_0> overflow , it <T_5> a <T_2> playing field , enabling the <T_3> with the real <T_1> to rise to the <T_4> .
and now <T_7> designed <T_8> reasonably <T_0> , but <T_1> &apos;s exactly <T_6> they are lasting <T_4> long <T_5> still <T_2> all the <T_3> data .
<T_2> i &apos;m not <T_1> to <T_0> here , no .
<T_3> : <T_5> is <T_1> fair . <T_4> is <T_0> trick question . he &apos;s not up <T_2> , is <T_6> ?
let &apos;s see what <T_0> here think <T_1> it .
some <T_3> that we met on facebook never been in israel , <T_7> and raised in <T_0> , <T_2> in germany , afraid of israelis because of <T_9> she knows about us , decides after a few months <T_8> talking on <T_1> internet <T_4> some israelis to come to israel , and she gets on <T_5> plane and arrives at ben gurion and says , &quot; okay , not that big a <T_6> . &quot;
and so i fell <T_7> love with this , <T_3> said look , we have <T_6> this <T_1> about <T_5> . <T_4> hard <T_0> it <T_2> ?
<T_0> they <T_1> these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles .
<T_4> people are <T_2> this information , <T_6> we <T_5> go to the <T_0> of presenting it to <T_7> <T_1> a form that they can <T_3> with .
<T_1> : now <T_4> are <T_0> other <T_3> that are worth 500 <T_2> words .
it <T_1> me <T_0> .
<T_2> what this <T_6> consists of is <T_1> large <T_4> that <T_7> a good <T_0> time <T_3> contract , and a latch that prevents <T_8> from <T_5> .
they <T_2> them <T_0> , and then they <T_1> .
how do you <T_0> that ?
and as <T_8> think about <T_3> mesh <T_0> i think about , well , what &apos;s driving it , <T_4> come it &apos;s <T_1> now , <T_9> think <T_6> &apos;s a <T_7> of vectors that <T_5> want to give you as <T_2> .
<T_0> are you allowed to <T_1> or <T_2> say ?
<T_4> we find is that there is <T_3> great deal of wasted <T_5> information <T_7> there <T_2> just too much <T_6> for <T_1> to actually do <T_0> with right now .
<T_0> inner circle <T_2> the <T_1> &apos;re focused <T_3> .
<T_0> i tried typing words on <T_1> laptop <T_4> using its <T_2> in <T_3> .
part of it <T_0> that <T_3> materials are macroscopic in <T_1> , but they &apos;re formed at <T_2> nanoscale .
<T_0> &apos;ll <T_3> you how to <T_2> to this <T_1> .
<T_0> quickly , <T_2> two-digit number <T_1> .
<T_2> are in <T_0> of <T_1> across the u.s .
<T_1> you shouldn &apos;t <T_0> people <T_3> their <T_2> edges .
<T_3> english <T_1> tsunami , washing away <T_2> languages ? not <T_0> .
<T_0> said yorktown on the <T_1> .
so <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> the midden workers <T_0> .
<T_1> way to think about <T_4> , though , <T_2> to think , <T_0> do they <T_3> ?
the <T_1> here , though , is <T_7> the <T_3> men and <T_2> are sticking <T_4> 97 words on average that <T_5> written very , very <T_9> , even <T_8> it <T_0> not <T_6> like it all the time .
<T_0> : <T_1> .
if <T_0> government <T_4> find out how <T_2> voted , they <T_3> &apos;t be able <T_1> .
and i was <T_0> fascinated with sharks .
<T_0> another group of <T_3> , we told them , &quot; <T_2> and <T_1> will see your <T_4> . &quot;
in <T_0> , take a <T_1> .
so <T_3> can <T_1> and <T_0> each other at a <T_2> .
so <T_8> you <T_3> not know <T_0> that nowadays while you &apos;re typing <T_5> captcha , <T_1> only are you authenticating yourself as a <T_2> , <T_6> in addition you &apos;re actually helping <T_7> to <T_4> books .
<T_2> tell <T_3> , &quot; you are <T_4> to make it , and you will raise <T_0> healthy <T_1> . &quot;
and <T_0> became <T_1> ongoing thing . more and <T_2> books .
and by <T_2> weird <T_0> of alphabetical order of the <T_1> , a lot of <T_3> low-lying states , <T_8> kiribati <T_7> nauru , they were seated <T_4> very end of these immensely <T_5> rows <T_6>
she <T_1> she would have to <T_4> that <T_0> man , <T_3> she <T_2> 14 .
in <T_4> short talk , psychologist <T_6> ariely tells two <T_7> stories that explore <T_8> conflict of interest : how the pursuit of knowledge <T_9> insight can be <T_1> , consciously or <T_0> , by shortsighted <T_5> goals . when we &apos;re thinking about the big questions , he reminds <T_3> , let &apos;s be aware <T_2> our all-too-human brains .
<T_3> repaired <T_1> feelings that <T_2> have escalated <T_0> permanent hostility .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> picture by paul <T_0> .
<T_2> stir <T_1> in until <T_0> &apos;s completely <T_3> and then pour <T_4> into a growth <T_5> .
but <T_1> is a problem of <T_0> incentives , just incentives .
<T_1> hope <T_3> &apos;ll <T_5> , tweet and <T_0> some seeds to pollinate <T_2> friendly <T_4> .
i &apos;ve got this <T_0> , <T_1> &apos;m <T_2> the <T_3> , you know .
that &apos;s <T_1> a sign <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;s not , <T_1> , totally <T_6> that she &apos;s the first <T_4> , <T_2> actually , she <T_3> something more <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;re going to win <T_1> the <T_3> that <T_2> from our <T_0> actually come from our <T_4> .
<T_1> , we <T_0> figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce <T_4> , <T_2> the <T_3> 1940s .
but what &apos;s very <T_3> is that , <T_0> our <T_2> , we <T_1> always see the earth <T_4>
i mean , you had to queue <T_5> get proper <T_1> to attend -- and that &apos;s <T_0> i call proper , when four of <T_4> are <T_2> a <T_3> .
so <T_0> you are done , just <T_4> back <T_5> body <T_1> then it &apos;s ready <T_3> another <T_2> .
<T_1> : <T_0> .
pshhew .
how <T_0> we tell this <T_1> that <T_2> ain &apos;t going to have a <T_3> ?
these <T_0> are <T_1> behaviors .
so , while i can &apos;t automatically <T_9> that britain will rush <T_1> the aid of <T_7> citizen of any country , in danger , <T_4> can say that <T_2> is in a position where we &apos;re working <T_3> other countries so that this <T_8> that you have a responsibility to protect <T_0> who are victims of either <T_5> or humanitarian attack , is something that is accepted by <T_6> whole world .
<T_7> &apos;ve written a number of <T_0> on the <T_4> of gaia hypothesis -- whether <T_3> not <T_9> could consider earth as <T_8> single entity <T_6> any meaningful scientific sense , and then , as an <T_2> of that , <T_5> worked on the environmental <T_1> of nuclear war .
<T_0> grandma <T_1> even more <T_2> .
so <T_1> patients are <T_0> and <T_2> .
<T_1> this is now <T_2> public <T_0> crisis .
<T_4> there , we actually carved up <T_3> faces <T_2> smaller pieces <T_0> components of his <T_1> .
i <T_1> at the <T_2> of the <T_0> .
<T_2> was <T_1> a <T_0> ride .
and <T_0> makes <T_2> possible , makes <T_1> rationalizable .
<T_6> for the <T_2> time we &apos;ve actually been able to record from <T_4> in the fly &apos;s <T_0> while the fly is performing <T_1> behaviors <T_5> as <T_3> .
<T_1> much -- what &apos;s the <T_0> revenue ?
so <T_7> went to the <T_0> , <T_6> golf <T_1> there , <T_3> we went <T_5> the largest feature <T_4> our own <T_2> .
and <T_0> , <T_2> towel per <T_5> for one <T_4> -- 571,230,000 pounds of <T_3> . no <T_1> thing .
<T_1> your beginnings <T_8> africa , <T_0> each <T_6> , may <T_3> passed on to you , <T_5> your creation . it &apos;s a secret <T_7> , <T_2> in you <T_4>
and <T_0> need <T_4> to <T_1> , and <T_2> can mean <T_3> things .
we <T_3> there are only <T_1> choices : <T_4> full <T_0> and <T_5> deployment or <T_2> isolation .
and <T_5> i <T_9> -- when i left <T_2> , when <T_6> left <T_0> , i told <T_3> , &quot; this <T_1> going to be something <T_8> i <T_4> to talk about <T_7>
<T_3> you have <T_4> that others are <T_1> to youtube , you <T_6> register <T_8> the <T_5> id system , <T_2> then you &apos;ll have <T_7> choice about how <T_0> content is <T_9> .
and he <T_1> everything <T_0> terms of -- <T_2> could read <T_3> binary <T_4> straight off <T_5> machine .
<T_1> , <T_2> a wonderful <T_0> . &quot;
&apos;70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . <T_3> have to stop <T_0> . <T_4> the <T_2> news is that we <T_1> .
<T_2> this <T_0> of course not <T_1> end of it .
<T_2> october , i <T_3> some <T_1> in <T_4> democratic <T_6> of congo , which is the &#91; second &#93; <T_5> country in <T_0> .
and <T_3> &apos;s about it , <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> they <T_0> .
<T_1> were markets <T_2> africa before the <T_0> stepped foot on the <T_3> .
so <T_1> might have a <T_0> idea , but we &apos;re <T_3> to share <T_2> with anybody else .
so <T_2> america , it <T_5> kind of ridiculous <T_3> they said <T_1> should go <T_4> high <T_0> .
i want <T_0> show you now , to <T_5> , just a <T_2> pictures <T_3> for me are <T_4> important <T_1> that direction .
a <T_4> is <T_0> fractal . and as <T_3> put out limbs , the limbs <T_5> into small <T_6> , <T_2> of the <T_1> .
<T_3> , i <T_1> what <T_8> of the <T_2> is <T_0> , in <T_6> , <T_7> the problem is <T_4> , <T_5> we understand it , it &apos;s <T_9> .
this is the use of <T_3> now <T_1> create drugs <T_0> other <T_5> in <T_4> bodies <T_6> we want to <T_2> .
sometimes <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> little bit more <T_1> .
we <T_1> at <T_5> point <T_4> social <T_2> for these <T_0> many <T_6> conditions is on the up <T_3> up .
<T_0> got <T_1> .
and he <T_4> , &quot; and did <T_5> take <T_1> shortcut <T_0> inverleith <T_2> to get <T_6> to the <T_3> ? &quot;
and <T_2> we <T_3> to slides <T_4> all <T_1> , here <T_0> go .
but <T_6> i &apos;d like to <T_2> about today <T_1> the <T_5> that this morning , about a <T_9> people on <T_0> -- <T_8> one out of every seven -- <T_3> up and didn &apos;t <T_4> know how to fill this <T_7> .
<T_6> would bet <T_1> more of <T_4> insure your <T_5> -- you &apos;re <T_2> buying insurance <T_0> having an extended <T_3> .
and <T_4> they &apos;ve got <T_7> ; they <T_1> it on <T_3> logging trucks or <T_5> mining trucks <T_2> the <T_0> where they <T_6> it .

so <T_1> want to <T_3> give you an example <T_2> how powerful collaborative <T_4> can be to change <T_0> .
<T_1> made <T_0> series of <T_2> .
<T_4> : <T_2> . ar : <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s not here . <T_5> your <T_0> .
and <T_0> bit that <T_2> , the <T_3> with your marks -- this <T_1> your encrypted <T_4> .
it <T_3> only one and a <T_1> days <T_0> the atlantic <T_2> .

<T_2> , <T_3> &apos;m going to start off with kind of the buzzkill <T_0> little <T_1> .
the <T_1> way to make <T_2> is with oil <T_0> petrochemicals .
now , there are <T_5> reasons for <T_9> lower on the food chain too , whether it &apos;s <T_3> deforestation of <T_6> amazon , or making <T_2> protein available , to the four billion <T_1> who live on <T_8> dollar <T_4> day -- not to <T_0> whatever ethical <T_7> people have .
so we go far <T_8> to <T_3> top of a mountain , <T_9> that <T_1> ourselves on a piece is <T_4> to give us the respite <T_5> need to sort the <T_7> , <T_6> chaotic everyday , <T_2> find ourselves <T_0> .

but <T_9> i &apos;m going to talk <T_8> access <T_0> food , <T_5> actually <T_3> year and <T_1> year and during <T_4> 2008 food crisis , there was <T_7> food on earth for <T_2> to have 2,700 <T_6> .
<T_8> comes , paints <T_2> wall <T_6> , leaves the <T_7> and <T_3> a message : &quot; army <T_1> people , <T_0> hand . <T_5> for <T_4> . &quot;

in the afghan section in london responsible for governing afghan <T_7> on the <T_4> , i was told <T_1> year <T_3> there was <T_6> a single staff <T_9> of the <T_2> office <T_0> that section who had ever served on a <T_8> in <T_5> .
<T_0> we started doing <T_8> . <T_9> you <T_4> see here on <T_5> horizontal <T_6> you &apos;ve got <T_7> number <T_1> people killed in an attack <T_2> the size of <T_3> attack .
imagine <T_3> into <T_4> garage -- <T_6> &apos;ve built a <T_1> to do this -- you <T_2> into <T_0> garage , and <T_8> car charges itself , because there is a <T_5> on the <T_7> that &apos;s plugged into the <T_9> .

<T_1> of all , <T_3> are pretty <T_2> , but <T_4> &apos;re also evolving <T_0> fast .
<T_6> what <T_3> loved about <T_5> image <T_2> compass <T_0> that i felt like it encapsulated <T_1> of these ideas in <T_4> simple <T_7> .
<T_3> then <T_4> breathed his last , with <T_7> ones around him , <T_6> i <T_0> that <T_5> had chicken <T_2> also , as <T_1> last <T_8> . &quot;

<T_2> will <T_0> an overwhelmingly <T_1> species .
we <T_1> — <T_0> you .
<T_0> i think <T_3> &apos;re <T_1> to see that , <T_4> it &apos;s making <T_5> job even <T_2> enjoyable .

basically , what they &apos;re doing is looking at biology <T_0> a <T_1> system .

thank you .
<T_1> then , a <T_2> behavior <T_0> comes up .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health <T_0> , <T_2> that concert <T_6> i had <T_5> opportunity <T_3> meet with him , <T_8> he gave his absolute <T_4> to <T_9> to making a change , <T_7> is absolutely <T_1> .
so <T_2> a final gesture <T_1> handed out <T_3> bracelets to all of <T_0> this morning .
so i <T_1> go back to my <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;d -- just <T_2> last thing i &apos;d <T_1> to <T_5> , <T_7> &apos;d , <T_3> -- <T_6> to <T_0> all of you for being here .
so <T_5> to cook , answering the <T_4> , writing <T_2> , <T_0> maybe <T_6> some <T_1> about this awesome <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> beautiful piece of <T_3> , but <T_2> is desolate , everything <T_0> dead .
<T_0> asked <T_1> why .
it <T_0> as <T_2> self-fulfilling <T_1> .
<T_1> because <T_5> have to be light and <T_6> , and <T_3> one of them is different , they <T_4> &apos;t <T_2> mass-produced , <T_0> .
<T_1> this <T_0> , too <T_2> .
<T_0> panbanisha does <T_1> unexpected .
so <T_0> had to <T_4> this in <T_7> submersible for quite <T_3> , <T_8> the top speed <T_6> this fish is one <T_1> , <T_2> was the top speed of <T_5> submersible .

<T_6> said <T_4> it &apos;s a <T_3> harder to <T_5> people <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> than <T_8> is to <T_0> them you &apos;re <T_7> .

because <T_2> &apos;s so <T_3> for people to think 50 <T_0> 100 <T_8> out , but when you can <T_7> them a toy , and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes , i think it &apos;s an <T_6> different kind of point of view , <T_5> we &apos;re actually mapping , using <T_9> game <T_1> re-map our <T_4> .
now , i <T_1> say one <T_0> that &apos;s very <T_2> .
<T_1> played the <T_2> without moving <T_0> body .
but <T_6> you get <T_0> , <T_7> you <T_3> ask about the <T_5> taxing <T_1> spending issues <T_2> consideration , <T_8> are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to <T_4> .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_3> the <T_2> costs of stopping <T_1> .
when <T_3> care for someone <T_0> dementia , and <T_5> get <T_2> , they train you to <T_1> them in activities that are <T_4> , hands-on , open-ended .
<T_4> , an ex-boyfriend of carol &apos;s <T_1> california had found <T_3> in <T_0> and was following <T_2> around .
just a couple <T_6> ago at facebook , <T_7> hosted a very <T_1> government official , <T_8> he <T_0> in <T_5> meet <T_3> senior <T_2> from around silicon <T_4> .
and <T_2> was actually rowing <T_4> my <T_6> here until <T_7> fateful <T_1> , and i <T_3> over right in front of <T_0> entire <T_5> .
that <T_1> are in <T_3> , and you &apos;re going <T_2> tell people <T_0> to <T_4> next .
so , <T_6> had this <T_0> , and i <T_2> , it &apos;s kind of <T_5> a <T_4> who &apos;s been on his <T_3> for <T_1> long .
you know , he <T_5> in <T_4> of his books : &quot; <T_3> yale student once <T_8> , &apos; i <T_2> here to <T_1> how <T_7> design , not how <T_9> use a computer . &apos; design <T_6> take <T_0> . &quot;
<T_5> digest our <T_2> , <T_0> make our <T_3> , <T_1> actually educate <T_6> immune system to keep bad <T_4> out .
so worldchanging.com , and building <T_5> blog , and <T_0> is a <T_1> , <T_8> i &apos;m <T_9> that it <T_4> &apos;t -- i don &apos;t see it as <T_2> kind of <T_3> where we &apos;re all going to follow <T_6> other to <T_7> .
the moment i really understood that <T_6> was happening , a friend of mine told me , &quot; google the <T_5> &apos; israel . &apos; &quot; and those <T_4> the <T_2> images on <T_3> days that popped <T_1> from google when <T_9> were typing , &quot; <T_0> &quot; <T_8> &quot; <T_7> . &quot;
it <T_1> energy in <T_0> mobile phones , playstations <T_2> laptops .
i <T_1> absolutely no <T_2> what was going <T_0> happen next .
<T_5> while getting <T_1> of crony capitalism <T_0> practice <T_3> really , really hard , at <T_4> intellectually , it &apos;s an easy <T_2> .
i <T_2> coming <T_0> from <T_6> big food <T_4> in <T_7> mosque where tens and tens <T_1> people <T_5> squatting in terrible <T_3> .
<T_1> didn &apos;t happen to <T_0> .
hooked it up <T_1> my laptop , and <T_4> about <T_3> minutes <T_5> had penetrated <T_2> computer security system of <T_6> major brazilian <T_0> .
<T_0> was <T_2> important , <T_3> in some sense , we &apos;ve lost <T_1> .
and <T_6> it finds <T_1> of those <T_5> , it grabs <T_0> sentence <T_9> to the period , <T_4> then automatically tries to deduce the <T_8> , gender and geographical <T_3> of the person <T_7> wrote that <T_2> .
<T_5> if <T_0> take eglantyne <T_4> , the woman <T_1> created <T_2> the <T_3> 90 years ago .
i <T_1> that <T_6> we want to discover <T_3> full <T_5> in our <T_7> , we need to <T_8> those heartbreaking <T_9> and those <T_0> disabilities that <T_4> all <T_2> .
<T_5> : well <T_6> &apos;m not ready to <T_0> up , but jim <T_2> i <T_3> there as he <T_7> , <T_9> i <T_8> , &quot; how <T_4> you feel about <T_1> ? &quot;
and <T_4> theory <T_1> that those 20 <T_3> have <T_2> do <T_0> the extra dimensions .
<T_2> was working with <T_3> very dangerous <T_1> about a year <T_0> .
<T_1> customers get to <T_0> huge co2 savings .
<T_0> can also do some <T_1> chan-motion , martial art movements . &quot;
<T_3> it <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> you <T_2> cake there and then .
millions <T_6> people have contributed their <T_1> computers when they &apos;re not using them <T_0> link together through <T_8> internet <T_5> supercomputing collectives that <T_2> solve the protein folding problem for medical <T_7> -- that &apos;s folding @ home <T_9> stanford -- <T_4> crack <T_3> , to search for life in outer space .
well , let &apos;s see now , <T_2> openness predicts <T_1> becomes <T_8> , <T_7> openness <T_6> who <T_3> a tedster , <T_5> might <T_9> predict <T_4> most <T_0> are liberal ?
<T_0> arguing ? <T_2> star on <T_1> one .
<T_0> happened <T_2> william <T_1> clinton ?
<T_2> later , as a <T_6> , i went <T_1> a <T_3> different <T_7> , <T_4> zoological garden <T_5> arnhem <T_0> we keep chimpanzees .
<T_7> the <T_9> story , god <T_3> sarah <T_0> could do something impossible and <T_2> laughed , <T_8> the <T_1> sarah , <T_6> didn &apos;t know what <T_5> do with <T_4> .
<T_9> that had <T_4> covered up for a long time <T_5> they <T_2> took the <T_3> rate <T_1> the number who <T_8> in senior year and <T_0> it to <T_7> number who <T_6> senior year .
after <T_1> of resends in relay , the <T_5> was found , and <T_4> witnessed <T_3> reunion of <T_0> family through <T_2> .
fact is , there &apos;s a <T_4> rule : if <T_3> don &apos;t <T_5> it , it &apos;s <T_2> ; <T_0> you do like <T_7> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_6> .
so , <T_1> was like <T_2> kid <T_0> a candy store .
the <T_1> does <T_0> use that .
<T_2> you fish <T_1> , you &apos;re <T_0> catching more .
but <T_2> for <T_1> good <T_0> !
crossing <T_0> and <T_2> of <T_3> -- <T_4> ice snowdrifts that <T_1> be hip-deep .
<T_1> is my <T_0> for <T_2> l.a. museum of <T_3> .
<T_2> the <T_0> would be over very <T_1> .
<T_3> happened very <T_5> , <T_1> that bodes well for the <T_0> of <T_4> elsewhere in the <T_2> .
and he <T_1> up the <T_0> and he threw <T_2> back in the bin <T_3>
<T_0> soon are you going <T_1> ? &quot;
<T_6> &apos;re worried <T_1> this <T_7> , <T_3> any <T_0> flu we &apos;ve ever <T_8> , can be transmitted <T_5> eating raw <T_4> of the <T_2> animals .
we <T_1> to be able to hold <T_0> manipulate that <T_2> in <T_3> to form <T_4> .
because <T_0> people <T_1> outside the u.k .
this <T_0> a <T_1> threat .
i &apos;m <T_0> in the kind of <T_1> that thinks <T_2> along these lines : that thinks , &quot; <T_3> can &apos;t believe <T_4> any <T_6> this <T_5> .
<T_1> this is <T_2> first <T_3> project <T_0> worked on .
so <T_5> we &apos;re doing now <T_7> we &apos;re taking <T_2> of the <T_4> that the computer cannot recognize <T_9> we &apos;re getting people to <T_6> them <T_1> us <T_3> they &apos;re typing <T_0> captcha on <T_8> internet .
but here &apos;s how the <T_0> will <T_1> .
<T_1> i would <T_4> , &quot; alex , i <T_2> that <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> difficult .
<T_1> : <T_2> . it &apos;s <T_0> smoke .
for <T_1> , <T_3> weak force <T_0> and <T_5> anti-particle <T_2> be created in a <T_4> .
<T_2> i <T_1> to <T_3> on a <T_0> of these .
<T_0> put <T_1> pressure where <T_3> pressure <T_2> to be put .
<T_2> can call <T_0> the face <T_3> of the <T_1> , right ?
he <T_2> buy things <T_0> king henry , in all <T_3> wealth , could <T_1> buy .
people are living <T_0> and societies <T_2> getting <T_1> .
and paul <T_4> argues that <T_0> west <T_3> of itself <T_2> probably the most <T_1> of all <T_5> .
this is <T_0> public <T_1> .
here &apos;s how <T_0> sample the <T_1> .
<T_4> a clash is <T_0> to take place , like <T_1> the <T_3> of the <T_2> .
you see the <T_2> laborers . you see <T_5> english engineer <T_6> directions in the background . <T_1> more <T_4> , the places <T_3> the <T_9> . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , <T_0> , <T_8> , <T_7> york .
pretty much <T_3> the <T_0> majority of <T_2> , no one gave a damn about <T_1> .
<T_1> percent reduction <T_5> violence -- in <T_4> everyone <T_2> was <T_3> impossible and <T_0> couldn &apos;t <T_6> .
<T_0> the pictures we <T_5> shown daily <T_4> the <T_6> , <T_2> between developed countries <T_1> no longer <T_3> .
one <T_5> see here <T_1> clearly , you can <T_6> we <T_0> 25 pale green <T_4> , of <T_2> one is in the form of a <T_3> .
now <T_6> , <T_1> you <T_5> get standing <T_2> and i say , &quot; <T_4> the hell <T_8> wrong with <T_0> ? why <T_7> we <T_3> sitting there ? &quot;
and <T_0> the <T_5> six months , a beautiful thing <T_8> ; the entrepreneurs <T_4> the <T_9> , they were paid , and their <T_7> , in fact , grew , <T_3> they <T_2> able to support <T_1> and <T_6> the trajectory of their lives .
<T_1> don &apos;t need the <T_0> at all .
and yet i think <T_6> &apos;s this <T_0> of us as <T_2> to look at <T_3> world through <T_4> lens <T_7> normal is one of <T_1> forces that stops us developing real <T_5> .
extreme sports <T_8> top <T_3> like <T_5> is <T_2> possible if you practice step <T_1> step , if <T_6> really work <T_7> on your skills <T_4> on your <T_0> .
<T_1> dare <T_0> be <T_2> ?
and i &apos;m not <T_1> , <T_4> everywhere <T_7> go , <T_6> &apos;m getting all <T_0> of advice : <T_2> here , move <T_3> , <T_8> out for <T_5> .
<T_2> things <T_0> showed as a <T_1> at the very <T_3> .
obviously <T_1> , we &apos;ve moved past palm <T_0> to <T_2> .
<T_0> again , these <T_1> rock it out .
<T_0> &apos;re <T_6> at the <T_4> . this is months and <T_3> and <T_2> of dreaming <T_7> get <T_5> , years of <T_1> and planning <T_8> preparation .
<T_7> , he got <T_4> age-old <T_6> of <T_2> it , which <T_5> relief , and he worked this <T_0> three-point <T_1> , which <T_8> brand-new technology at <T_3> time .
<T_3> in <T_2> own <T_4> , in fact , <T_0> in <T_1> mirror .
you <T_3> , <T_6> &apos;s an <T_1> line , <T_8> it <T_9> been shown to work -- &quot; why <T_4> &apos;t you <T_7> up to <T_0> cave , so i <T_5> show <T_2> my hand axes ? &quot;
<T_1> reading <T_0> just about <T_2> .
and one of the things that i <T_7> is <T_0> is that we have <T_5> get away from <T_4> idea of <T_1> the machines <T_6> , but actually <T_8> them evolve and <T_2> , like <T_3> , and perhaps that &apos;s <T_9> way we &apos;ll get there . thank you .
and <T_5> had all <T_0> of counting <T_6> ready there in <T_3> , followed <T_1> german , followed <T_4> spanish , followed by <T_2> .
human <T_3> is also <T_0> , <T_2> it just gets <T_1> cross .
and <T_1> need <T_0> save dinner .
<T_0> flash up into my <T_1> , <T_3> like <T_2> for pictures .
so you &apos;re more likely to <T_2> in a <T_3> state , <T_0> , <T_4> more <T_1> .
they &apos;re very ancient . it goes back as long as <T_0> is written <T_1> .
<T_0> united architects , <T_8> , we made a <T_5> for <T_4> european central <T_9> headquarters that <T_6> the same <T_2> , but <T_7> time in a much <T_3> monolithic mass , like <T_1> sphere .
but <T_0> challenge is <T_1> society &apos;s perception of possibility , and it &apos;s a huge challenge .
<T_0> means <T_2> intimacy and it means visual <T_1> .
that was like , <T_1> considered <T_0> super <T_2> .
look at <T_3> provinces <T_0> kenya . <T_2> are <T_1> different .
<T_0> in addition , there &apos;s something <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> the <T_2> group of all .
the <T_1> don &apos;t <T_2> leave <T_0> computer lab <T_3> 2 <T_4> 3 a.m .
here &apos;s a <T_0> little <T_1> .
i want <T_5> end by saying <T_6> &apos;s been the <T_9> of thousands of <T_2> human beings doing , i think , extraordinary <T_4> , that have actually improved <T_1> , <T_7> , maybe only <T_3> a <T_0> way , reduced <T_8> .
in <T_0> to predict <T_1> , we <T_3> to use <T_2> .
<T_4> first learned <T_2> my son had been <T_0> the world <T_5> center <T_6> the morning <T_1> september 11th , <T_3> .
and our <T_2> is to make <T_7> seating carriage very sculptural <T_1> out of wood <T_0> like <T_4> big <T_5> sitting <T_3> this plaster <T_6> .
now the way taskrabbit <T_2> is , people <T_0> the tasks that they want doing , name the <T_3> they &apos;re willing to pay , and <T_6> vetted <T_9> yes , there &apos;s actually <T_8> four-stage , rigorous <T_1> process that &apos;s designed to find the people that would make great <T_4> assistants <T_7> weed out the <T_5> rabbits .
and <T_2> the vaccine appeared last winter , there were <T_0> lot of people -- <T_6> surprising number -- who <T_9> to get it -- as <T_3> nice example of how <T_7> &apos;s <T_4> of security change , how their model <T_5> , sort of wildly with no new <T_8> , with no <T_1> input .
but <T_1> &apos;ve come a <T_0> way .
without <T_3> at your cell phone directly <T_0> , <T_1> you remember <T_5> icon <T_4> the <T_2> right corner ?
<T_2> are <T_3> ; they &apos;re <T_1> all <T_0> the place .
<T_6> generates all of <T_4> buoyancy , <T_3> of the <T_7> for <T_5> craft , and <T_1> batteries are down <T_8> hanging underneath , exactly <T_0> a <T_2> .
when <T_2> eat a big fatty <T_0> , how <T_1> you <T_3> ?
<T_2> chinese general <T_0> tzu said <T_3> all war was <T_1> on deception .
<T_2> we <T_0> victims of the <T_1> .
do <T_1> fear what has <T_0> up .
and i organize it . and , <T_0> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company <T_6> is a negotiation <T_9> one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s <T_7> world , the world of ideas , the world of <T_3> , of <T_2> , with the relationship of <T_8> exterior world <T_5> all the limitations , the naysayers .
<T_3> here <T_1> an <T_0> bracket for the <T_2> purpose .
and they &apos;re a <T_1> color because <T_2> &apos;re a different <T_0> .
actually i &apos;m <T_2> going to pause for one <T_8> , because i <T_6> that there &apos;s <T_9> prerequisite <T_0> speak here at <T_5> -- you had to have <T_7> picture of yourself <T_1> the <T_3> days with <T_4> hair .

that <T_0> the <T_1> would be very , very high .
<T_2> , what &apos;s the <T_0> of this <T_1> ?
<T_2> &apos;s the <T_1> of <T_3> using <T_4> escalator , and it &apos;s in three <T_0> .

and <T_3> never needed <T_0> to <T_2> -- <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s a <T_1> for <T_0> disobedience .
i like to say my <T_1> biomaterial <T_0> my four year-old .

i <T_4> worried <T_2> my trust experiments <T_1> small amounts of <T_5> didn &apos;t really <T_6> how <T_3> we <T_7> trust our <T_0> to strangers .
<T_8> &apos;ve run several dozen such surveys in <T_2> parts of the world , and in all cases <T_1> one , where a <T_5> actually <T_3> the trade-to-gdp ratio , <T_4> have this tendency towards <T_0> , and so <T_6> thought it important to give a <T_9> to this , and that &apos;s what i refer to as globaloney , the difference between the dark <T_7> bars and the light gray bars .
so really what i &apos;m doing is using <T_0> fantastic little <T_1> .
<T_2> go <T_4> for <T_1> in <T_0> and all those other <T_3> .
<T_1> is <T_0> a large <T_2> brain .
<T_8> , with <T_0> in <T_5> , first of all <T_6> me <T_9> you , i &apos;m <T_4> of <T_3> children . i &apos;m <T_7> oldest , the <T_1> four are <T_2> .
<T_2> love <T_0> out <T_1> three year-olds .
and so you know <T_2> you <T_3> saw <T_0> picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much <T_1> you .
<T_1> should we be <T_0> ? <T_3> &apos;s the <T_2> ?
and <T_2> &apos;s <T_3> i look for <T_1> my <T_4> , a <T_0> meaning .
<T_0> sister <T_1> struggling <T_2> get through undergrad .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> the developmental <T_3> of entrepreneurship , <T_0> ethical <T_1> of democracy .
but <T_1> i sign <T_2> a shaking <T_5> , posterity <T_8> say , &apos; <T_4> hesitated . &apos; &quot; <T_3> he waited <T_6> he could take up the <T_7> and sign <T_0> a bold and <T_9> hand .
and we <T_3> working on it , <T_0> we figured <T_2> we <T_6> tell the <T_4> of <T_7> ancient <T_5> from analyzing <T_1> coral like this .
<T_0> so <T_1> start <T_2> designs <T_3> that question .
<T_2> your <T_1> goes smaller <T_0> clearer .
<T_3> went <T_1> notre dame university <T_5> graduated with <T_2> in accounting <T_4> german , <T_6> spending <T_0> year of study in austria .
<T_6> there a risk that <T_0> go to places like africa <T_2> say , we &apos;ve got to fix this problem and we can do it , <T_9> &apos;ve got <T_7> these <T_3> of dollars , you know , da , da , da -- here &apos;s <T_8> big idea . and <T_1> of take a much more complex situation <T_5> actually end up making a mess of it . <T_4> you worry about that ?
<T_4> is <T_6> einstein , <T_3> bohr , <T_1> fermat &apos;s last theorem , and <T_5> &apos;m <T_7> sure whether <T_2> &apos;s james <T_8> or <T_0> harris .
thank you .
<T_2> you come <T_1> , and you discover <T_0> 80 <T_6> of all the <T_5> in <T_3> and in europe have dropped their <T_4> .
i really thought <T_0> were so <T_1> me .
think about it . if <T_6> were an <T_5> and <T_1> told <T_0> that <T_3> had to <T_8> an automobile , but <T_7> had to start off to be <T_4> big , <T_2> it had to grow to be full <T_9> and had to work every step along the way .

so , <T_2> pushed the <T_3> down <T_5> the <T_0> , <T_1> we create an initial <T_4> surface .

that &apos;s what i do in <T_2> -- telling <T_3> , <T_8> novels -- <T_9> today i would like <T_5> tell you <T_4> few <T_6> about the <T_0> of <T_1> and also some supernatural creatures called <T_7> djinni .
<T_2> &apos;ve met <T_0> , <T_5> millions of people , <T_1> want the opportunity to <T_3> in <T_4> change .

so you can see <T_1> in <T_4> lower level of <T_0> library <T_2> books and the <T_3> .
<T_4> you look at <T_7> solar system , as <T_6> know it <T_3> , it has <T_5> few <T_8> close to <T_1> sun . <T_0> &apos;s where <T_2> live .
so <T_5> judgments <T_2> the case when everything <T_1> fine remain the <T_3> . they say she <T_4> no <T_0> .
<T_2> where <T_0> came from ? <T_1> .
now <T_0> can get it <T_2> about 100 <T_1> .
<T_1> , we &apos;re <T_0> longing for <T_2> to return .
so the point <T_1> , this <T_2> really interesting <T_0> .
<T_3> of course , everybody got it . everybody <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> , of <T_1> , <T_4> &apos;re <T_5> right .

so <T_4> understand this , let &apos;s look <T_0> one of <T_6> classes , the machine <T_3> class offered by my <T_1> and <T_2> andrew <T_5> .
we <T_1> invite partners who can support <T_3> , but <T_0> have <T_2> start .
<T_2> , <T_3> -- for a <T_0> time , <T_1> was not a <T_4> .
the <T_4> was to have -- the <T_3> principal , <T_2> divided <T_5> -- take <T_0> from <T_6> sides <T_1> let them do something together .
and <T_0> will <T_3> in <T_1> that we cannot <T_2> .
so , we <T_0> up . what <T_1> ?
so <T_3> &apos;re <T_0> in <T_2> uniquely <T_1> place .

<T_4> that first <T_2> , their <T_3> for <T_1> injury is <T_0> greater .
<T_5> to <T_4> here and to talk <T_2> you <T_6> a <T_0> dear to <T_3> heart , which is <T_1> .
and in <T_6> to <T_1> interaction , we <T_0> to <T_5> bring people in <T_3> make them realize how <T_2> is <T_4> of their <T_7> .

there &apos;s just <T_2> little <T_0> of it <T_1> .
all <T_1> . well , <T_0> you so much <T_2> your <T_4> . <T_3> you .
<T_1> it <T_7> takes <T_3> do well , <T_2> lead a meaningful <T_5> , <T_8> things that <T_6> deeper , <T_0> we don &apos;t really <T_4> have words for .
i was born <T_1> calcutta -- a <T_4> where <T_2> father and <T_7> father <T_8> him <T_6> journalists , <T_0> they <T_5> magazines in the <T_3> language .

indeed , the very famous <T_3> thomas <T_9> once said , &quot; to truly <T_2> an <T_8> life form <T_6> this <T_7> , you <T_1> lock yourself inside <T_5> room with <T_4> flying , echolocating <T_0> in complete darkness . &quot;
that <T_1> us to the <T_3> point i want you think about : <T_2> ethical <T_0> of <T_4> .
<T_3> that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found <T_2> practice , and <T_1> &apos;s what <T_0> history <T_4> journalism is .
and that makes <T_3> now the <T_2> funder <T_0> prostate cancer research <T_5> support programs <T_1> the <T_4> .

<T_0> she <T_7> them so <T_4> could either be broken <T_3> into <T_1> , or they could be <T_6> these , which <T_2> leaves that can be <T_5> .
<T_6> group <T_2> students <T_5> told that a small <T_4> country had <T_0> invaded and had asked <T_1> u.s. for <T_3> .

well a <T_5> of things : <T_6> of the <T_3> , of <T_0> risks , <T_1> threats , the <T_4> , how <T_2> work .
ok , <T_2> me <T_0> more <T_3> . <T_1> .
if there &apos;s time at <T_1> end , i &apos;ll <T_3> you the <T_0> more dramatic <T_2> .
<T_0> would that mean ? <T_2> have <T_1> idea .
it gives us a <T_2> bit of justin <T_0> and <T_3> little bit of <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved <T_0> a species .
so i &apos;m looking <T_8> to seeing some <T_7> , and actually louis castle , that &apos;s him <T_0> there , last week <T_4> that electronic <T_1> , one of the <T_6> game publishers , is releasing <T_5> game in may that has a little easter <T_2> feature for supporting this type <T_9> head <T_3> .

so <T_1> this <T_0> .
and <T_3> is <T_0> good <T_2> . we need lots of <T_1> .
and road <T_6> is <T_1> we &apos;re all going to have <T_4> go , because <T_2> we pay for <T_3> maintenance <T_0> wear <T_5> tear on our cars <T_7> gas taxes .
and so many low-income people <T_9> seen so <T_7> failed <T_0> broken and seen <T_2> many <T_5> and <T_6> medicines <T_8> to them that building <T_3> takes a lot of <T_1> , takes <T_4> lot of patience .
<T_0> we <T_4> about <T_3> world <T_1> as <T_5> this panel , and i <T_2> very optimistic .
<T_0> , <T_1> see , if <T_5> 1950 , being completely competent , that <T_4> have <T_2> you a <T_3> career .
so first of all , <T_4> you , and <T_5> would <T_0> to acknowledge that four <T_9> who could talk <T_1> us for <T_6> days actually managed to stay <T_8> four minutes each , <T_3> we thank <T_7> for <T_2> .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> to <T_1> with that definition .
and i <T_8> to be bothered by <T_3> , <T_7> then i got to thinking , well , <T_0> a minute . i bought <T_6> first apple computer in <T_1> and i bought <T_9> because i could <T_5> , &quot; i got a computer at my <T_4> and <T_2> don &apos;t .
<T_3> than <T_0> percent , <T_2> percent , <T_5> the living space <T_4> our <T_1> is ocean .
<T_2> : and <T_0> up <T_1> intensity ; <T_4> &apos;re still pink in the <T_3> .
<T_2> do <T_0> rules give rise <T_1> the patterns ?
well , <T_2> thing <T_1> do , we get <T_0> working .
<T_1> you look <T_0> our <T_4> services , including search firms , including <T_2> , including <T_9> services , including banking , they &apos;re <T_8> pro <T_3> . <T_5> it &apos;s <T_7> to save <T_6> .
and <T_1> it &apos;s a <T_0> interesting <T_3> that &apos;s going across the <T_2> .
can <T_0> use them ?
so <T_1> like to show <T_2> photograph of a <T_0> game to <T_4> two aspects <T_3> how <T_6> social <T_5> work .
<T_0> at my <T_4> was <T_2> great , still blue plate of <T_1> pacific <T_3> .
if we try to focus <T_3> the <T_8> , <T_6> what we need <T_5> focus on is what &apos;s <T_7> happening goldman <T_4> has <T_2> that <T_9> , the <T_0> economy , will surpass that of <T_1> u.s .
every year <T_2> the <T_3> , over 20,000 are killed <T_1> injured <T_4> 350,000 home <T_0> .
seventy-five percent of <T_7> national <T_5> in <T_2> , over <T_1> at the minute , <T_6> actually local , indigenous <T_4> from <T_3> communities we <T_0> in .
<T_5> diplomat ended <T_1> advising three successive <T_0> prime <T_4> and the multi-party negotiation <T_3> of <T_2> .
and <T_0> journey lasted <T_1> weeks , 72 <T_2> .
<T_3> this graph from ken <T_6> . it &apos;s <T_5> to say came , because <T_2> -- at a <T_0> that i believe marty hoffart was <T_1> at in the mid- &apos; 90s -- <T_8> and i <T_4> up at the back of <T_7> meeting <T_9> said , &quot; geo-engineering won &apos;t work . &quot;
<T_3> in this sense , you <T_0> can look into the <T_6> , <T_2> , but <T_4> can look <T_1> the <T_5> .
<T_4> is some <T_1> that the <T_0> gave <T_2> , and <T_6> get <T_5> out of the drinking wells in <T_3> south pole .
<T_0> then the <T_1> come .
<T_0> now what ?
back in 1980 when <T_4> richard pryor <T_6> set himself <T_8> fire <T_1> a <T_0> accident , <T_2> was in <T_3> angeles the <T_7> after it happened and then i was in <T_5> d.c. two <T_9> after that .
the <T_0> consequences <T_1> almost <T_2> .
why <T_0> we waste <T_2> money on <T_1> ? &quot;
believe <T_2> , <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> whole lot <T_0> ways <T_1> make money .
the second , or a <T_3> kind of <T_4> is that <T_5> the large metropolitan areas <T_2> over the world , you have pockets , like slums , or <T_0> , or <T_6> areas , which are <T_8> and economically <T_1> from the rest of the <T_9> , so it &apos;s <T_7> and them .
and <T_0> , this is <T_6> to <T_4> in two million fewer <T_7> dying every <T_5> , last <T_1> , <T_3> in the <T_2> 2000 .
165 .
<T_1> it is through <T_0> structure that mutual <T_2> will occur .
the one after that , i <T_2> on top of <T_0> hundred <T_1> pillar for <T_3> hours .
how is it <T_3> we can actually take <T_0> type <T_2> activity <T_1> ?
<T_0> &apos;re <T_2> there for <T_1> .
but even <T_4> a cheaper <T_6> can actually have <T_1> charming <T_7> , <T_0> breathe a <T_2> extra life <T_5> a <T_3> trend .
<T_0> i <T_1> , so <T_2> the <T_3> .
electrification , central <T_3> , <T_2> of <T_5> cars , they all went <T_0> zero <T_1> 100 <T_4> .
and <T_2> &apos;s produced a great <T_0> , <T_1> shallow <T_3> of human <T_4> .
and i <T_0> to that address <T_1> knocked <T_2> the <T_4> , and a man <T_3> the door .
and <T_0> speed with <T_4> they associate it with &quot; <T_5> millionaire &quot; or <T_3> favelas in <T_2> speaks <T_6> the <T_1> nature .
<T_4> -- which <T_2> think is the appropriate <T_1> effect <T_0> that <T_3> money : 11,900 <T_5> .
<T_4> a <T_8> sees his <T_0> blown up , <T_7> brain goes into such high <T_1> that <T_9> can &apos;t actually put the <T_5> into <T_2> , so he just <T_3> the <T_6> over and over again .
is <T_3> because <T_5> had the <T_0> that i have <T_7> a <T_4> coincidence <T_6> writing <T_1> these <T_2> ?
<T_1> very <T_0> .
<T_2> chavez <T_0> not invent the <T_5> middle and <T_3> class of venezuela . <T_4> merely <T_1> them .
they <T_0> on top of one another in the standard charge <T_1> .
<T_2> do <T_1> need ? <T_3> need a <T_0> of circles .
this <T_1> , of course , <T_3> works with <T_0> wild <T_2> .
so <T_2> quit <T_3> company <T_1> started <T_4> career as a <T_0> performer .
<T_0> those <T_3> the same <T_1> who are going <T_2> be getting <T_4> .
they <T_3> thrown the <T_1> shutter in <T_0> garbage <T_2> place .
<T_1> &apos;s usually <T_2> flat on <T_0> lap .
<T_3> is <T_2> keene . <T_1> &apos;s just a <T_0> guy .
<T_3> the first theory <T_2> : it <T_0> be the <T_1> .
<T_0> seems that our <T_4> find the <T_3> way to <T_1> of garbage <T_2> in water sources .
<T_3> is the <T_4> -- <T_0> is the <T_2> famous <T_1> of all of these .
<T_0> don &apos;t own a <T_1> .
it &apos;s a global <T_1> . <T_2> have to get this <T_0> .
<T_0> : <T_4> played &quot; <T_2> &quot; <T_6> this . ao : just <T_3> , <T_5> ? here we <T_1> .
so , <T_2> must <T_0> aware that <T_1> society has <T_3> shape up itself .
<T_0> you . <T_2> you . <T_1> you .
and that &apos;s <T_9> these are for , in <T_4> you &apos;ve been <T_3> , because most <T_1> assume that meditation <T_8> all about stopping thoughts , getting rid of <T_2> , <T_5> controlling the <T_0> , <T_6> actually it &apos;s quite <T_7> from that .
in <T_0> shredder condition , <T_4> twice as <T_2> -- 30 <T_3> per <T_1> .
<T_5> come <T_2> us <T_4> start <T_3> , &quot; <T_1> are you doing <T_0> ? &quot;
left home .
<T_3> &apos;ve created entire value <T_5> and <T_2> physical <T_4> to support <T_1> worth <T_0> self .
<T_2> drown at twice <T_0> rate of <T_1> , <T_3> men <T_4> they can swim across that <T_5> .
<T_2> , there &apos;s <T_4> level <T_8> fine-grained conceptual <T_5> , <T_6> we automatically and <T_1> compute every <T_9> we <T_7> or <T_3> a sentence , that governs <T_0> use of language .
we &apos;re going to <T_0> apply one of those <T_1> to it , and we <T_2> it .
i <T_0> to share some of that story with <T_1> , <T_5> also <T_8> of my <T_7> around <T_4> and <T_6> role <T_3> social <T_2> in <T_9> change in muslim-majority societies .
<T_0> other set of <T_5> for <T_3> in the treatment <T_1> the elderly <T_2> the society &apos;s cultural <T_4> .
we <T_1> a lot <T_7> what &apos;s going on with design around the <T_3> , <T_4> it &apos;s getting <T_2> more difficult to find <T_6> that reflects <T_0> unique <T_5> .
the office building is basically obsolete for doing <T_0> work .
<T_5> is <T_4> merry-go-round <T_2> by the <T_1> , which pumps <T_3> as <T_0> play . you know ?
<T_2> reason <T_0> went on <T_3> was <T_1> .
more <T_0> more , <T_3> &apos;s possible for <T_2> hatred <T_6> to manifest itself in the <T_4> of organized <T_1> on <T_5> soil .
<T_1> would <T_0> to show you six <T_2> .
these <T_2> were actually out <T_3> the land and they were <T_4> climbing <T_5> and <T_1> on prey <T_6> the <T_0> .
i then kind of thought about the <T_5> cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design , like basel , where vitra is located , or in northern italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of <T_1> , and where pedestrian <T_0> -- and <T_2> came to the conclusion that <T_3> there was something about these <T_4> design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic , and i &apos;m sure the skeptic eye would say , <T_7> , the correlation there is that there are universities and <T_6> where people can &apos;t afford cars , but it did seem that in <T_8> of these areas pedestrian traffic was <T_9> .
<T_5> together <T_1> this new type <T_4> interfaces , we can <T_7> these <T_0> and apply <T_2> to safer <T_3> for <T_6> people .
my dysfunctional <T_1> could <T_5> plug in <T_4> another <T_2> , <T_6> my own , <T_0> it <T_7> so <T_3> .
<T_7> they put that <T_1> kind <T_3> tension into <T_0> sculpting of <T_6> car that <T_8> do in <T_4> great <T_5> that <T_9> would go and look at <T_2> a museum .
<T_2> said spades ? <T_0> : <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;t think , &quot; <T_4> , we created <T_0> internet for <T_1> own <T_2> . &quot;
and <T_0> came up and said , &quot; <T_2> have the <T_1> , mr. <T_5> ; i will <T_3> you the <T_4> . &quot;
being a <T_4> , after <T_5> died , <T_3> wrote <T_1> book , &quot; <T_0> cost of <T_2> . &quot;
<T_9> here &apos;s an interesting <T_0> : starting from zero in 1900 , only 30 years <T_7> , <T_3> ratio <T_8> motor vehicles to the <T_6> of households <T_1> the <T_2> reached 90 <T_5> in just <T_4> years .
the <T_9> researcher <T_6> this trait , robert mccrae <T_4> that , &quot; <T_3> individuals have an affinity for liberal , <T_1> , left-wing political <T_5> &quot; -- <T_0> like a <T_7> which is open and changing -- &quot; whereas <T_8> individuals prefer <T_2> , traditional , right-wing views . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> that <T_0> means .
hello !
<T_3> there &apos;s <T_0> / <T_2> . and then <T_1> are <T_4> from war .
this , of course , is a <T_0> map that i &apos;m showing you , but this <T_1> to any <T_3> of map -- auditory , for example , in <T_7> to sound <T_9> , <T_8> to <T_6> maps that we <T_2> with <T_5> skin in relation to an object <T_4> we palpate .
<T_1> for <T_0> , they will flourish .
and , of course , one <T_2> the <T_4> to be wanting <T_0> give away <T_3> you have as a <T_1> .
<T_8> , <T_5> keeping with today &apos;s theme , <T_7> &apos;d like to point out -- and something you <T_0> know -- that <T_6> a <T_1> advantage someplace <T_3> life can yield <T_2> results <T_4> else .
<T_5> had to <T_2> every <T_6> case of smallpox in the world at the <T_1> time <T_4> draw a <T_0> of <T_3> around it .
yes <T_1> can . we <T_0> do it .
this was -- out of all the <T_1> in <T_0> york city <T_4> this was her <T_3> pick <T_2>
<T_7> the a-bomb , <T_4> said <T_0> would take 75 <T_2> for <T_3> radiation-damaged <T_5> of hiroshima city to <T_1> grow <T_6> again .
<T_1> this is <T_0> your audience <T_2> a moron .
<T_4> &apos;s a quote <T_0> t. s. <T_3> , a little <T_1> than 50 <T_2> ago .
<T_3> would seem <T_1> the object <T_4> desire <T_2> comes into its own <T_5> disappearing <T_0> .
it &apos;s not an <T_0> , <T_5> in <T_2> english <T_4> , it is <T_1> an <T_3> .
nobel peace laureate jody williams brings tough <T_6> to the <T_8> of world <T_0> , <T_7> her razor-sharp <T_9> on <T_4> &quot; peace &quot; really <T_3> , and a <T_2> of profound stories that zero in <T_5> the creative <T_1> -- and sacrifice -- of those who work for it .
and <T_8> &apos;m going to focus <T_0> afghanistan <T_9> the <T_6> world with the <T_4> , how they &apos;re changing tribal societies , not by <T_5> western <T_7> , <T_1> by being <T_3> into the language in <T_2> places .
so <T_8> oceans don &apos;t always <T_1> together ; <T_9> act <T_0> , but <T_4> is <T_3> kind of <T_2> that <T_5> have to live with , and <T_6> &apos;s <T_7> easy .
<T_1> use two and a half times the <T_0> of energy as <T_2> .
so <T_1> these <T_0> more and more frequently on the <T_4> , people cry for <T_2> government to <T_3> actions to stop <T_5> .
it has <T_0> own <T_1> .
and <T_2> solution <T_4> terms of the balconies <T_0> to use something <T_5> we <T_1> know as a scoreboard <T_3> .
we can beat <T_0> poverty , <T_2> , <T_1> .
as <T_0> former vice <T_2> said , we <T_1> to become activists .
yang <T_0> : <T_1> generation that &apos;s remaking <T_2>
<T_0> don &apos;t know <T_1> they do <T_2> yet .
if <T_0> does it <T_2> tomorrow , i &apos;m going to throw <T_4> off <T_5> building <T_3> kill <T_1> . &quot;
people <T_3> that . people <T_0> of trade <T_1> a modern <T_2> .
so <T_0> have to make a <T_1> cartooning .
so <T_2> 1945 -- actually , the bomb hasn &apos;t even been dropped yet -- and <T_0> neumann is <T_4> together all the <T_9> to actually build this <T_3> , which also goes back <T_5> turing , who , before that , gave the idea <T_7> you could do <T_8> this with <T_1> very brainless , little , finite <T_6> machine , just reading a tape in and reading a tape out .
the <T_5> bill is largely ignoring the <T_9> <T_0> the age wave that &apos;s coming , <T_1> the implications <T_7> what we need to do to <T_3> not only how we pay <T_6> care , but deliver <T_8> <T_4> some radically different <T_2> .
<T_1> that is <T_0> mental quality <T_2> equanimity .
<T_4> is <T_1> of the seven <T_3> sputniks that <T_0> not launched <T_2> space .

so <T_6> insight <T_1> how do you <T_4> reverse engineer <T_5> and go <T_7> cocoon <T_0> gland and get <T_2> and <T_8> that is your <T_3> material .
but <T_1> is <T_2> fun <T_0> children .
where is <T_0> ? <T_1> &apos;s no <T_2> ...
<T_2> you want <T_3> choose <T_0> punch <T_4> punch card clock , you <T_1> age me .
<T_2> have met these <T_1> everywhere on the <T_0> .
the core comes <T_0> as these cylindrical <T_1> of limestone .
<T_8> one thing : it &apos;s important <T_3> for only your <T_0> city ; every <T_2> , <T_1> its <T_7> problems , they have a very <T_5> role in <T_6> with <T_4> humanity .
but <T_3> are <T_2> feeling <T_1> pain of the <T_0> .
it &apos;s called <T_0> des <T_1> -- <T_2> .

<T_0> i appreciated the <T_1> , i &apos;ll tell you that .
<T_0> was much <T_2> wished to say <T_1> abed .
so all of <T_0> places <T_2> these <T_1> .
<T_1> we need <T_2> new <T_0> .
<T_1> of people <T_3> full <T_4> part-time jobs , <T_0> live in their <T_2> .
<T_3> kate orff sees <T_1> oyster as an agent of <T_7> change . bundled into beds <T_2> sunk into city rivers , oysters slurp <T_9> pollution and make legendarily dirty waters clean -- thus driving even more <T_6> in &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot; orff <T_0> her vision for an urban landscape <T_5> links nature and <T_4> for mutual <T_8> .
now just this past year , one of <T_0> partners , <T_2> american <T_5> of surgeons , teamed <T_8> with us to <T_1> an <T_3> that <T_9> surgeons should <T_7> fls -certified <T_4> they do minimally invasive <T_6> .
and <T_6> we found was , as we <T_4> in <T_0> research , <T_2> , <T_1> we were asking <T_5> the <T_3> question .
you see , we also learn that experts are <T_6> , are governed , by the <T_4> and cultural <T_9> of their times -- <T_2> it be <T_8> doctors in victorian england , say , <T_7> sent women <T_3> asylums for expressing sexual desire , or the psychiatrists <T_1> the united states who , up until <T_0> , were still <T_5> homosexuality as a mental illness .
<T_2> if you cure <T_3> , i <T_4> get <T_1> wall <T_0> . &quot;
now <T_6> have <T_2> way of actually testing to see whether <T_0> dinosaur , <T_4> any <T_5> , is a <T_1> one or an <T_3> one .
<T_0> these are kind of <T_1> .

and <T_0> from the power of an <T_1> down .

<T_1> only prepared <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;ve got a choice <T_1> us .
<T_2> : <T_1> might be a <T_0> warm .
<T_3> there &apos;s also <T_1> lot of <T_4> that <T_2> don &apos;t <T_0> .
so eventually <T_0> went on is <T_3> decided that , well <T_2> need to learn to <T_1> .
<T_1> are <T_2> embedded in <T_0> networks ?
<T_4> 33 are spread <T_0> europe , <T_2> middle <T_3> and <T_1> .
but <T_0> goes <T_1> .
so , <T_1> challenge is <T_2> speed <T_0> .
so that &apos;s why <T_6> &apos;ve <T_1> been fascinated with <T_0> technology could actually <T_4> and <T_5> up <T_2> societies like <T_3> .
and their <T_0> visions , <T_2> their engagement with <T_3> mathematical <T_1> .

but <T_1> , i blame <T_0> queen <T_2> dictionaries have really <T_3> changed .
twenty-three percent said , &quot; as <T_1> as it &apos;s proven <T_0> . &quot;
i <T_1> , i <T_0> useless .
now the <T_1> thing that will piss you off , <T_2> , is <T_0> all of us are , in fact , going to die <T_4> the 21st <T_3> .
and when i complained to my <T_1> , a <T_7> war <T_6> who worked in film for 50 <T_9> <T_2> who supported me from the age of 13 , that <T_5> was terrified that if <T_8> turned down a plum assignment at <T_4> for a fellowship overseas , i would never ever , ever find another job , she said , &quot; <T_0> , i &apos;m going to tell <T_3> two things .

i was <T_0> hospital scrubs .
we &apos;re an <T_6> before <T_4> espys , and <T_7> thought <T_0> &apos;d gotten <T_2> two-inch <T_3> but <T_8> &apos;d actually bought <T_5> three-inch <T_1> .
that &apos;s <T_1> i &apos;m not running after this <T_0> money .
and so <T_0> can start reading on <T_3> ipad <T_2> your living room <T_4> then pick up where <T_6> left off <T_5> the <T_1> .
so <T_5> is <T_3> first sort of <T_8> into using <T_9> insight into <T_7> makes us human <T_4> , turning it into a <T_2> , and trying to gain <T_0> insights <T_6> mental <T_1> .
<T_5> , if <T_0> are talented , if <T_9> have the vocation and the <T_3> to <T_6> here , <T_8> get in . <T_1> share <T_2> us <T_4> make <T_7> .
<T_1> the <T_5> of <T_2> lumpur <T_0> that , if <T_4> developer would <T_6> something <T_7> gave <T_3> back to the city , they would give <T_9> more gross floor area , <T_8> .
there are <T_1> people that <T_2> that there &apos;s a high <T_3> there &apos;s a <T_0> .
<T_8> innovation is less <T_5> , <T_7> less <T_0> , wonderful <T_1> , then <T_6> is <T_3> to be even lower <T_4> half <T_2> history .
and what &apos;s interesting is that you <T_3> see that <T_1> is having a bit of a wobble , and <T_2> &apos;s all about heterarchical <T_4> , <T_7> people trust <T_5> like themselves more <T_0> they trust corporations and <T_6> .
<T_0> we &apos;re all <T_1> trying to , i <T_2> we &apos;re <T_7> trying to become <T_6> , <T_5> that &apos;s a <T_4> form of <T_3> .
<T_0> so then tarja was sitting <T_1> the <T_2> from me .
now <T_2> the <T_1> of the <T_0> .
<T_4> &apos;s the <T_1> that i think <T_9> -- which is a bit of a <T_7> , <T_5> that is about making <T_3> propositions -- <T_6> i <T_0> that &apos;s the <T_8> that sculpture can connect us <T_2> .
<T_0> this is the sort of thing that we <T_1> to deal <T_3> : there <T_2> glue <T_4> the spine of the book .
charles <T_0> ray <T_4> a team . <T_1> were <T_3> and <T_2> .
<T_2> hope when you learn <T_9> , like about <T_3> the natural world <T_6> -- <T_8> just want to say that whenever you <T_4> something <T_1> the newspaper or you get to hear some <T_7> about something <T_5> in the natural world it was done by <T_0> child .
i <T_3> watch the process done <T_1> first <T_2> before i <T_0> it .
<T_3> if <T_1> was to put money on it , i <T_4> put money on -- <T_6> a <T_8> unscientific <T_2> -- that <T_0> these things would also <T_5> up at the <T_7> .
<T_0> some of your <T_1> in that , too . &quot;
<T_4> i <T_7> to you that <T_1> sequence of <T_5> that <T_0> on rotting <T_3> are essential for the <T_2> of the <T_6> .
cricketers <T_1> over the world <T_4> , &quot; you know , we <T_3> india . <T_5> love <T_0> play <T_2> india . &quot;
and <T_1> to the <T_0> here .
so all of <T_6> cabling <T_3> all of the heavy <T_7> -- i &apos;m going <T_5> now to , sort of , the <T_2> part <T_9> the web <T_4> 1994 , when <T_1> growing 2,300 percent <T_8> <T_0> .
<T_2> them , of <T_0> , it can &apos;t <T_3> by marduk that made <T_1> this <T_4> .
i realized there were a <T_2> of people who <T_4> &apos;t <T_3> gay <T_0> i <T_6> -- <T_8> being <T_7> , <T_1> gay being <T_5> to the same <T_9> .
it &apos;s a <T_0> map of <T_1> .
so let &apos;s <T_2> if evan <T_1> actually <T_3> and <T_0> pulling .
but i -- i also <T_0> the <T_2> that <T_1> have here .
<T_0> made a new recording of him <T_2> in the shrine auditorium in <T_1> .
<T_6> want <T_7> thank you , thank you <T_1> you , thank you thank you , thank you <T_9> you , <T_4> you i <T_2> to <T_3> you , <T_0> you it <T_5> better , <T_8> ?
at <T_0> they &apos;re a little <T_1> out .
<T_4> to be <T_1> honest <T_0> you , i <T_3> of <T_2> television .
<T_2> guess <T_1> ? <T_0> didn &apos;t .
<T_0> &apos;ve got the organized <T_1> over here .
the <T_0> thing to <T_2> is <T_3> play is <T_1> anarchy .
but <T_3> &apos;ve got to <T_8> that <T_2> world <T_4> changed <T_6> , <T_1> the problems that we have <T_5> be solved by <T_7> nation and one nation <T_0> .
<T_1> 23 <T_2> years <T_3> , they appear in the fossil <T_0> .
what <T_0> do first is , i make a <T_5> of little musical ideas -- <T_6> can just improvise here at the <T_3> -- and <T_9> choose <T_7> of <T_4> to become my main theme , <T_8> main melody , like <T_1> abegg that <T_2> just heard .
<T_2> &apos;s still <T_0> in your <T_1> . &quot;
<T_4> his <T_3> i have had three police cases <T_2> against <T_0> alleging trespass , <T_1> and <T_5> .
<T_1> they <T_2> it in a wonderful <T_0> .
i <T_2> a little <T_1> to <T_4> it <T_3> little <T_0> .
so we <T_4> the tactics which <T_5> to the <T_0> , <T_2> this thing <T_3> call the small <T_1> of dispersion .
<T_2> you &apos;re seeing is <T_0> frequency of &quot; <T_1> &quot; and &quot; throve &quot; <T_4> time <T_3>
<T_2> otto was <T_1> to use foam bubble diagrams <T_3> foam bubble models to <T_0> his mannheim concert <T_4> .
<T_2> , you <T_1> know . some of them -- <T_3> &apos;ve got people in <T_0> countries out there <T_4> .
<T_7> &apos;ll <T_6> them both drop <T_2> of the middle <T_3> , <T_0> see <T_1> happens to women <T_4> see what happens to <T_5> .
<T_1> , <T_3> of all , i blame <T_0> queen because <T_2> &apos;s funny .
&quot; i <T_0> &apos;t know , <T_1> .
but anyway , not <T_3> does this <T_2> take on special <T_4> , you <T_0> your <T_1> on <T_5> .
and he told me , as it all was flooding back <T_0> memories .
<T_1> language dies every <T_0> days .
and <T_3> , a <T_2> a people aren &apos;t <T_1> to this , but <T_0> doodle <T_4> a <T_7> to <T_6> of our greatest <T_5> assets .
<T_9> i <T_2> only <T_4> you that <T_7> a scientist , i grew up <T_6> southern brazil in <T_3> mid- &apos; 60s watching a <T_8> crazy guys <T_0> &#91; us &#93; that <T_5> would go to the <T_1> .
and <T_7> defenders began to take cases <T_1> and <T_4> again <T_3> you will <T_0> , they have step <T_5> step began to <T_8> the <T_2> of <T_9> in <T_6> .
but the thing that really makes the <T_0> seem like <T_1> &apos;s is <T_2> franchisees .
<T_1> &apos;ve designed <T_3> for <T_2> , <T_0> things .
it &apos;s very <T_1> for <T_3> to <T_6> to yementimes.com , and <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> important to <T_0> to <T_2> voice .
they <T_1> it the <T_0> office .
of course we <T_0> .
we also <T_0> makos <T_2> our noaa <T_3> , blue <T_1> .
<T_1> many people here <T_0> over the age of <T_2> ?
the second <T_0> was <T_1> .
that <T_1> &apos;t the whole <T_4> . <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> of the <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;re going to <T_1> kind of blooming of the <T_0> in <T_3> middle .
<T_1> is your <T_0> , you <T_2> here . &quot;
<T_1> you . <T_0> you . <T_2> you .
when <T_4> look at the <T_0> york times , you look at other <T_6> , what you largely <T_7> are <T_5> of <T_3> wealthy nations and <T_2> nations we &apos;ve <T_1> .
<T_4> wants to be <T_3> out loud , <T_1> sound its <T_5> in <T_2> ear and on <T_0> tongue .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
this <T_2> &apos;s going <T_6> go to the right-hand <T_3> and poke <T_1> nose there , <T_7> he gets a <T_4> light every time <T_5> does <T_0> .
<T_3> can <T_1> have <T_0> lights back on <T_4> ? <T_2> you .
<T_5> depending <T_1> who <T_3> ask , the <T_4> was supposed to push <T_2> up even <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_4> keynote <T_0> 84k , and the <T_3> stands <T_1> it had 84 kilobytes of memory .
i <T_0> a lot of <T_1> .
he <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> , <T_1> ! <T_2> ! &quot;
these <T_1> have <T_0> on from <T_3> for just some <T_2> providing excellence for all <T_4> a very important <T_5> .
it &apos;s <T_2> than enough <T_0> for <T_1> .
<T_1> are <T_0> doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons ?
it &apos;s a <T_1> smart , smart <T_0> .
<T_0> of all , it &apos;s going <T_2> be built up , <T_3> &apos;re going <T_4> build the stuff out of <T_1> .
and <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> just <T_1> transportation , <T_5> love , <T_6> of course in <T_0> realms . <T_2> &apos;s fiverr.com .
<T_5> i got <T_7> to her , <T_8> after <T_0> while , she said <T_3> me , &quot; <T_2> know , we <T_1> thought <T_4> &apos;d be <T_6> . &quot;
you know , the <T_3> of human origins <T_2> kind of in <T_1> dna , <T_4> we <T_5> to take it to the next <T_0> .
look <T_5> , <T_2> generations ago in <T_0> -- <T_6> water <T_3> the <T_7> , <T_4> with firewood <T_1> washing like that .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_3> a marker <T_1> liberation , but <T_0> suffocation by <T_2> minutiae .
so <T_2> we make <T_0> little <T_1> .
and <T_6> think that <T_2> real waste of human waste is that <T_3> are wasting it <T_4> a resource and <T_7> an incredible <T_1> , because <T_0> are a few things <T_5> toilets <T_9> poop itself <T_8> do for us .
<T_1> , here <T_0> 256 <T_2> .
<T_8> questions , <T_3> my <T_7> , <T_2> not hard <T_6> the <T_4> are complicated , <T_9> are hard <T_5> they require <T_0> we be honest <T_1> ourselves .
when <T_1> get older , and you &apos;re all freaked out , <T_2> , <T_0> mentors calm us down .
so by <T_3> , my <T_4> is already 6,000 words <T_2> , <T_5> i <T_1> like i <T_0> stop here .
thank <T_0> , tedx .
they <T_0> be <T_2> : <T_1> up !
this is <T_2> why i didn &apos;t get into trouble <T_1> the length of <T_0> airstrip .
<T_0> strikes <T_1> as practically <T_2> .
<T_4> : these <T_3> a <T_1> of the tests <T_2> did <T_0> we were building the <T_5> .
we <T_1> just like , <T_2> know , ah , <T_3> full <T_0> ourselves .
<T_0> then he has to turn <T_1> .
now , our data <T_8> on <T_3> is <T_2> preliminary , but <T_1> really seems <T_7> these <T_4> feats that <T_5> race car <T_6> are performing <T_0> instinctive .
these people <T_0> different <T_1> .
<T_1> we do a quick show of <T_0> ?
he &apos;s <T_1> a , <T_0> of , cheek-flapping sound .
<T_2> increases <T_0> openness to <T_1> .
so <T_0> did we <T_2> after computing all this <T_1> control ?
well , that &apos;s exactly what i <T_5> to talk about <T_0> , is <T_6> we can <T_2> these <T_3> forces to <T_4> these man-made <T_1> .
she <T_1> nothing <T_5> marilyn , but by the time we &apos;ve made her up <T_9> put wigs and makeup on , <T_6> looks exactly like marilyn , to the extent <T_4> her <T_3> couldn &apos;t recognize her -- <T_0> recognize this look-alike -- in <T_2> photographs , <T_7> i find quite <T_8> .
<T_7> just assumed <T_1> if this <T_0> man and <T_5> psychopathic followers <T_2> calling <T_6> they did jihad , <T_3> that &apos;s what <T_4> must mean .
<T_3> other century was <T_1> of <T_2> , and this <T_4> down a blueprint <T_5> how we <T_0> .
<T_0> you .
<T_1> was <T_3> out of a <T_2> , <T_0> several times .
and <T_2> &apos;s well known by <T_4> that <T_1> who live <T_0> textile <T_3> tend to have high rates of leukemia .
so <T_1> &apos;m an <T_3> of euthanasia , <T_0> i do think we <T_4> to give people back <T_2> control .
now , if there is <T_1> , <T_2> dutch will <T_0> it .
<T_8> really comes from the fact <T_9> certain long-term <T_6> -- health care , where innovation <T_5> it more expensive , <T_7> retirement <T_0> pension , where <T_4> age structure gets worse for you , and just <T_2> -- that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over <T_3> , that you &apos;ve got a <T_1> .
so all of <T_0> colored <T_6> correspond to <T_1> of <T_5> , <T_3> fibers that <T_2> cell bodies <T_4> synapses .
and <T_4> when we <T_5> that <T_6> abe goes away , <T_3> those 7,500 <T_2> go away too , <T_7> sometimes have this <T_1> between <T_8> and the <T_0> .
so , if you talk <T_1> the <T_5> , you &apos;ll hear some music <T_2> your <T_6> ; if <T_0> talk in the <T_3> , then <T_4> would happen .
when he <T_1> fitted , <T_0> his extremely <T_3> eyes , he suddenly <T_4> up <T_2> said , &quot; <T_5> , <T_7> el <T_6> . &quot;
<T_6> transferred to risd <T_7> a <T_8> , and it was <T_9> that i took <T_2> course that <T_3> could on writing , <T_4> it was there that i wrote a story <T_1> a giant orange slug who <T_0> to be <T_5> with this kid .
<T_6> i really <T_1> to share with <T_3> a very <T_4> moment of my life <T_2> the <T_0> of the city of <T_5> .
what <T_0> they <T_1> ?
so i &apos;m like , whoa .
this is <T_0> concept demo , so i <T_1> to make <T_2> clear .
<T_3> two years we <T_2> hopefully be done <T_1> this plan <T_0> taking it to <T_4> .
and <T_0> went to see the <T_1> .
or , more specifically , <T_6> we learned <T_3> the <T_2> of a very <T_0> and <T_4> machine for <T_5> music <T_1> .
the <T_0> model <T_1> barely changed <T_3> the <T_4> 20th <T_2> .
and <T_3> really learned <T_5> lesson during the sex <T_1> of the clinton <T_7> or , <T_4> as i <T_2> them , the <T_0> ol &apos; <T_6> .
and <T_5> &apos;s a <T_4> that is just about to open next <T_1> , the <T_0> home for <T_7> dallas theater <T_6> , <T_3> dee <T_2> charles <T_8> theatre .
<T_4> , there <T_0> many ways of <T_3> the <T_2> of the human <T_1> .
even building <T_6> actually limit the ability for <T_4> to build <T_3> taller <T_5> four <T_0> in many <T_2> , and that &apos;s true <T_1> in the <T_7> .
<T_6> : <T_2> eight-week-old son <T_3> somewhere in here , <T_1> i <T_4> to see if <T_0> can actually <T_5> identify him .
it <T_1> things <T_0> perspective , etc . , etc .
there <T_0> more information <T_4> what &apos;s going on <T_2> kenya <T_5> now than <T_1> one <T_3> can manage .
<T_0> i want to <T_3> how the <T_1> you &apos;re going to get from me is going to <T_4> you <T_2> there .
<T_2> reviewer called <T_0> &quot; <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> all that <T_3> ; you <T_2> not to do anything .
you <T_6> also just sort of give <T_2> input <T_4> then <T_1> and have wolfram alpha <T_3> out <T_0> you &apos;re <T_5> about .
but it appeared to <T_0> that all these years that i &apos;d been working on exploitation -- <T_6> by <T_2> , by moneylenders , by <T_5> -- gave me an insight that probably i was also an <T_4> , because there was no line in <T_1> income tax return <T_8> showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the <T_3> -- those people who have shared their knowledge <T_7> good faith and trust with <T_9> -- and nothing ever went back to them .
<T_1> reacted in asking you <T_2> help , and <T_0> people <T_3> from you .
where <T_1> have the same kind of <T_0> to take <T_2> .
i think <T_1> the <T_2> indian mathematician , <T_0> .
<T_1> am told <T_0> will <T_2> me here .
so , this is what it <T_0> like <T_2> you <T_1> to the <T_3> .
so <T_3> populations of tunas -- that is , we have a <T_4> population , one <T_5> we can <T_8> -- <T_2> go to <T_6> gulf of <T_0> , i <T_1> you that -- <T_7> a <T_9> population .
here <T_5> wonderful <T_4> with good <T_1> and plenty of <T_3> , and <T_2> they were getting things <T_6> predictably all <T_0> time .
i <T_4> her about her wish , <T_2> she <T_3> , &quot; you <T_0> , <T_1> i &apos;ll <T_5> , <T_6> i &apos;ll <T_8> , but <T_7> don &apos;t have a <T_9> . &quot;
helen <T_0> : why <T_2> love , why <T_1> cheat
<T_4> knights templar realized <T_7> quickly that <T_1> couldn &apos;t face the <T_5> on <T_3> alone , and so they <T_6> a <T_2> as a <T_0> enterprise .
<T_2> the ottoman <T_1> , there <T_0> itinerant <T_3> called &quot; <T_4> . &quot;
how <T_0> we go and have <T_4> world where we both have <T_5> and publishing <T_1> the future , just as we basically benefited as <T_2> were growing <T_3> ?
<T_1> of the key questions <T_4> all of <T_0> , &quot; <T_5> there <T_3> outside <T_2> earth ? &quot;
<T_2> wraps <T_1> around <T_6> leg , picks <T_8> up a second time , <T_4> me <T_7> a <T_0> , and he &apos;s able <T_5> get me <T_3> medical attention .
<T_4> , from a <T_1> and values <T_6> , what <T_3> can do <T_2> connect in <T_5> of different <T_0> .
you <T_1> tell that <T_2> the little <T_0> on there .
i <T_0> &apos;t <T_1> this from happening .
all <T_5> , <T_9> many swedish <T_7> and politicians <T_0> business leaders use , every day , u.s.-based <T_8> , like , you know , run windows or osx , or use facebook or linkedin , or store their <T_6> in <T_2> like icloud <T_4> skydrive or dropbox , or maybe use online <T_3> like amazon web services <T_1> sales support ?
so <T_1> man , his name is sathi <T_0> .
and <T_0> was <T_1> amazing year .
and <T_2> country relies <T_1> its <T_4> through military <T_0> , that &apos;s <T_3> .
<T_5> focusing <T_6> a design , maybe <T_2> a <T_0> product , <T_7> was being incremental <T_1> not having <T_4> of an <T_3> .
and what you &apos;re seeing <T_0> is , <T_1> , one of <T_2> most state-of-the-art <T_3> .
and <T_1> i want to <T_4> you <T_2> this <T_0> a <T_3> .
now <T_1> you need to do , <T_7> you &apos;re trying to develop a new <T_8> for <T_6> or alzheimer &apos;s disease <T_3> cancer is to find <T_9> right <T_0> in <T_5> mix that will <T_2> provide benefit and will <T_4> safe .
<T_0> find that <T_1> , <T_6> to be able <T_3> see <T_7> , not <T_4> be <T_2> to see <T_5> .
<T_1> , <T_0> countless meetings at , you know , the portland <T_2> council , <T_4> who knows <T_6> , they said , <T_3> need an <T_7> -- <T_5> we get <T_8> gehry ?
imagine <T_0> spring .
<T_4> &apos;ve actually got a <T_0> that &apos;s got <T_1> bunch <T_2> photos that i &apos;ve done of <T_7> of the <T_3> folks i didn &apos;t get a <T_6> to <T_5> you .
<T_6> , <T_1> mathematicians <T_8> them , <T_2> one or the other of <T_3> pathways : <T_4> through <T_7> discoveries , a problem is identified <T_5> a <T_0> is sought .
<T_1> merkley : online video -- <T_0> , remixed and <T_2>
<T_5> know , one <T_7> the things that <T_9> think <T_8> ted <T_3> to do is tell all the <T_0> about all <T_2> great lectures that are on ted , and there &apos;s all kinds of great <T_4> on the internet to get <T_1> kids <T_6> on .
<T_3> do <T_0> every day , <T_5> reading <T_1> , watching television <T_2> going to the <T_4> .
<T_0> that , <T_2> information can just <T_1> really cool .
we <T_1> were sort of <T_2> as the <T_4> who run only <T_3> small <T_0> .
<T_2> found <T_0> institution , and you use <T_3> institution to <T_4> the <T_1> of the <T_5> .
rory <T_0> : why <T_1> matters
<T_1> sure enough , <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> insect .
and <T_1> proportion is <T_0> genetically <T_2> .
so <T_4> you &apos;re thinking about <T_0> your kid <T_3> tinkering school , they do <T_2> back bruised , <T_1> and <T_5> .
no <T_0> around this time .
this is <T_1> on <T_0> f. scott fitzgerald short story .
we <T_1> a page out of xkcd , and <T_0> said , &quot; <T_2> back .
now <T_5> &apos;m going <T_0> focus on <T_3> because angiogenesis <T_2> a <T_6> of <T_4> , every type <T_1> cancer .
<T_2> has <T_1> that <T_0> in it .
<T_3> the other thing is they &apos;re working <T_0> artificial <T_1> for <T_2> blind .
<T_7> , <T_3> about the <T_5> . <T_6> hardware will do <T_4> it &apos;s rich enough <T_0> stable <T_1> to carry <T_2> program . &quot;
<T_2> was actually <T_1> under two quite <T_0> acts <T_3> the u.k .
<T_4> saw <T_5> similarities <T_2> one of <T_3> photographs , but <T_0> &apos;t quite make a <T_1> identification .
that is <T_0> .
so let me <T_0> you how this <T_1> .
now , how <T_0> you <T_3> -- <T_6> you know , <T_5> profession , the <T_1> profession doesn &apos;t see <T_2> that <T_4> .
architectural <T_1> is <T_0> glamorous .
so when <T_0> think about scaling up <T_5> materials , we <T_3> start <T_9> about <T_4> interventions <T_6> repair of <T_2> , or <T_1> of parts <T_8> a city that are damaged <T_7> water .
what , of course , happens with that is violence , which we see when we talk <T_3> the ghettos and we talk about , you know , south central l.a. and this <T_7> of stuff , and which eventually , <T_8> channeled , becomes , you know , evolves <T_1> manifests itself as riots -- like <T_6> one in france two years ago , <T_9> i live , which <T_5> everybody , because <T_4> thought , &quot; oh well , france is <T_2> liberal <T_0> . &quot;
people watch <T_0> all over <T_1> country <T_2> in public <T_3> .
so <T_4> do <T_5> feel <T_3> the lights go out on <T_9> global economy <T_2> your mind , when <T_7> assumptions <T_1> the future <T_0> away and <T_6> very <T_8> emerges ?
<T_1> put it <T_2> the front <T_0> of your <T_3> .
<T_7> think you <T_3> to <T_1> the <T_6> of what <T_0> &apos;re trying to do <T_2> how <T_4> gets done and the machinery of <T_8> it gets done <T_9> automation allows you to make that <T_5> .
<T_0> you very much .
<T_0> i have a <T_1> .
<T_0> out <T_4> edges ; go for the <T_3> ; <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> big market .
we <T_1> just to <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_8> can be <T_5> jefferson <T_2> what <T_6> was talking about <T_1> he said , &quot; if a <T_3> expects to be ignorant and <T_0> in a <T_4> of civilization , it expects what <T_7> was , and never <T_9> be . &quot;
<T_3> : <T_1> need to <T_0> people what <T_2> to bring .
<T_3> far as i &apos;m concerned , this is <T_2> we &apos;re <T_1> to do these <T_4> of de-extinction <T_0> .
and <T_0> we depict our <T_2> about <T_1> history <T_4> the form of <T_3> like this .
<T_0> fundamental forms of ferns followed , to bear <T_2> that <T_1> seeds .
<T_2> along the way , i &apos;m kind of making <T_0> and <T_1> other <T_3> .
<T_2> in writing <T_3> of the <T_4> , it <T_1> in <T_0> third valley .
i <T_5> my <T_8> of hungarian mentors had come <T_7> an end , but almost immediately i met francis robicsek , a <T_0> doctor -- actually a heart surgeon <T_4> charlotte , <T_9> carolina , then in his late seventies -- who had been a <T_2> in open-heart surgery , and , tinkering away in his garage behind <T_1> house , had invented <T_3> of the devices that are standard parts of <T_6> procedures .

it was about <T_6> who <T_7> born with deformities , <T_8> their parents felt that once <T_4> were born with <T_1> deformities , they were not good enough to live in the <T_3> , so <T_0> were given some <T_9> to take and <T_5> a result they <T_2> .

<T_2> &apos;s the one <T_0> reminds us <T_4> we &apos;re <T_1> part of a <T_3> whole .
they used to win the gold medals <T_0> weightlifting <T_1> wrestling , <T_4> four <T_6> in <T_9> olympics , and they were the <T_8> celebrities <T_7> communism , <T_5> a <T_3> lifestyle to go <T_2> it .
<T_6> i <T_1> that it &apos;s <T_5> interesting , also , <T_0> it <T_4> with two <T_3> issues , which are <T_2> waters and <T_7> .
<T_1> is <T_0> closest .
now <T_9> of these <T_1> fine <T_7> , but <T_5> really have missed <T_4> essential point , which is <T_8> &apos;s <T_3> about the <T_0> above , <T_6> &apos;s about the <T_2> below .

i <T_2> get you <T_4> right <T_3> , and the whole thing could <T_1> very <T_0> . &apos; &apos; ha , <T_5> , ha .
<T_3> went <T_1> africa , and we <T_2> the <T_0> thing .
and <T_1> at this moment <T_2> want to ask <T_0> celebrate emma <T_3> me .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_3> real <T_5> : doodling <T_2> really to make <T_1> marks to help yourself <T_0> .
i <T_2> that &apos;s <T_0> of the <T_1> why the kindle is <T_3> great .

washington ? i <T_7> &apos;t even <T_9> to talk about the <T_1> and <T_2> in place <T_3> the bottom <T_5> reality <T_6> the available jobs <T_8> i don <T_4> really <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s take a <T_2> look at <T_3> number <T_0> here .
<T_6> : i <T_2> going to use you <T_3> this , <T_1> i <T_0> i might want to <T_5> back another <T_4> .
<T_2> great <T_1> of it is that the <T_3> have <T_5> very <T_0> conception of cultural <T_4> .

why <T_2> you be doing <T_4> ? <T_5> should just <T_6> that once , <T_3> it <T_7> know <T_0> all your <T_1> are .
<T_5> &apos;m <T_2> tillett wright , <T_4> i &apos;m an <T_0> born <T_3> raised in new york <T_1> .
i <T_4> created <T_5> menu <T_1> allowed people <T_3> choose <T_2> amount and volume of <T_0> that they wanted to consume .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> little bit <T_4> from <T_2> to spin in some <T_0> of positive conclusion .
<T_7> nuclear launch key : the one <T_8> the top <T_9> the <T_0> of <T_4> one i <T_6> on ebay ; the one on the <T_3> is the <T_5> i made for myself , because i <T_1> &apos;t afford the one <T_2> ebay .
that &apos;s when you start <T_0> imprint on <T_5> child that &quot; <T_6> are <T_7> , you are <T_3> from <T_2> other <T_4> in the <T_1> .
nm : it worked . <T_1> : <T_0> worked .
<T_1> &apos;ve started in <T_0> an organization -- a non-profit organization -- called project <T_2> .
<T_4> to <T_2> touch with the basic rhythms of <T_1> biology <T_0> our <T_3> .
and <T_0> it came in from the <T_1> .
<T_3> very first <T_7> , starting when <T_9> went in <T_2> , <T_0> a <T_5> weeks later alan shepherd , there <T_6> five <T_8> space flights in the <T_4> -- the very first <T_1> .
<T_3> know you <T_5> &apos;t think <T_6> you &apos;re pretty <T_2> or <T_1> enough <T_0> talented enough or <T_4> enough .
<T_4> then the <T_5> didn &apos;t go and <T_0> was so <T_6> , <T_2> i <T_3> remaining a fan <T_1> yours .
in 1943 , t.s. <T_1> the &quot; four <T_0> . &quot;
<T_7> you tell me you would <T_0> to <T_8> more in <T_6> future , let &apos;s say every <T_5> you &apos;re going to be saving more automatically and it &apos;s going to go away from your paycheck to the 401 <T_2> before <T_9> see it , before you touch <T_4> , before you get <T_1> issue of <T_3> gratification .
<T_0> of the <T_2> that the engineer , karl <T_1> , <T_3> were fairly <T_5> in <T_4> .
<T_3> i <T_4> afraid <T_5> change , <T_6> i <T_0> so used to <T_1> guy who <T_2> just walked .
<T_0> so that &apos;s really <T_2> only take-home message that <T_1> have for <T_3> .
now , <T_0> of the ways you can make them not <T_2> is <T_1> ddt .
so all in all i have <T_1> very <T_2> ph.d. student <T_0> south africa .
he &apos;s seeing his <T_0> brain .
and <T_0> , these <T_2> i <T_1> new hopes .
freeways .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> argument <T_6> why <T_1> need to step into the lab <T_4> really measure the <T_2> of technology <T_5> the <T_7> .
you , however , are blessed with the <T_0> of influence .
we were told , we were <T_3> , that the <T_1> meat and dairy and <T_4> we <T_2> , <T_5> healthier <T_0> &apos;d be .
<T_4> , you <T_0> be <T_3> , well , how <T_1> they do <T_2> ?
we also <T_2> it <T_1> being stress-free <T_0> on holiday .
fc : <T_4> . so <T_6> took the <T_7> off <T_2> school today to be <T_9> , <T_5> he is — -- <T_0> is , by <T_3> way , a straight-a + student in the ninth <T_8> in <T_1> school in boston .
<T_0> as <T_3> , <T_2> the other way <T_1> the loop .
<T_0> you .
a <T_7> of years ago , we had 1,750 <T_3> all together in <T_0> square in <T_6> town , and <T_5> ate <T_8> at the <T_1> moment , and this <T_2> still big , <T_4> news .
<T_3> amount of resources <T_1> put <T_0> are <T_2> .
and you <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_1> we &apos;re going back to sleep .
because <T_8> are two <T_6> aspects <T_4> democracy : there &apos;s electoral competition , which <T_0> how you acquire power , <T_7> there <T_9> checks and <T_2> , <T_1> determine how <T_3> use <T_5> .
<T_1> was the <T_0> digital <T_2> producer in tokyo .
<T_3> was to take <T_0> the things <T_4> are known as front of house and back of house <T_5> redefine them <T_2> above house and <T_1> house .
<T_0> hold <T_2> position <T_5> power <T_3> authority , <T_4> those who lead <T_1> us .
as <T_1> can imagine , even <T_6> you know <T_8> , this should be intuitive , ok -- <T_3> stars that are <T_5> to the <T_4> in the middle will be <T_9> at a higher speed <T_0> those that <T_7> further <T_2> here , ok .
the shared <T_0> are also treated in the same manner , where <T_1> are decorated <T_3> faux marble <T_2> .
<T_0> , <T_2> &apos;ve been worrying about that <T_1> .
<T_9> recently , <T_6> &apos;ve been wondering <T_7> it might be possible to take advantage of <T_1> insight , to actually find <T_4> to improve <T_2> world , <T_5> do <T_0> better , to actually fix <T_3> , not just <T_8> things .
so , <T_1> locked myself <T_3> a room , figured out <T_4> content , <T_0> the document , and wrote it <T_2> plain <T_5> .
<T_1> path <T_2> , you &apos;re going <T_0> be a <T_3> .
<T_3> first one , the electron , was discovered in <T_8> , and the <T_6> one , this <T_2> called the tau neutrino , in the <T_9> 2000 . actually just -- i was going <T_0> say , just <T_1> the road <T_5> chicago . i <T_4> it &apos;s a <T_7> country , america , isn &apos;t it ?
<T_1> are <T_0> global citizens .
the most <T_1> changes <T_3> us today have to do with data <T_5> what data is doing to shape the kinds of <T_4> relations <T_0> will be possible for <T_6> in <T_2> future .
<T_1> took <T_0> diplomacy .
i &apos;ve had this checked by <T_3> two <T_0> consumer <T_2> lawyers in <T_1> country .
in fact , i bought <T_3> gold-plated <T_4> edition and it comes with <T_5> little <T_6> of paper that <T_1> , &quot; <T_0> &apos;t use this <T_7> to make <T_2> . &quot;
different <T_2> most people . <T_0> did <T_1> mean ?
<T_1> designed <T_0> ?
<T_5> &apos;ve <T_1> never opened <T_3> the toolbars , but <T_2> you have <T_4> type in is this little , <T_0> window down <T_6> .
now , <T_1> is <T_2> lowest of the <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_1> nice <T_3> do , <T_0> it &apos;s a must-do .
journalism <T_0> provided a channel <T_3> people &apos;s natural sense <T_2> generosity , and <T_4> readers <T_1> .
<T_0> of you <T_1> smart .
the <T_3> way to find its <T_2> is , <T_4> , just <T_1> watch it <T_0> .
the reason <T_3> can <T_2> so well <T_0> , even <T_7> there is so <T_6> people on <T_5> , is because of <T_4> power of <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_0> what will happen <T_1> .
then i <T_2> a sanitary <T_4> and <T_3> it to shanti -- my <T_1> &apos;s name is <T_0> .
<T_0> once <T_4> contested , our way <T_3> measuring outcomes has actually <T_2> become the <T_1> .
<T_2> it &apos;s <T_4> used most <T_1> in <T_0> in the aftermath of <T_3> earthquake .
<T_1> principle , you could imagine <T_0> find sand dunes <T_5> any slope angle <T_4> a beach , and <T_3> , the slope angles of sand dunes are typically <T_2> 30 , 35 <T_6> .
<T_0> my <T_2> son , <T_1> studied chinese in <T_3> .
so we <T_1> nine other <T_4> that interact <T_2> oxytocin , <T_0> they <T_5> &apos;t have any <T_3> .
we &apos;re <T_1> waiting for <T_2> to <T_0> us . &quot;
where do <T_1> come up with <T_0> ideas ?
i &apos;m going to just take <T_8> couple of minutes <T_4> explain it -- <T_0> in world religions , on world religions , for <T_1> of our children <T_2> primary school , in <T_3> school , <T_7> public <T_9> , in <T_6> schools and <T_5> home schooling .
i <T_0> switch to <T_2> data views . that &apos;s what &apos;s neat about this <T_1> here .
<T_2> &apos;ll watch <T_3> . <T_0> &apos;ll <T_1> this other thing . &quot;
let me <T_1> with <T_0> arts .
<T_0> airplane patent holders <T_1> not left a <T_3> whether they &apos;d license their patents <T_2> not .
what are <T_3> other <T_1> of putting the <T_0> amount of space <T_2> the <T_4> ?
so <T_0> would encourage you <T_5> to grab <T_4> play-doh , grab <T_1> salt , grab some <T_2> and start <T_3> .
it was not until <T_2> 14th <T_3> that an italian <T_6> recognized the <T_4> as a <T_0> temple , upholstered <T_1> flesh and <T_5> .
she <T_3> at the top of <T_5> through elementary school , middle school , <T_2> scored brilliantly on the <T_9> examinations so that she <T_7> the <T_6> <T_0> in her <T_4> , ever , to come <T_8> the united <T_1> on scholarship .
why ?
then <T_2> things happened <T_0> more <T_1> .
<T_2> would be <T_1> to <T_0> from <T_4> language to <T_3> .
yin <T_1> yang are <T_2> necessary , <T_4> night <T_0> day , for <T_3> functioning of the world .
<T_2> i also was <T_0> with personal <T_1> of <T_3> .
so little billy <T_5> to <T_1> , and <T_0> sits down <T_3> the teacher <T_2> , &quot; <T_6> does <T_4> father do ? &quot;
how <T_0> is <T_1> ?
you <T_2> think <T_5> &apos;s a <T_3> right there . in fact , that &apos;s <T_0> stamp . <T_4> used a <T_1> to defend canada &apos;s borders .
<T_2> yet , <T_1> few <T_3> earlier , death never <T_0> their <T_4> .
this <T_1> the planet <T_0> .
<T_2> let &apos;s talk about <T_0> shifts of power that are occurring <T_3> the <T_1> .
so within <T_4> next few <T_1> , we &apos;ll be able to turn up the <T_2> a little <T_5> , render <T_3> universe <T_0> audio .
that is that private <T_3> has been <T_1> around , <T_5> that <T_0> me that this <T_6> is <T_2> to <T_4> .
there &apos;s <T_3> to be a <T_5> of cheap rocketry that &apos;s going to come online <T_1> about <T_6> or seven <T_4> that gets us <T_0> the low <T_2> very cheaply .
<T_0> , he &apos;s anonymous . <T_2> name <T_1> not <T_3> .
well , saving that <T_2> , <T_0> percent of the fuel <T_3> light vehicles costs <T_4> 57 cents <T_1> saved <T_5> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> idea .
<T_2> now <T_0> from <T_1> are talking to me .
<T_7> there was an incident <T_2> where a hundred kids died <T_8> some <T_6> or where , say , a hundred kids were <T_1> and then rescued <T_5> special forces , i mean , it would be <T_3> over the <T_4> for a week , <T_0> ?
trying <T_2> replace pancreas , trying <T_4> replace <T_1> that <T_3> help us <T_0> parkinson &apos;s .
the <T_5> reason is that when <T_1> do get <T_2> in it , as i <T_6> should , <T_4> tend to <T_0> the most appalling <T_3> .
<T_7> algorithms <T_0> a <T_3> full of men that wanted to take <T_1> out on lots of <T_6> -- what <T_5> out <T_4> be truly awful <T_2> .
<T_5> , i <T_1> in the <T_9> 10 <T_7> , we &apos;ll find these <T_0> , <T_6> then , of <T_2> , our <T_4> view of life <T_8> the universe will <T_3> .
when <T_0> do my work , i have <T_1> kinds of <T_2> .
<T_5> the <T_7> on the right there fires <T_0> there &apos;s a <T_4> to the south , <T_6> it &apos;s the drop at the <T_2> of the table <T_9> a <T_3> or even the gap between <T_8> tables that are <T_1> apart .
and the <T_0> of <T_3> is <T_2> to change one thing <T_1> another , to change geometry <T_4> language .
five thousand <T_1> -- <T_2> &apos;s still <T_0> .
<T_2> take all of the <T_4> , <T_5> of the chaos , <T_7> of the noise , <T_9> out of that comes <T_8> precise <T_0> distribution <T_1> the way <T_6> in <T_3> conflict .
and after <T_1> war <T_4> interviewed a lot of <T_0> soldiers and <T_5> about <T_2> experience of <T_3> in battle .
<T_1> like airport <T_2> control , as <T_0> start to go past <T_3> they &apos;re called back -- and they &apos;re called back and back and <T_4> .

<T_2> then you <T_0> , <T_1> economists ?
<T_8> do they <T_0> it ? it &apos;s for things <T_7> this : gene <T_3> alabama drives out there with this <T_1> that he &apos;s built <T_2> x-ray sensors , video cameras , festooned with <T_6> , and he succeeds getting <T_5> 100,000 feet , <T_4> the atmosphere , seeing a <T_9> blue line of space .
<T_0> is a <T_2> of optical <T_1> , right ?

<T_8> , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like <T_5> , <T_6> this is what <T_1> was like <T_4> the 1950s <T_7> the same boat in <T_3> same <T_2> on the same <T_0> on the same <T_9> .
<T_2> we &apos;re at <T_4> time <T_1> boldness <T_0> required to <T_3> forward .
in <T_5> , we <T_2> our <T_0> slate of <T_3> , &quot; <T_4> ball , &quot; &quot; north <T_7> , &quot; &quot; <T_8> &quot; <T_9> &quot; good night <T_6> good <T_1> . &quot;
<T_1> then they often <T_0> there .
<T_0> do <T_1> reconfigure it ?
as <T_0> who &apos;s dyslexic , you also have some quite <T_1> situations .
and <T_6> &apos;d <T_9> to <T_5> to you that <T_4> have sequenced the human <T_8> , we know everything about the sequence of the gene , the language of the gene , the alphabet of the gene , <T_0> we know <T_2> , but <T_3> , about the language <T_1> alphabet <T_7> form .
and <T_7> octopus . ain &apos;t that <T_9> ? now , <T_8> spooked <T_0> so <T_1> took off <T_4> a <T_5> of ink , and when <T_2> lands the <T_3> says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve <T_6> seen .
and this is <T_2> great protection of <T_5> pedestrian <T_4> , and <T_3> repurposing <T_6> some colonial <T_1> to do <T_0> .
<T_1> , <T_0> types <T_2> pivots .
now , from the shah &apos;s perspective , though , he wanted <T_0> keep this <T_8> secret <T_2> possible , so <T_1> yitzhak rabin , <T_5> instance , traveled <T_9> iran <T_7> the &apos; 70s , he <T_4> wore a wig so that <T_6> one would <T_3> him .
now , it &apos;s <T_8> to program <T_5> robot <T_3> do delicate <T_0> like this , but it turns out <T_4> colleague , pieter <T_9> , <T_2> &apos;s here at <T_6> , has develeloped <T_7> new set of <T_1> for teaching robots from example .
and <T_0> was like , &quot; <T_3> &apos;re the <T_1> , <T_2> . &quot;
<T_5> other person <T_0> -- <T_7> , if <T_4> &apos;re here , <T_3> up -- is a <T_1> , &#91; the &#93; <T_6> swahili <T_2> .
this <T_1> is someone <T_0> &apos;d never want <T_2> play <T_3> with .
we <T_5> draw in <T_0> liquid sample , or <T_1> can actually take <T_2> solid <T_4> from the <T_3> .
<T_4> get more -- <T_1> , <T_3> , <T_0> where <T_2> that ?
and <T_0> it &apos;s ballasted with <T_1> at the very bottom .
<T_8> some <T_2> now , it &apos;s been <T_3> that if you pay <T_4> to the carrier <T_1> of the gps signal , <T_5> if you have <T_0> internet connection , then you can go from meter level to centimeter level , <T_6> millimeter-level <T_7> .
<T_0> , some people <T_2> there are oil <T_1> .

<T_1> lewis : don &apos;t take <T_2> for <T_0>
what <T_3> might mean for <T_6> movements all over <T_1> moment , <T_7> &quot; <T_2> , <T_0> &quot; seems <T_5> prescient totally <T_4> .
<T_1> big <T_3> happened : first , a bunch of new ideas <T_5> linguistics that came <T_2> studying <T_8> computational <T_7> ; and second , <T_6> realization that having actual computable <T_0> completely <T_9> how one can set <T_4> understanding language .
when <T_7> came home in 1955 <T_1> university <T_9> the <T_4> of martin <T_2> king , a <T_3> of people <T_0> home at that time <T_6> started having arguments with <T_8> parents and <T_5> .
<T_0> resnick : welcome to the <T_1>
and also , of course , with <T_2> , there &apos;s , <T_3> , the specific <T_4> and <T_1> specific <T_0> set .
<T_1> gaze went to <T_5> young <T_0> as <T_4> wiped the face of <T_3> dying <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;ll <T_3> look away . <T_1> , go <T_0> and <T_4> them up , now .
<T_0> , we &apos;re sort of <T_3> the world around <T_1> to create our <T_2> design solutions .
and <T_0> award <T_4> about a celebration for <T_3> building <T_1> had been in use over a <T_2> period of time .
this is <T_5> our <T_0> economy is <T_4> upon us , particularly <T_2> in that left-hand <T_1> : <T_3> .
in <T_1> , <T_2> whole era of <T_0> medicine is completely <T_3> .
they <T_2> a network <T_0> small computing <T_1> , <T_3> in networks .
it &apos;s how they <T_1> the <T_0> vents .
they were <T_1> to <T_0> concerns .
the <T_2> has crossed the halfway <T_1> a few <T_0> ago .
so <T_0> of my daughters <T_3> out , <T_1> get <T_2> minutes of overreacting <T_4> all week .
we <T_1> 81 <T_0> of local government .
we &apos;re going to <T_4> you <T_6> many times a <T_2> four-gram appeared <T_5> books <T_3> 1801 , 1802 , <T_0> , all the <T_1> up to 2008 .
<T_3> works the same <T_0> with <T_5> president <T_2> the musical <T_6> , whose <T_4> da musica portraits wind up on <T_7> business <T_1> .
our <T_3> have to scream at <T_4> with these <T_1> of <T_2> in order <T_0> get <T_5> attention .
<T_0> we &apos;re building that <T_1> .
this <T_0> that i &apos;m clicking <T_1> here is meant to be <T_3> of a <T_5> graph , showing the <T_4> moments <T_2> adrenaline .
and <T_0> algorithms <T_6> we <T_4> to do insects turned out <T_1> be the <T_5> for <T_2> to do their <T_3> .
he <T_1> , as i <T_4> , <T_9> get in the <T_3> with evil , to <T_0> denounce , and became <T_2> obsequious <T_7> he won the nickname serbio , for instance , and <T_6> when he negotiated <T_5> the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to <T_8> the room .
<T_1> , let &apos;s make <T_0> he &apos;s <T_2> . &quot;
<T_5> &apos;s got three <T_4> -- in <T_2> , in <T_3> , in sydney -- <T_1> one freeway , <T_7> electric <T_0> that <T_6> them .
this <T_0> was taken from <T_1> orbiting <T_2> .
you know , we &apos;re getting into <T_8> , <T_9> want to be there , <T_4> you <T_0> , <T_7> are <T_5> many <T_1> who won &apos;t have <T_6> access to <T_3> a <T_2> .
and <T_0> celebrates <T_2> the way &quot; dirty jobs &quot; guys <T_3> it has <T_4> be <T_1> .
so , <T_3> gloves <T_1> a little bit <T_0> on me , but <T_2> it is .
this is <T_1> brand new <T_0> .
<T_0> the <T_4> consequence <T_2> that <T_6> did not know <T_5> people <T_1> me <T_3> exist in literature .
<T_5> they are <T_0> poisonous or really <T_1> be used at less <T_3> a <T_4> than <T_2> .
and <T_0> year , <T_3> is <T_2> compelled to <T_1> .
i <T_2> , <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> i heard <T_3> up .
<T_0> don &apos;t want to feel like <T_1> impostor .
<T_0> does this <T_1> ?
and also , <T_1> you create the <T_0> possible <T_2> that <T_3> would <T_4> let you get away with ?
<T_0> work shows <T_1> we &apos;re living at <T_3> 1.3 <T_2> .
<T_8> also tried to take <T_0> more directly <T_6> approach with <T_2> genomes <T_3> 13 <T_9> organisms , and we <T_4> to <T_7> all of those , to see <T_5> they had in <T_1> .
<T_0> haven &apos;t included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
and i think <T_7> giving kids toys <T_4> this and letting <T_8> replay dynamics , very long-term dynamics over the short term , <T_9> getting <T_6> sense of <T_3> we &apos;re doing now , what it &apos;s going to be like in 100 <T_5> , i think <T_0> is the most effective <T_2> i can be <T_1> to help the world .
the only way <T_0> could get around was <T_1> on his belly <T_2> this .
the <T_1> names <T_2> in <T_0> of you .
<T_0> we went down <T_3> the basement . and i <T_1> up this <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;s &apos; <T_5> , entertainment and <T_7> . &apos; &quot; and <T_3> said , &quot; <T_6> , <T_4> design a story when you make it up , <T_8> &apos;s entertainment <T_0> you <T_9> it , and <T_2> &apos;re going to use a microphone . &quot;
the more <T_0> our <T_2> have been , the more equal <T_1> have <T_3> becoming .
just <T_1> minutes of online game play a <T_4> was enough <T_5> create dramatic <T_6> in <T_2> and long-term <T_0> in <T_3> .
the <T_5> story creates <T_1> , and <T_2> problem <T_6> stereotypes <T_7> not <T_3> they <T_0> untrue , but that they <T_4> incomplete .
and <T_9> feel blessed and <T_7> that <T_0> week , <T_1> tuesday -- and <T_8> every friday also -- i <T_4> once again celebrate in the <T_3> of my bones the very essence <T_6> living in <T_5> on the <T_2> .
you <T_0> do a lot of <T_1> .
<T_0> i started <T_2> steal from food <T_1> in illegal <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;ll been engulfed by <T_1> red <T_0> . &quot;
and fortunately , i <T_0> his <T_1> .
<T_6> even if <T_4> &apos;ve had <T_7> with <T_2> for a very <T_3> time , don &apos;t you still <T_0> things <T_1> , &quot; <T_5> we get <T_8> usual ? &quot;
she said , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s <T_3> . &quot; when i <T_2> that night , she called him and left a message -- <T_9> story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; honey , i love <T_7> , i just want <T_0> to know i want to marry you . it <T_1> stupid of <T_5> . &quot; she was asleep , because it was 3 a.m. for us , when he called her <T_8> from the top and said , &quot; honey , i can &apos;t <T_6> you what this means . &quot;
<T_9> this is another thing <T_0> i did -- <T_1> know working -- everybody <T_4> to watch somebody <T_5> , <T_8> not many <T_7> have a chance to watch <T_6> draw in -- a <T_2> of people at the <T_3> time , to evidence a single drawing .
and so we <T_5> these <T_4> sensors <T_3> processors , <T_2> these robots can fly <T_0> without <T_1> .
clay <T_4> with <T_0> in port-au-prince . <T_3> was <T_2> with us <T_1> chile .
so let &apos;s take one <T_4> that <T_2> face , <T_3> mornings , <T_1> talk about how <T_0> can help .
<T_0> is <T_2> light of <T_1> wife , noor .
<T_0> actually <T_1> someone with some <T_2> earlier .
and then <T_1> got my <T_0> .
not a <T_1> one of those <T_3> is <T_0> ; <T_2> a single one of those cells <T_4> who you <T_5> , <T_6> cares .
today <T_0> &apos;s $ 10,000 . <T_2> year <T_1> &apos;s $ 1,000 .
ak : other emotional stuff .

<T_2> know because <T_0> &apos;ve been <T_6> down so many <T_3> i get <T_4> sickness <T_1> from standing up for <T_5> .
<T_0> there <T_3> some concern that <T_2> some parts of the country <T_4> might be <T_1> suppression .
but <T_0> 1,400 dollars , it &apos;s still <T_2> expensive <T_3> people <T_1> kamal .
the <T_5> increases in its <T_7> , in <T_6> brightness , and finally , at about 12 <T_8> years <T_1> it first started , the <T_3> is consumed by a <T_9> sun , <T_2> this <T_4> what &apos;s <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s start with <T_1> world of <T_2> .
<T_0> then you <T_1> maybe wash <T_2> dna <T_3> and <T_4> the circuit left over .
<T_7> do <T_0> see any irony <T_3> the <T_4> that , in <T_9> for you to <T_6> that light , <T_1> have to , yourself , <T_5> secrecy <T_2> your <T_8> ?
<T_2> member : <T_1> kind of triggers are <T_0> looking for ?
i <T_2> order foreign language <T_1> in the middle of the <T_6> , <T_3> for parisian <T_4> , and leave video <T_5> that get picked up <T_0> .
<T_6> that <T_2> most countries in <T_1> and <T_5> , many countries <T_0> africa and <T_4> few <T_3> asia .
<T_5> and my colleagues <T_0> aron <T_4> lucy <T_2> and <T_3> , have put 37 people who are <T_6> in love <T_1> a functional <T_7> .
many <T_5> ago , <T_2> we first started going <T_0> , she was working <T_3> the bbc <T_4> britain , and <T_1> was , at that stage , working in <T_6> .
and <T_1> technician said , &quot; well , ma &apos;am , what <T_0> you mean your <T_2> is squeaking ? &quot;
so when we would <T_6> at <T_4> , this is how <T_3> really got involved <T_2> biology and <T_1> is by <T_5> at <T_0> cells in the <T_7> .
<T_1> need to <T_5> the <T_0> that institutions cause to <T_2> , <T_3> the better <T_4> that exist .
my approach to attacking creationism <T_5> to <T_0> religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against <T_9> ill of religion , <T_3> i &apos;m <T_4> do so in the words of <T_1> late douglas adams , a <T_7> friend <T_6> , if he <T_8> came to <T_2> , certainly should have been invited .
and so it &apos;s really -- it &apos;s <T_3> how <T_4> , you know , <T_1> was made in 1997 , which is <T_5> time of <T_7> -- the military dictatorship , <T_8> worst <T_0> of nigerian <T_6> , <T_2> post-colonial <T_9> .
<T_1> hope to <T_5> , our <T_3> , to <T_4> in all the <T_0> in all <T_2> .

<T_7> if during one of <T_5> days your <T_4> spiked to <T_3> for <T_2> hours , and you <T_1> tylenol <T_6> got <T_9> , etc . , i <T_0> totally <T_8> it .
<T_1> i <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_3> on . &quot;
and <T_1> we &apos;re trying <T_2> change <T_0> experience .
and , likewise , we infected them <T_1> parainfluenza-3 -- <T_0> &apos;s a <T_2> -- and <T_3> see <T_4> little barcode here .
<T_2> first <T_5> this man , <T_6> delano <T_3> , who began his <T_0> unprecedented journey way back <T_9> his own first election , way back in a simpler <T_8> , <T_1> back in 1932 -- the year alberto giacometti made &quot; the palace <T_7> four <T_4> the morning . &quot;
that &apos;s the problem that we &apos;re <T_4> to <T_6> at <T_3> -- that <T_2> and the other <T_1> nerds <T_5> romotive are <T_0> with solving .
<T_3> can wait as <T_2> as you <T_0> , but <T_1> when <T_5> want <T_4> pressure released .
<T_2> learned about <T_0> people who could be <T_1> .
<T_2> , the <T_0> c. this <T_1> critical .
<T_2> didn &apos;t <T_3> up , and there was action <T_0> these <T_1> .
the <T_5> one is the famous one , <T_2> printing press : <T_0> type , oil-based <T_1> , that <T_6> complex <T_4> innovations <T_3> made printing possible and turned <T_8> upside-down , <T_7> in the middle of the <T_9> .
a <T_1> of all the <T_2> commute <T_0> bike .
it <T_2> &apos;t <T_0> cleverness of <T_1> sheep at all .
<T_2> is <T_1> being used in regular <T_0> imaging .
and <T_6> years later , <T_0> , we <T_3> with <T_5> company from mali , <T_9> sogolon <T_4> troupe of <T_2> , where we made a <T_1> about <T_7> tall <T_8> .
<T_3> one would even <T_1> it , because <T_2> one had a clue <T_5> it <T_4> cause <T_0> failure .
that <T_1> me know <T_0> context .
that is why the <T_0> with <T_2> is <T_5> to come -- <T_1> only come -- from <T_3> open-source kind of <T_4> .
so <T_2> find myself asking : where <T_1> music in all of <T_0> ?
and <T_3> know <T_8> kids <T_2> like <T_5> they &apos;ve been asleep for like an <T_4> , <T_7> &apos;s like <T_0> took five <T_1> -- you know , they &apos;re all over the <T_6> .
i like <T_0> physical <T_1> .
<T_0> technology was <T_1> itself to be robust <T_2> scalable .
<T_3> yet , <T_2> &apos;ve taken <T_1> idea and made it my <T_0> .
<T_1> you very <T_0> .
you all <T_1> ted <T_2> , the <T_0> ?
we can <T_5> now visit <T_7> patients <T_8> -- <T_1> is the <T_3> ; if <T_2> &apos;m a <T_6> , visit <T_0> clinic , visit a <T_4> .
now , <T_3> , shakespeare gives the <T_1> , juliet , a <T_4> that belongs <T_0> something else , the <T_2> .
<T_1> this still <T_0> .
we <T_5> a little bit worried that <T_3> might think <T_8> &apos;d been <T_1> problems to suit our argument <T_9> just manufactured this evidence , so <T_6> also did <T_0> paper <T_7> the british medical journal on the <T_2> index <T_4> child well-being .
one <T_2> i knew <T_0> was a <T_4> at a <T_7> that i ran at <T_5> rockefeller <T_6> was <T_3> ingrid <T_1> .
i started doing some research then , <T_6> this <T_3> the 25-year journey , and <T_1> finding out that actually human beings <T_4> primates have <T_2> smaller <T_9> than should <T_7> the size for <T_5> body weight <T_0> far larger <T_8> .
<T_0> you know what &apos;s <T_2> ? <T_3> &apos;m <T_1> one <T_4> them .
<T_7> libeskind : <T_8> . we <T_0> to <T_4> ourselves of <T_5> notion that we <T_3> authoritarian , <T_6> we <T_1> determine everything <T_2> happens .
<T_0> i started thinking about <T_6> , <T_2> i was obviously , as i <T_4> to you , very much <T_5> by these <T_3> , <T_7> to <T_8> sense <T_1> .
and <T_3> bible says <T_4> david laid up great <T_0> of <T_6> , and which <T_2> have <T_8> , <T_7> in present-day palestine , there are <T_5> of that <T_1> .
so he was <T_8> many <T_7> core principles of design , about how to experiment with new ideas , how <T_9> take complex ideas <T_3> break them down <T_0> simpler parts , how to collaborate with <T_6> people on your projects , about how to find and fix bugs when <T_4> go wrong , how to keep persistent <T_2> to persevere in the <T_5> of frustrations when things aren &apos;t working <T_1> .
<T_2> , <T_3> &apos;t build a reformer <T_0> a <T_1> .
we &apos;re dealing with <T_5> , and <T_9> &apos;re dealing with <T_6> that <T_4> admit <T_3> , and the <T_1> tend <T_0> look things a <T_8> more like two and <T_7> is four , and if you get 4.0 it &apos;s better , <T_2> 4.000 is even better .
<T_0> is <T_5> , <T_4> i think we owe <T_2> to <T_7> as well as <T_3> disabuse <T_1> of that last image <T_6>
<T_0> of <T_1> species <T_3> , evolved <T_2> became extinct .
<T_1> don &apos;t want to <T_3> americans , god forbid , <T_2> they have to change <T_0> lifestyle .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> picture i took <T_4> tuesday -- less <T_5> a <T_3> ago -- <T_6> i ride with them <T_2> also .
we need <T_0> to work together <T_1> never <T_2> .
<T_3> that stuff , you <T_1> , <T_0> going to it the <T_2> way .
<T_9> thing that <T_0> amazes me <T_4> that , today , <T_1> spend about <T_3> billion <T_7> dollars <T_5> year <T_8> virtual <T_6> that only exist <T_2> video games .
<T_2> is the accumulation <T_1> biona <T_0> next to <T_3> l.a. <T_4> .
ok .
i <T_0> that <T_3> &apos;s still <T_1> my <T_2> .
and <T_1> i got <T_3> , <T_0> was perfect -- except <T_2> tail .
<T_0> are <T_1> issues .
so what <T_3> , okay , you take <T_4> role change , <T_5> happens <T_1> you do that <T_2> a really minimal <T_8> , <T_0> this tiny manipulation , <T_6> tiny <T_7> ?
you <T_2> to be able to open it up , crack <T_1> open , look at <T_3> wiring <T_0> .

the <T_2> wisdom <T_5> economics <T_3> the <T_7> in <T_0> has <T_6> been that actually , there &apos;s <T_8> tradeoff <T_4> social performance and <T_1> performance .
because <T_0> answers may <T_1> .
<T_1> me , <T_5> world is veering <T_0> a <T_3> we don &apos;t much want when <T_4> really think <T_2> it deep <T_6> .

&quot; what is <T_0> dying for ? &quot;
i <T_4> during <T_0> recovery the <T_3> leading <T_2> of death amongst <T_1> is suicide .
i have <T_2> to how <T_1> are actually going to <T_0> a device .
just <T_2> year <T_1> redesigning this <T_0> in <T_5> , <T_4> name it the <T_3> &apos;s best-designed <T_6> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> necessarily something <T_0> didn &apos;t know <T_3> .
so amongst <T_3> &apos;s many impressive <T_0> , <T_2> is one of my <T_1> .
<T_3> way to <T_0> down the silos is <T_1> get inter-operability between <T_2> sites .
this is <T_1> by a text panel , it &apos;s designed <T_0> scroll form , in <T_3> i <T_2> the narrative at <T_4> .
and <T_2> want to live <T_5> day <T_1> the <T_4> of my life <T_0> way , swim or <T_3> swim .

it was <T_2> nine years <T_1> that <T_4> ababa was connected by <T_5> to <T_6> , <T_3> is 500 <T_0> away .
<T_1> knows what &apos;s going to happen <T_2> ? kind of <T_0> .
the <T_1> brain <T_4> still <T_3> . <T_2> still have <T_0> alligator brain .
<T_0> matters is <T_5> likely or <T_3> , <T_4> to each other , the <T_2> explanations <T_1> .
<T_2> , it &apos;s -- <T_3> think astrolabes <T_0> just remarkable <T_1> .
but <T_4> tribe and <T_1> urged her <T_3> to compete and <T_0> very much <T_2> it .
he <T_2> , &quot; well , <T_0> i <T_3> &apos;t do it <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> difference <T_1> thinking <T_0> doing .
<T_1> it &apos;s <T_2> that <T_0> .
why is this <T_1> ? why <T_0> confidence ?
<T_7> was there . she was peeling this palm frond apart , these little threads off of it , and she &apos;d roll the threads together and make little thicker threads , like strings , and <T_0> would weave the strings together , and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes <T_3> those three <T_6> , the materiality of the way the world works , of reality , kind of started to unravel in my mind , because <T_5> realized that <T_4> bag and <T_2> clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener , everything <T_9> have is made out of either a tree or a rock <T_8> something we dug out of the ground and did some process to , maybe a more <T_1> one , but still , everything was made that way .
<T_2> these were <T_0> grown from <T_3> . we &apos;re <T_1> everything .
<T_1> , <T_3> nancy said <T_2> , like <T_0> immerse oneself into it .
<T_1> can be thrown off <T_0> track .
<T_2> this <T_0> , there &apos;s a <T_1> experience .
<T_2> see <T_0> resistant it is to those very <T_1> .
<T_1> everybody <T_2> it <T_0> they don &apos;t care .
so i &apos;d dip my <T_1> in paint , and i just <T_3> the <T_7> , and i actually <T_0> so <T_2> that i <T_8> a joint <T_9> my <T_6> and it was stuck straight <T_4> a couple of <T_5> .
<T_2> on <T_0> offers us such <T_1> perfect <T_3> .
<T_6> extend <T_7> reach of <T_1> tribes by connecting <T_2> , not just <T_5> myself , so that my <T_9> is greater , <T_8> i <T_0> people who don &apos;t <T_4> each other to something greater <T_3> themselves .
<T_1> , <T_6> now believe that <T_0> is the <T_2> sighting of <T_4> new disease , <T_3> is <T_7> an epidemic <T_5> through tasmania .
<T_0> ramses the <T_3> , whose <T_2> is <T_1> , died of <T_4> .
<T_1> feel so good about <T_0> .
<T_3> china <T_2> emitting 0.6 , and <T_0> was emitting 0.32 <T_1> per <T_4> .
<T_2> we see these <T_4> structures -- <T_5> little <T_1> of <T_3> colors of <T_0> we call &quot; social hot <T_6> . &quot;
the health care <T_0> would like <T_1> protections for <T_2> .
<T_4> if you look , you &apos;ll see that <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> one <T_1> you can score <T_0> .
<T_2> gabriel : so <T_1> is <T_4> something that <T_0> happens on other <T_3> .
<T_5> arm <T_2> body <T_3> , <T_0> you get <T_4> feedback from vision , from <T_6> , from <T_1> and so on .
<T_5> also has <T_3> metabolism . now this <T_8> a <T_4> by <T_1> life can <T_9> from the <T_0> into building <T_7> so it can maintain <T_2> build <T_6> .
and they say , &quot; will you <T_0> it <T_1> my <T_2> ? &quot;
in <T_3> to <T_1> that , well , <T_0> don &apos;t know how <T_2> do that .
now when <T_2> &apos;re in an <T_3> scanner , you &apos;re <T_5> a <T_4> magnet that &apos;s aligning your <T_0> in certain <T_1> .
because the whole <T_3> of this <T_2> is to see <T_1> well <T_0> understand <T_4> .
i <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s like a <T_2> . &quot;
<T_4> we cannot use smart <T_2> , <T_3> we &apos;d <T_0> use your very <T_1> cells .
<T_3> is it <T_1> to do <T_0> without a <T_2> ?
and you &apos;ll <T_4> i started <T_0> gum because <T_3> was around <T_2> camel <T_1> day .
most of the <T_3> doubted <T_2> possibility of that , and <T_1> , &quot; <T_0> you <T_4> ?
or to <T_0> the <T_4> term <T_2> it , there &apos;s <T_3> born <T_1> minute .
icebergs , many , many , many , many times the <T_1> of <T_0> building , are <T_2> out to <T_3> .
<T_1> read <T_0> gardner &apos;s columns in <T_2> american .
and <T_2> , &quot; <T_1> &apos;m <T_0> embarrassed .
<T_2> some reason it <T_3> , and <T_1> begin <T_0> get these <T_4> .
i actually <T_4> them a lot more <T_1> -- -- <T_9> personal , and <T_0> neat thing <T_3> a slide projector <T_6> you <T_7> actually focus <T_5> work , unlike <T_8> and some <T_2> programs .
through generous support <T_6> partnership <T_0> with google.org <T_3> the <T_1> foundation , we were able to <T_8> the global <T_9> forecasting initiative <T_7> begin <T_5> in <T_4> different sites in africa and <T_2> .
i <T_3> find an <T_4> where <T_0> can go back very <T_2> without <T_1> experience .
<T_4> let &apos;s <T_1> it , <T_3> , we <T_0> to reinvent <T_2> .
if <T_0> really <T_4> to see the kind of <T_7> behavior change <T_8> we &apos;re all talking about <T_2> environmentalists and <T_3> , maybe we <T_9> need to ditch <T_1> term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the <T_5> who are <T_6> stuff .
<T_0> had <T_1> low-tech <T_2> .
what <T_5> want <T_0> do this morning is share with you <T_1> couple of <T_3> and talk <T_4> a different <T_2> .
well , <T_1> not . it would be <T_4> if <T_9> were to engage <T_5> in the kind of operations we were engaged in , in <T_8> and afghanistan <T_7> to <T_2> find ourselves in a situation <T_3> which we were imposing anything other <T_0> a democratic <T_6> .
you know , so i could turn to <T_9> much any sage from shakespeare to <T_6> colbert to point <T_5> things <T_7> the fact <T_4> we &apos;re noble in reason and infinite in <T_1> and just kind of awesome-er <T_8> anything <T_2> on the planet when <T_3> comes to all things <T_0> .
and <T_1> said that <T_0> are only <T_2> if they <T_3> themselves <T_4> be .
<T_5> example , <T_3> have an <T_4> system where the <T_0> who <T_7> 20,000 miles a <T_1> pays the <T_6> insurance <T_2> somebody <T_8> drives 3,000 .
jacqueline <T_2> applauds the <T_0> &apos;s heightened <T_4> in <T_5> and poverty , but <T_6> persuasively <T_1> a <T_3> approach .
i mean , why <T_2> you <T_3> to refrigerate <T_0> whole <T_1> ?
<T_4> have a very <T_2> and <T_9> partnership <T_7> our colleagues <T_6> the institute for <T_0> research in <T_3> us <T_5> , who have to <T_1> the now 11,000 kids that have come back from <T_8> .
<T_3> a <T_1> of the <T_2> that <T_4> available in their <T_0> .
it was <T_3> -- it was <T_4> &quot; <T_1> air pump , &quot; or <T_2> like &quot; the <T_5> and <T_0> air pump . &quot;
actually , <T_4> found <T_0> percent is easier <T_3> do <T_1> 90 percent or <T_2> percent .
<T_1> , i was born <T_0> days <T_2> christmas .
i would <T_5> here is <T_8> religious <T_2> come <T_6> , <T_0> religious leaders <T_3> good <T_1> reframing issues for people , at harnessing the emotional <T_4> of the brain to get people to <T_9> their awareness and <T_7> the way they think .
<T_2> chaos is , like <T_4> of netflix <T_3> , <T_1> to do the same <T_0> .
<T_0> is <T_1> femtosecond laser lab .
<T_0> means we &apos;re <T_2> them from <T_1> .
of course <T_6> is somewhat <T_8> , and you know , about 55 <T_9> years ago there was this <T_1> little puffer fish faction that said , <T_2> , the <T_4> with the coral <T_7> -- <T_5> &apos;re going to head <T_3> the high <T_0> .
so it <T_3> acceleration , <T_2> acceleration -- <T_4> a human <T_1> , <T_0> ear .
<T_0> what <T_1> you do ?
<T_5> have a <T_6> , <T_4> outbreak of disease in <T_3> united <T_0> , we <T_1> not prepared <T_2> cope with it .
<T_2> as you can <T_6> , <T_9> pigeon , or <T_8> chicken <T_0> anything else , <T_4> bird , has <T_7> of a weird-looking <T_3> , <T_5> the hand is <T_1> wing .
and it <T_5> them from <T_8> those <T_1> , <T_2> mitotic <T_4> , that are <T_0> to pull <T_7> genetic <T_6> into the daughter <T_3> .
because <T_2> &apos;m <T_4> now than <T_1> burns <T_0> when he <T_3> , &quot; at <T_7> age , i don &apos;t even <T_6> green <T_5> . &quot;
you <T_1> do <T_0> about that too .
<T_6> that , <T_7> married <T_2> managers , two-thirds of <T_4> married <T_1> had children and <T_3> one-third of <T_5> married <T_0> had children .
<T_0> course , he &apos;d get really <T_1> .
and <T_2> just want to <T_0> you <T_4> i &apos;m not <T_1> preaching , but i <T_3> practice .
and he suddenly <T_2> he &apos;s been <T_4> by the <T_5> , <T_0> it &apos;s <T_3> to let <T_1> .
<T_6> actually said <T_0> one of the <T_2> you see in <T_1> spectra is <T_4> alien . <T_5> comes from <T_3> different <T_7> .
and <T_0> promise to you , <T_5> was such <T_6> important moment <T_1> my career , <T_9> i <T_2> that the <T_4> leader <T_8> in young <T_3> and <T_7> ideas .
<T_1> , you can share <T_0> your friends <T_2>
rl : so , what i did is <T_1> i had another screening room experience where <T_9> was basically tracking where i was looking , or where we were looking , <T_8> of course you &apos;re looking at the two people on the bow of the ship , and then at some point , i &apos;m changing the periphery of the shot , i &apos;m changing , it &apos;s becoming the rusted <T_5> , and then i would run it every day , and <T_6> i would find exactly <T_2> moment <T_0> i stopped looking <T_7> them <T_3> start noticing the rest of it , and the moment my <T_4> shifted , we just marked it to the frame .
<T_3> i <T_1> &apos;t feel <T_2> i &apos;m <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> more .
<T_0> , <T_3> &apos;m here to <T_1> vaccines <T_2> you .
<T_1> said , &quot; <T_0> . <T_3> do <T_2> do ? &quot;
<T_8> willie brown <T_9> , &quot; <T_1> sure as <T_0> &apos;m the mayor <T_5> san <T_6> , i &apos;m going to build this thing <T_3> a legacy <T_2> the poor people <T_7> this <T_4> . &quot;
<T_0> could call <T_1> &quot; <T_2> perfumator . &quot;
<T_1> does <T_0> work ?
<T_0> you very much .
<T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> going on there .
<T_0> if somebody answers , that <T_1> be my <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> wish <T_3> &apos;d taken <T_0> advantage <T_1> the education that we did have .
<T_0> now we , with a bird &apos;s eye view looking <T_1> this <T_4> , can <T_3> that they occupy <T_2> different <T_5> worlds .

<T_7> i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand <T_8> what <T_0> have the privilege to <T_2> is <T_6> same <T_9> , <T_1> same process in a small-scale version <T_4> helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun <T_5> even <T_3> very planet .
we <T_0> the <T_6> world war , <T_3> great depression , <T_4> second world war <T_5> the <T_2> of the <T_1> nations .
i <T_1> , &quot; you <T_2> actually <T_0> this . &quot;
so <T_1> is <T_2> program , embarrassingly <T_3> , <T_0> as we &apos;re going to <T_5> , <T_4> powerful .
i <T_0> , we &apos;re not <T_1> this one back .
<T_1> i <T_0> more .
br : <T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_1> of those happened <T_0> ?
and <T_0> &apos;s happened now <T_1> a number of <T_2> .
<T_7> had <T_5> scoliosis and therefore <T_3> have been looked after quite <T_8> by <T_9> female , and probably <T_1> smaller , members of <T_0> family <T_2> , <T_6> have got to where he did in life , age <T_4> .
we <T_0> did .
<T_0> also can <T_2> adjuvants , <T_3> are <T_1> you mix .
you <T_1> , actually , <T_0> none of <T_3> things have mattered <T_2> much .
thanks .
<T_1> &apos;ve been <T_2> text messages back <T_0> these .
<T_4> lost a <T_2> when i was <T_3> , <T_0> second child when i was <T_1> .
<T_1> you increase , maintain <T_0> decrease <T_2> number of fluids ? &quot;
founding <T_0> all had slaves . sweeney : i know .
<T_5> &apos;ve <T_0> a quest <T_4> begins in the world of the very small , and propels <T_3> to <T_1> world of the far <T_2> .
<T_0> -- <T_1> &apos;s the thing .
one of <T_3> most cherished dreams <T_1> to cheat <T_0> by that practice <T_2> as <T_4> .
<T_1> those <T_4> , it turns <T_2> , are <T_6> powerful , and <T_3> people who can <T_7> them will be <T_0> , very successful <T_5>
and <T_4> &apos;m just going to give <T_3> images <T_0> of a <T_2> of company research <T_1> .
here is <T_2> thing , <T_0> , <T_4> cannot <T_1> come from <T_3> source .
one image that has <T_8> me <T_7> my early <T_3> days <T_0> of <T_1> grandmother , 70 <T_4> years , being harassed <T_5> the <T_2> in <T_6> town planning office .
they &apos;ve got <T_5> gene infected <T_2> them as well , <T_1> they want <T_0> to <T_6> , <T_4> than <T_3> else .
<T_2> germany , we <T_0> pushing <T_3> ratification of the un convention , <T_1> is a subsequent convention .
<T_3> : well <T_1> now i &apos;m in college at <T_0> university of <T_2> .
ad <T_5> decided to put <T_1> to the test <T_4> actually <T_0> inoculating <T_3> with cancer from somebody <T_2> .
<T_1> is also <T_0> medicine .
do <T_1> really believe <T_4> engineering and <T_0> and <T_3> of these other things <T_2> have so benefited <T_7> computers and <T_5> have somehow <T_6> gotten <T_8> by using <T_9> ?
but <T_5> to challenge <T_1> notion of suspension of disbelief such that <T_6> the last act <T_3> macbeth , if he or she <T_7> you to <T_4> the parable that <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> with <T_8> , with your real <T_9> , he or she can do so .
gets it <T_1> , <T_0> press a <T_3> on the shock <T_2> .
i <T_2> , <T_0> christians , <T_5> &apos;re <T_6> . <T_1> would they do this to <T_4> little <T_3> ? &quot;
<T_4> are <T_5> cleaner , dramatically <T_2> , more <T_3> and <T_0> more affordable than <T_1> were <T_6> years ago .
<T_3> they &apos;re -- they &apos;re just as <T_1> on that screen <T_2> they were <T_0> person .
halla <T_0> : <T_2> feminine <T_1> to iceland &apos;s financial crash

thank you .
these were being <T_4> for <T_0> 2,000 dollars <T_7> , and <T_6> are used <T_8> bear paw <T_2> , and also being trained , <T_1> on , to <T_5> dancing bears like <T_3> one <T_9> just saw .
<T_2> of all , <T_1> little bit of <T_0> .
einstein : <T_1> , <T_2> , <T_0> , ooh .
and <T_9> my <T_5> and <T_7> , it &apos;s been just a <T_1> experience <T_3> we have <T_4> to do interesting <T_6> , while at the <T_0> time helping the many <T_8> that <T_2> have worked with .
<T_2> depends on <T_1> taking the <T_0> side .
and some of <T_1> most heartrending emails that <T_0> get on <T_9> website <T_5> actually from adolescents hovering on the <T_3> of <T_8> , <T_6> with me <T_7> write to their parents , <T_4> help them slow down , to help <T_2> get off this full-throttle treadmill .
what that will do <T_4> avoid the problem i was talking about <T_5> , <T_8> currently we have political <T_6> presenting <T_9> as merely <T_7> political <T_3> in those <T_1> alongside other choices such <T_2> military rule and <T_0> .
<T_1> blue whale , it &apos;s <T_5> dwarf if compared <T_6> the <T_2> biggest <T_3> that <T_0> on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequoiadendron <T_4> .
as a <T_0> of that <T_3> higher <T_4> is simply <T_1> keeping <T_2> with india &apos;s demands .
so what <T_1> we started using <T_0> five senses theory in <T_3> of our <T_2> ?
it turns out it &apos;s <T_1> the <T_0> standard <T_2> too low .
<T_3> is a <T_0> filled <T_5> a half atmospheres <T_2> atmospheric pressure , with a <T_4> and with <T_1> bright light . <T_6>
&quot; <T_5> &apos;m <T_0> genius , therefore <T_4> got <T_7> a , <T_1> i &apos;ll <T_6> an a <T_2> and again <T_3> the future . &quot;
so <T_6> move this <T_7> very <T_0> -- <T_2> kilometers outside -- and we <T_4> it &apos;s perfectly <T_5> orbiting around <T_1> black <T_3> .
<T_4> they did <T_2> back . what <T_1> couldn &apos;t <T_0> was that <T_3> things would happen .
that <T_1> is already <T_0> if you &apos;re a <T_2> .
<T_4> then in the end , what i <T_7> was <T_0> time <T_9> finish <T_1> the <T_8> , i would <T_6> and i would give <T_3> card to <T_2> on the side of the <T_5> .
<T_1> were couch potatoes <T_2> that was the only <T_0> given to us .
these <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_0> wing motor is <T_1> resilient .
now , so , our <T_1> study is just <T_2> . <T_0> got three <T_3> dollars .
this <T_1> for a <T_0> by &quot; metropolis . &quot;
<T_1> communicate <T_0> other plants .
<T_3> of your <T_0> regrets <T_4> also <T_1> as ugly <T_2> you think they are .
<T_2> in a <T_0> neighborhood <T_1> people have <T_3> given up for dead .
<T_8> you translate <T_0> to <T_9> building <T_3> , if <T_6> have a <T_4> of windowpanes <T_5> one <T_1> is <T_2> , we go , &quot; oh , dear . <T_7> &apos;s cracked . let &apos;s repair it .
imagine <T_4> &apos;re <T_6> the <T_2> and you <T_1> a captcha <T_5> you think is somewhat <T_3> , like <T_0> captcha .
<T_2> can <T_0> to watch <T_3> &quot; <T_4> &quot; <T_1> whatever .
<T_3> something <T_0> that . <T_2> just <T_1> that up .
most of <T_4> photos are set <T_2> places that have been <T_0> for decades , <T_5> this <T_1> an <T_3> .
<T_7> what we <T_4> is we took <T_5> moment in time from <T_3> recordings <T_0> asked , what was <T_2> retina seeing <T_6> that <T_1> ?
outside.in &apos;s steven johnson says the web <T_7> like <T_8> city : <T_5> by <T_9> people , completely controlled by no one , <T_6> interconnected and <T_4> functioning <T_0> many independent parts . <T_2> disaster <T_1> in one place , <T_3> , life goes on .
<T_3> that <T_1> have unlimited access <T_0> music , what does <T_2> with us ?
<T_1> makes them <T_0> ?
<T_2> we see it in <T_0> and <T_1> right now .
but <T_1> the <T_0> , there &apos;s complex <T_2> .
so in this way , by <T_7> this kind of <T_8> , <T_5> can draw cause and effect relationships <T_4> the <T_0> of specific <T_1> in particular <T_2> and particular behaviors , something <T_9> is extremely <T_3> , if <T_6> impossible , to do right now in humans .
more recently , because the cost of <T_5> groups communicate with each other has <T_1> through the floor -- and communication costs <T_3> one of the <T_4> inputs <T_8> coordination -- there has been a second answer , which is to put the <T_0> into <T_2> infrastructure , to design systems that coordinate the <T_9> of the group <T_6> a by-product of the operating of the <T_7> , without regard to institutional models .
because <T_2> are all <T_0> on these <T_1> .
so now people <T_2> say , &quot; <T_1> want <T_3> this <T_0> this <T_5> this , &quot; <T_6> you <T_4> go out and <T_7> it .
we <T_0> out of <T_1> two times .
or <T_3> really , <T_2> fine <T_0> with <T_1> .
so what is <T_0> doing ? they &apos;re asking you and me , using online policy wikis , to <T_4> not simply get <T_8> of burdensome regulations that impede <T_2> , but to replace those regulations with <T_5> innovative <T_9> , <T_6> using transparency <T_1> the creation of new iphone apps that will allows <T_3> both to protect <T_7> and the public and to encourage economic development .
it <T_4> no meaning , <T_3> -- <T_1> discovers the <T_6> , and <T_5> &apos;s <T_0> desoto <T_2> the mississippi .
so on the morning i visited , eleanor came downstairs , poured herself a cup of coffee , sat <T_0> a reclining chair , and she sat there , kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs , checked <T_5> list , <T_9> themselves breakfast , checked the <T_8> again , put the dishes in <T_6> dishwasher , <T_7> the list , fed <T_4> pets <T_2> whatever chores they had , checked the <T_1> once more , gathered their belongings , and made their <T_3> to the bus .
<T_1> somehow , if <T_4> use a <T_6> , it &apos;s all <T_7> button-pushing , <T_0> if you do <T_3> by <T_5> , it &apos;s all <T_2> .
the <T_3> starts <T_2> mathematics , it <T_1> with <T_0> .
they &apos;d sit <T_0> ; i &apos;d <T_1> out of <T_2> house .
<T_4> the <T_3> york <T_0> &apos; and vanity <T_5> &apos;s best efforts <T_2> , they &apos;re not <T_1> .
<T_1> made <T_2> compulsory for <T_3> to <T_0> the veil .
so <T_0> first way that we did <T_1> .
and <T_2> most complex <T_1> are <T_4> , midway <T_0> atoms <T_3> stars .
<T_4> can work within the rules ; we <T_1> &apos;t <T_3> the rules ; we &apos;re <T_0> learning <T_2> the rules are .
<T_0> , <T_2> by <T_6> we <T_4> to build a <T_3> that can <T_5> a <T_1> cliff environment .
<T_3> she serves it that <T_6> time <T_4> time again , <T_9> if you <T_5> with her , she will <T_0> , &quot; you <T_7> what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this <T_2> the best way <T_1> ought <T_8> be in this restaurant . &quot;
for <T_0> years , after <T_4> up the <T_1> on <T_3> one -- inauguration day with <T_2> in the military -- which was <T_5> .
for <T_0> 100 <T_2> in special education , <T_1> are 217 <T_3> .
<T_4> fell <T_2> love with penguins , <T_3> it <T_5> has <T_0> the rest of <T_1> life .
<T_0> materials that can <T_5> water , <T_1> materials that can <T_2> fuel cells work <T_8> , <T_7> materials that catalyze chemical <T_4> , <T_3> cut <T_6> and so on .
both <T_4> brother and sister <T_1> i , <T_0> three of <T_2> own <T_3> as well .
well , it &apos;s <T_3> to do that , so we <T_0> to create <T_5> technologies . <T_2> had to <T_1> step inside <T_4> body .
rs : <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> of the <T_1> hopes .
we <T_5> , we got some <T_9> , <T_4> put &quot; incredible <T_0> &quot; <T_6> the <T_1> , we gave it every market <T_2> that was selling locally , <T_7> they <T_3> on what <T_8> were selling in any one week .
<T_3> the other <T_1> of life that is <T_2> mastered is <T_4> art <T_0> fulfillment .
<T_1> had come <T_0> remorse .
and <T_5> dug in <T_0> heels <T_3> said , &quot; no . <T_2> know <T_9> man <T_7> than <T_6> of <T_4> . <T_8> have met with him over <T_1> over again .
<T_0> look at <T_2> predictable this <T_1> .
<T_0> , <T_2> , <T_1> fate !
teachers who have been <T_0> science for <T_2> years , <T_1> just muck up <T_4> definition and they <T_3> it <T_5> .
<T_1> them , <T_2> headwaters is <T_0> kitchen .
<T_2> asked , <T_0> said , &quot; <T_4> &apos;s kind of <T_3> a <T_1> that doesn &apos;t flush . &quot;
<T_2> there is <T_0> of dollars being spent on <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;re <T_2> brothers from new <T_4> , <T_8> the funny thing <T_7> that , believe it <T_5> not , we <T_9> hooked <T_1> bluegrass and we &apos;re <T_3> to play it for <T_6> tonight .
we <T_6> a study , a scientifically designed process , and then , <T_4> our dismay , we <T_5> this was only <T_2> seven percent of those <T_7> need , <T_3> we &apos;re not <T_0> addressing more , bigger <T_1> .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_5> : we &apos;re not <T_1> bright . <T_8> &apos;re <T_6> on wisdom ; <T_2> &apos;re high on <T_4> . <T_7> &apos;s it going to <T_3> ?
beau lotto &apos;s <T_6> your vision , <T_9> they <T_5> spotlight what <T_1> can &apos;t <T_4> see : how your <T_0> works . this fun , first-hand look at <T_8> own versatile sense of <T_2> reveals how evolution tints <T_7> <T_3> what &apos;s really out there .
it says , &quot; <T_2> : <T_0> poem is <T_1> .
because , if you can envision , as <T_8> do , a <T_6> of zero <T_0> and <T_7> to move around the <T_2> and around the world like <T_3> take for granted today , that &apos;s worth <T_1> hard <T_4> today to <T_5> that for <T_9> .
but <T_1> again , <T_8> you look at that <T_3> of child well-being , in relation <T_6> national income <T_4> person , <T_2> &apos;s no <T_0> , no <T_7> of a <T_5> .
and part <T_0> what mission <T_2> is about is <T_1> , &quot; <T_3> ! &quot;
and <T_2> nail <T_0> a 19th- and <T_1> industrial-era model of success .
but <T_0> &apos;s be <T_1> .
i <T_0> to <T_2> what <T_1> was saying .
<T_2> &apos;ll never <T_1> indian women so <T_0> .
so this <T_2> very much like choosing the <T_0> station <T_1> the radio dial .
<T_0> not <T_4> recorded history ; <T_1> helped change the <T_3> of <T_2> .
<T_0> it <T_2> &apos;t mean it &apos;s going <T_1> work forever .
now <T_2> americans in the audience will <T_1> all <T_0> cup <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;re going to have <T_1> personal <T_0> .
that &apos;s <T_7> we &apos;re still trying to find <T_0> to , <T_8> it is <T_4> to realize that <T_1> is diversity <T_9> all different <T_6> , <T_3> our <T_5> are no <T_2> .
this <T_8> group <T_5> women , determined to bring an end to the <T_6> , and <T_4> chose to <T_2> their <T_0> to make a point : <T_3> women <T_9> wear lots <T_1> jewelry <T_7> colorful clothing .
look <T_0> the kind of <T_1> that &apos;s available .
<T_1> has a <T_0> for a robotic <T_2> blood cell .
<T_0> still <T_2> understand what <T_1> scientists are <T_3> about .
<T_2> characters also drank a <T_3> of ginger beer <T_1> the <T_6> in <T_4> british <T_5> i <T_0> drank ginger beer .
i <T_0> bathed . i sometimes didn &apos;t shave . <T_1> was <T_2> .
followed by that , you see on <T_0> west <T_1> planes <T_3> across , <T_2> red-eye <T_4> to the <T_5> .
<T_0> done <T_1> the lab .
so <T_3> and managers <T_0> two major problems in <T_1> today , <T_4> to <T_2> .
it &apos;s <T_0> easy , <T_1> it &apos;s <T_2> .
all <T_0> , <T_3> &apos;m going to <T_4> you one <T_2> story about <T_1> building .
everybody <T_0> about carbon taxes -- it <T_4> &apos;t work -- emission schemes , but <T_1> example , one policy <T_2> , feed-in tariffs on the energy system , which is <T_6> applied , <T_9> china doing <T_3> on <T_7> wind <T_5> , all the way <T_8> the u.s .
for a <T_4> , one <T_8> to <T_5> different sources <T_3> facts and data , <T_6> we built quite a pipeline of <T_7> automation <T_1> human domain experts for doing this .
so fishermen <T_1> only <T_0> what <T_2> could either <T_4> or <T_3> that day .
<T_0> 2008 , <T_3> a has surpassed <T_2> b with $ <T_4> per capita gdp as <T_1> with $ 650 per capita gdp .
<T_4> the <T_3> to that is <T_2> philosophy that <T_5> call <T_1> markets for <T_0> .
<T_0> shortly <T_2> , we left <T_4> country , and we <T_3> to <T_1> .
<T_3> they &apos;re <T_1> , they &apos;re your <T_0> . <T_2> from it .
so i prepared for <T_0> like <T_3> as <T_2> i <T_1> .
<T_1> boldly , <T_5> , <T_0> pugnaciously , <T_3> even , when <T_4> bottle <T_2> empty .
<T_5> what makes <T_3> even worse <T_9> that <T_4> &apos;s just the <T_1> , <T_6> once <T_8> &apos;ve collected all that data , of <T_7> someone &apos;s going to have to -- some <T_0> person is going to have to type that into <T_2> computer .
<T_0> he <T_2> there <T_1> tried to <T_3> him , of course .
<T_2> then <T_0> thought -- <T_1> here &apos;s the <T_3> .
<T_1> they actually come out <T_0> of nice <T_2> .
and i was there . <T_6> showed up <T_2> two <T_5> and <T_0> -- <T_4> tell <T_3> story because <T_7> really <T_1> me .
<T_2> about <T_1> ? how about <T_3> create a <T_0> world for nothing ?
there &apos;s armenian , <T_0> , <T_3> , <T_1> , <T_2> .
growth is <T_1> , <T_0> reform .
this <T_1> comes after <T_0> with <T_2> rifle .
and you can <T_4> moral <T_2> off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not treating <T_3> principles <T_0> concrete <T_1> .
so , there <T_0> were .
the universal <T_4> was &quot; <T_0> , <T_5> want a <T_3> job than that <T_1> my <T_2> . &quot;
<T_4> from <T_6> stick figure , i <T_5> have to get to a folded <T_8> that has a <T_0> for <T_1> bit of the <T_3> , <T_7> flap for every <T_2> .
getting <T_1> commodities to <T_0> .
<T_0> we <T_2> to have signposts gathering <T_5> together <T_3> pointing them -- something <T_4> the happy <T_1> index .
i want you all to <T_4> one of the houses <T_1> the <T_2> houses you see <T_0> the <T_3> .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_1> fair for me ; <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> fair for <T_3> country .
<T_0> you very much .
<T_0> brown building <T_5> the one you <T_1> have been looking at <T_3> i &apos;ll <T_6> you where <T_4> made my <T_2> mistake .
<T_0> decide what <T_1> do .
<T_4> of all , <T_3> , we <T_0> to get better <T_1> telling <T_2> stories .
so when these <T_0> million people , <T_5> , even <T_2> block the <T_4> in <T_1> censored <T_3> .
<T_5> in <T_0> last <T_2> or <T_3> years , we &apos;re finding dead <T_1> popping up all <T_4> the place .
<T_5> cope with this <T_3> by having <T_4> , <T_6> within <T_1> brains , decision-making centers <T_7> i &apos;ve called <T_2> the &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
<T_0> you <T_2> go <T_3> hopping , who do you <T_1> to take with you ?
and if <T_5> take this program out , and give it to your <T_2> , they <T_3> such a <T_0> opportunity to go out <T_1> do good , <T_7> they &apos;ve got <T_4> like <T_6> .

<T_1> is <T_0> legitimate , <T_8> use of the <T_6> that has contributed greatly <T_2> the <T_5> of <T_7> , conflict and <T_3> around the <T_4> .
then we <T_1> start to use <T_0> .
<T_1> : for you <T_0> for them ?
<T_0> it &apos;s <T_1> , i plan to integrate the <T_5> mushrooms <T_2> a <T_4> of <T_3> .
<T_7> mean , <T_1> have the <T_3> european <T_4> , <T_0> a dense <T_5> core , good public transportation <T_6> , not a lot of road <T_2> .
<T_4> &apos;s a <T_3> like a <T_2> scanner in a <T_1> . <T_0> .
and i &apos;m <T_3> by this because <T_2> &apos;ve been <T_1> gay now <T_0> quite some time .
that <T_3> 10 times <T_0> than the <T_1> radiation , which was a four-legged <T_2> .
they look <T_1> they &apos;ve been pulled <T_0> .
louise <T_0> talked yesterday <T_4> how we &apos;re the <T_1> one <T_2> this <T_3> left .
only <T_1> percent is passenger <T_2> , interestingly <T_0> .
artists <T_9> take us <T_8> a far-flung part of the city <T_6> we <T_3> &apos;t <T_1> , <T_2> they can take <T_7> into that building <T_5> we pass every day <T_4> we <T_0> went into .
and the reason i <T_5> cheating is because <T_4> &apos;s interesting , but <T_3> it <T_1> us something , i <T_6> , about <T_0> stock market <T_2> we &apos;re in .
they <T_1> their <T_6> , <T_5> and <T_3> minutes , and it <T_0> significantly change the <T_2> of their <T_4> .
what , <T_1> this kind of <T_0> ? they don &apos;t <T_2> it .
<T_0> guessed <T_2> : <T_1> peace .
they <T_1> for no <T_0> .
<T_1> wanted <T_6> who worked <T_4> , because <T_5> for me is extremely <T_3> , but <T_2> too <T_0> .
so , this <T_2> , <T_0> don &apos;t know if <T_1> can <T_3> this .
and <T_4> tends <T_3> feel a little overwhelming <T_7> we look at <T_6> is there in <T_5> today and <T_1> magnitude of the <T_0> that <T_2> face .
and <T_2> just -- <T_3> love <T_1> guys . i <T_0> ted .
and reaching <T_0> , i always <T_1> what <T_2> loved .
and <T_2> then went on <T_4> even <T_3> risk to get <T_1> never-before-made photograph of <T_0> trawl net scraping <T_5> ocean bottom .
<T_0> founded the <T_1> movement .
so then i can add some color <T_3> with the <T_6> and <T_4> a bit more color in with <T_2> words themselves , and this way , working with the art director , i &apos;m able to bring <T_7> to just the right point that it &apos;s puzzling <T_0> the <T_8> -- <T_5> can figure out that there &apos;s something they have to read -- <T_9> it &apos;s not <T_1> for them to read .
<T_0> larvae <T_2> to develop very <T_1> .
<T_1> , <T_5> know from <T_3> that we <T_2> really now predict what &apos;s going to happen <T_0> our <T_4> planet .
<T_1> &apos;s our <T_0> to overestimate our likelihood of <T_6> good <T_2> in <T_5> lives <T_3> underestimate our <T_7> of experiencing bad <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;m going to distinguish between what i <T_3> front half <T_2> back <T_0> .
<T_4> , <T_2> much for <T_1> . <T_3> about <T_0> ?
i don &apos;t know anybody .
<T_4> of the <T_5> of <T_7> knowledge , <T_1> of the <T_6> revolution , i have <T_0> voice , and <T_2> do not need to <T_3> .
the point <T_1> there are <T_2> these <T_0> ideas out <T_3> .
well , <T_2> year later <T_3> returned , and using the <T_8> protocols and recording <T_4> the <T_7> conditions , i <T_1> a <T_9> of examples <T_0> the same <T_6> choruses , and now this is <T_5> we &apos;ve got .
<T_2> &apos;m <T_1> organic food-eating , carbon footprint-minimizing , robotic <T_0> geek .
people can make <T_0> own <T_2> from waste <T_1> .
it <T_2> unequivocally <T_0> something a <T_1> could <T_3> on .
here we go .
and <T_1> you can get into the point where <T_0> &apos;s so <T_3> you &apos;re going <T_2> have a person that &apos;s going to be non-verbal .
now <T_0> me <T_4> you a little bit about <T_2> dengue fever <T_1> , <T_3> those who don &apos;t <T_5> .
i <T_3> that <T_2> very , <T_7> thought <T_0> , <T_6> that &apos;s why i <T_4> to bring it <T_1> for <T_5> guys to see .
<T_4> restaurant looks a <T_2> bit like acorn <T_3> -- <T_0> chairs , same <T_1> .
perfect <T_1> of that <T_0> patagonia .
<T_3> &apos;s a starry <T_0> in <T_2> , i <T_1> .
and <T_5> , we &apos;re <T_4> about <T_1> planes <T_6> existence , sort of <T_3> a book jacket <T_0> the book <T_7> it <T_2> .
<T_0> said , &quot; <T_1> . &quot;
this is <T_3> very un-pc <T_2> . <T_1> in <T_0> york .
<T_0> &apos;re <T_2> left alone with your own <T_1> .
<T_2> this <T_1> &apos;t <T_0> a problem in britain .
in <T_3> , there are <T_2> of children <T_0> because of <T_1> health extension worker program .
so <T_9> want <T_6> see a completely <T_8> , <T_7> math <T_4> built from the <T_2> up , <T_5> on computers <T_3> there , <T_0> that are now <T_1> almost .
<T_0> top economists are <T_2> on this <T_1> .
well <T_0> this is <T_1> replica .
now , by the <T_0> you are doing that and <T_3> greatly the <T_6> of <T_7> ground <T_1> more than <T_2> the world &apos;s land , <T_5> are changing <T_4> .
<T_5> &apos;s my <T_4> . <T_2> in <T_3> , <T_1> problem isn &apos;t how to make <T_0> world more technological .
but <T_1> bigger issue <T_5> that global <T_6> is going to stifle <T_0> and our <T_4> to <T_3> food and health <T_7> , particularly <T_8> people that live in city <T_2> .
but this <T_1> a <T_4> -- <T_3> is a great <T_2> ; it <T_0> beautiful .
and <T_0> , it &apos;s really been <T_1> by alexa <T_3> , <T_5> donates this <T_4> to the internet <T_2> .
what he did was he looked at <T_7> companies that <T_4> an r &amp; amp ; d center in <T_0> and in india , and then he looked at <T_9> patent that <T_2> filed out of the u.s. and <T_5> similar patent filed out of the same company &apos;s subsidiary in india , so he &apos;s now comparing the patents of r &amp; amp ; d centers in the u.s. with r &amp; amp ; d centers in india of the same company <T_8> find out what is the quality of the patents filed <T_3> of the indian centers and how do they compare <T_1> the quality of the patents filed <T_6> of the u.s. centers ?
<T_2> we run <T_0> , <T_1> ?
<T_0> one thing we should all understand <T_2> that <T_4> are brutally honest <T_1> search <T_3> .
so <T_0> , i grab -- you <T_1> this ? five of clubs ...
<T_1> we <T_5> to use those <T_2> to create <T_0> pull , and <T_3> the <T_4> .
<T_5> you look at most <T_0> , <T_1> you look at is <T_4> building , the <T_2> , and <T_3> is <T_6> building .
<T_2> , <T_0> is game <T_1> about ?
<T_1> &apos;s really just in <T_5> with -- <T_3> &apos;s at one <T_4> -- <T_0> &apos;s <T_2> goose whisperer .
&quot; you <T_0> to <T_3> . <T_2> come you &apos;re <T_1> happy ? &quot;
<T_4> i won &apos;t , <T_2> i &apos;m <T_3> years old . <T_1> is <T_6> eightieth <T_7> , and i <T_0> that <T_8> time is <T_5> .
second , <T_3> &apos;s a <T_2> of not <T_8> his <T_7> ; it &apos;s a <T_1> of his <T_4> , because all of <T_0> assets are <T_5> up in <T_6> .
or <T_0> some of the <T_1> objects launched <T_4> the <T_3> spawn <T_5> oases , a post-human <T_2> elsewhere ?
and <T_1> my idea , heaven is <T_0> curiosity .
and <T_1> don &apos;t know <T_9> or <T_5> it happened , but <T_3> speed <T_8> which <T_7> went from <T_0> a talented writer <T_2> journalist to being a homeless <T_4> , living in a van , took my <T_6> away .
<T_0> tried <T_5> the water without any <T_4> or <T_1> just <T_2> see how it <T_3> .
<T_4> equally <T_0> is to <T_1> things that are <T_3> for <T_2> .
<T_0> majority <T_1> them <T_3> , first , <T_2> developing countries .
you <T_7> on the <T_5> , and <T_4> almost <T_3> years of having those <T_8> , <T_6> sound <T_1> kind of goes <T_2> it <T_0> .
in this , elvis is following <T_0> &apos;s <T_5> definition of <T_6> as the process of giving the <T_2> a <T_3> that belongs <T_1> something <T_4> .
that <T_2> an <T_4> ; that <T_3> an implication <T_1> the <T_0> &apos;s rise that <T_5> &apos;t obvious to everybody .
we all <T_1> the same <T_2> , believe <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s a big <T_1> .
on <T_1> 4 , 1957 , they <T_2> their <T_0> .
and <T_1> &apos;m trying to play <T_0> .
<T_0> this is hypothesis-generating .
<T_0> don &apos;t mean any <T_1> act .
all <T_0> , so <T_5> &apos;s go back <T_3> another bet <T_2> you made with <T_4> , i guess , a kind of <T_1> bet .
<T_0> you , <T_1> , for <T_2> great inspiration .
but <T_1> great <T_2> came , of course , with <T_0> and <T_3> .
and <T_1> they see that there are <T_4> here <T_3> the feeder tray , and they <T_2> up <T_0> help <T_5> .
but <T_0> , boy oh <T_1> , <T_2> exist .
<T_1> they &apos;re <T_0> into the city by <T_2> .
<T_0> don &apos;t have any <T_1> .
<T_2> issue <T_3> what happens <T_1> these <T_5> that actually indulge into playing video games <T_6> five <T_4> per <T_8> , 10 <T_0> per week , 15 <T_7> per week .
my <T_8> , as <T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> heard , <T_2> to tell <T_5> about statistics -- and , to be more <T_7> , <T_6> tell you <T_9> exciting <T_4> about <T_3> .
and <T_0> &apos;s scaling <T_1> cities .
and you <T_8> actually use it <T_5> our monkeys to either interact with them , <T_9> you <T_3> train them <T_1> assume <T_4> a virtual world the first-person perspective of that <T_2> and <T_7> her brain activity to <T_6> the movements of <T_0> avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
and that &apos;s exactly <T_1> the <T_0> are doing here .
and he <T_2> , &quot; <T_1> year , my mom passed away from <T_4> in sri lanka , <T_3> we couldn <T_8> afford proper <T_7> for her , &quot; and he said , &quot; this <T_0> is my <T_6> to <T_5> mom <T_9> &quot;
<T_9> , the <T_0> basis <T_2> neoclassical <T_6> would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject <T_3> dollar <T_1> someone <T_4> don &apos;t <T_5> in <T_8> room is going to get <T_7> .
obviously , one of the most <T_8> things <T_0> the <T_1> , and so <T_2> job was , well , <T_4> much <T_5> do everything , but it <T_6> about bringing the <T_7> back to <T_3> homestead .
<T_1> people who <T_2> basically outside <T_4> being really <T_0> , <T_3> for the one <T_6> who was <T_5> debilitating disease .
so sorry . &quot;
showing a <T_0> of inspiring , unusual <T_2> playful products , british branding <T_5> design guru <T_9> bennett <T_7> that design doesn &apos;t have to be about <T_4> gestures , <T_3> can solve <T_6> , universal <T_1> overlooked <T_8> .
and <T_1> high-ankle design <T_2> human-like <T_3> , &#91; unclear &#93; and <T_0> .
<T_1> i said in the <T_2> , i wasn &apos;t going to tell you <T_0> exports .
<T_3> large <T_0> of riots <T_2> broken into the <T_4> projects of <T_1> .
<T_0> in hospitals <T_6> doubled in <T_2> last few years , and <T_5> affects not <T_3> the patients <T_7> also the people <T_4> there <T_1>
so my <T_0> sense , <T_4> good <T_3> , were in <T_2> with my <T_1> .
<T_1> this <T_2> the <T_3> -- we would have <T_0> change .
you <T_0> touch it .
so , one thing <T_8> would like <T_5> medical community , and <T_9> legal community , and even <T_3> college <T_6> , <T_7> see if they can understand , <T_2> indeed , romantic <T_1> is one of the most <T_4> substances <T_0> earth .
and here i <T_9> with a pregnant woman , <T_8> is hiv positive <T_4> we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , <T_1> we &apos;re very confident , <T_6> we know <T_7> that young woman is <T_3> treatment <T_0> her life can be extended to take care of <T_2> baby <T_5> &apos;s about to give birth to .
it &apos;s the same <T_1> at many different <T_0> .
<T_2> i decided , i &apos;m <T_1> make this a <T_0> biennial .
<T_4> little <T_3> kept me going <T_7> the <T_5> , and <T_2> i got <T_1> private pilot &apos;s license , and <T_8> i learned <T_6> navigate , and i <T_0> my friends <T_9> australia .
according to <T_6> story , early humans developed <T_2> conceit <T_7> , <T_0> using <T_4> language to work together , they <T_3> build a <T_5> that <T_8> take them <T_9> the way to <T_1> .
so exactly <T_2> did <T_0> grow <T_1> much faster ?
i <T_5> them by the <T_1> of twigs <T_7> branch and <T_6> number of <T_2> per tree and then divided that <T_4> the <T_3> of <T_8> per <T_0> .
<T_1> , <T_3> three-digit -- -- <T_0> three-digit <T_2> , sir ?
<T_1> say i <T_0> is to <T_2> i <T_3> , i ask .
and , as an <T_3> of all of this then , i <T_0> about <T_5> we <T_1> , <T_7> whether we <T_2> should , think <T_8> transporting earth-type life <T_4> other <T_6> .
another <T_1> , a <T_0> thing happened .
<T_3> , <T_1> &apos;ve taken it <T_4> , component <T_0> component , months and months and months of <T_2> .
<T_1> learning <T_2> most <T_0> a self-organizing system .
a <T_0> of us have been <T_3> on a <T_1> basis to address individual <T_4> for bribes for <T_2> services or entitlement . <T_5>
so then <T_1> grab a <T_0> of them <T_4> i put <T_2> on a <T_3> .
<T_8> when <T_6> was capturing <T_1> , <T_5> know , this <T_3> comes to <T_0> always : is it , only when <T_4> object touches the thing and <T_2> leaves the <T_7> , <T_9> is there other ways to capture it ? &quot;
just <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_4> take <T_2> the current <T_0> there and the intervention ?
<T_2> definition <T_0> concussion <T_3> &apos;t actually require <T_1> loss of consciousness .
so <T_2> &apos;re really <T_3> the <T_0> of wearable <T_1> actually .
<T_1> the <T_2> wasn &apos;t fast <T_0> for us .
if i could summarize <T_7> in <T_1> sentence , it <T_0> be <T_8> : <T_3> is not <T_2> solving for <T_4> , <T_5> &apos;s also <T_6> out why .
and <T_3> i thought about it a little <T_4> , and i <T_2> , &quot; <T_0> , <T_5> it <T_6> that <T_1> ?
we <T_0> feel guilty if <T_2> &apos;re seen <T_1> at work .
essentially , for three <T_3> : <T_7> , application , and <T_1> , <T_0> unfortunately <T_4> in terms <T_2> the <T_6> we give it , <T_5> .
and i <T_0> we <T_4> turn this <T_5> story around to one <T_2> celebration <T_1> one of <T_3> .
i &apos;m about <T_3> the <T_8> to build something <T_2> will grow and intensify <T_5> original <T_0> and not <T_9> require <T_1> giving <T_6> year -- i &apos;m not <T_4> to feed <T_7> habit .
<T_6> this is exactly how <T_4> cancer cell becomes <T_3> cancer cells , <T_0> cancer cells become <T_5> cancer cells , <T_1> we have ultimately uncontrolled <T_2> growth .
because <T_0> data <T_3> goes back to , at best , <T_1> ii , for the most part <T_2>
their <T_0> , their <T_2> , is something to <T_5> marvel at , <T_4> i think it &apos;s really the <T_3> of the human <T_1> project .
the <T_3> fox is <T_1> woman who &apos;s <T_0> crafts , <T_2> she <T_5> these pop-up crafts <T_4> around london .
in fact , if <T_7> have a look at <T_3> studies that they were looking at , the <T_5> they were <T_2> and examining , <T_6> can see <T_9> suspects were <T_1> armed in <T_8> 15 percent of <T_0> where o.c. spray was <T_4> .
<T_4> needed <T_3> to hold the <T_2> up <T_1> there in the middle of the traffic <T_0> .
as always , i <T_4> return to <T_7> , and often to animated <T_1> at friend &apos;s homes , where <T_0> would discuss various issues <T_3> they complained <T_8> about the <T_9> pub <T_5> , where a <T_2> often cost more <T_6> what they &apos;d paid their 14-year-old maid .
<T_2> &apos;s the gecko running up <T_1> vertical <T_5> . <T_7> it goes , <T_6> real time . <T_3> it goes <T_4> . obviously , we <T_8> to <T_9> this down <T_0> little bit .
what turned out to determine <T_9> someone would stop <T_4> help <T_1> stranger in need was how much of a <T_6> they thought they were in -- <T_3> they feeling they <T_2> late , <T_0> were they <T_8> in <T_5> they were going to <T_7> about .
<T_1> psychology , <T_0> .
now this <T_1> several years <T_4> . adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s <T_5> decent <T_2> of money <T_3> a few <T_0> of work .
in <T_2> i <T_0> eiffel tower in paris <T_1>
<T_0> of all , we have <T_2> these <T_3> in our <T_1> .
<T_5> would be <T_1> right or <T_0> and <T_4> hope beyond <T_2> brief years <T_3> earth . &quot;
deep .
thank you .
my <T_0> is joshua <T_1> .
<T_4> in doing <T_2> , we &apos;re going to <T_6> what <T_5> &apos;ve really come to take <T_1> granted , <T_3> is the freedom to <T_0> very effortlessly around the world <T_7>
very <T_2> to do , so <T_0> is <T_3> a lot of <T_1> .
thank you very much .
<T_3> the <T_9> of president <T_0> , &quot; <T_7> the <T_2> take over again , they will invite <T_8> al-qaeda , who will <T_1> to kill <T_5> many of <T_4> people as they possibly <T_6> . &quot;
that <T_3> have <T_6> and clay <T_4> calligraphy and <T_5> your eye turns , there &apos;s something <T_0> looking back at you , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;t be <T_3> . there &apos;s nothing <T_1> about <T_2> .
this <T_1> a <T_2> hard <T_0> watch .
<T_1> you look <T_2> some <T_3> these other <T_0> -- concussions .
she &apos;s <T_1> licensed <T_0> that ; <T_3> has <T_2> done it .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_2> big <T_1> about it .
if <T_2> guess wisely , we can construct <T_5> standard charges <T_1> six charge dimensions <T_3> a broken <T_0> of this more <T_4> pattern in <T_6> charge <T_7> .
<T_4> though <T_1> &apos;m a <T_3> star , i just <T_5> to assure you that <T_2> of my wishes will include <T_6> hot <T_0> .
because <T_2> can type , you know , any kind of thing <T_4> google , <T_0> you expect an <T_1> back , <T_3> ?
<T_2> why <T_1> they <T_0> similar ?
and , as <T_1> says , there is a <T_0> for videos <T_2> me .
<T_4> tallest <T_2> on earth at <T_1> time were less <T_0> two <T_3> .
<T_6> as <T_1> &apos;re <T_3> about that , <T_5> happens is you get more and <T_2> complexity , more <T_4> more stuff to build <T_0> things with .
<T_2> i want everyone to <T_3> the critical <T_1> of shifting charity <T_0> enterprise .
<T_1> your <T_0> , and celebrate it <T_2>
<T_3> study showed <T_1> food companies exaggerated <T_0> seven times <T_4> than an independent <T_2> .
and <T_3> question <T_5> -- <T_4> we started to <T_1> this question <T_7> centuries -- <T_0> to how we get <T_6> kids involved in <T_2> .
according to <T_0> , in <T_2> years <T_3> the mountain <T_1> will be gone .
<T_1> i &apos;m always <T_2> around , <T_3> , <T_4> is my <T_0> ?
a <T_4> crisis , just <T_6> we <T_7> seen , <T_2> not be solved <T_5> america alone or <T_0> alone ; it <T_1> the <T_3> to work together .
<T_1> know , <T_3> i &apos;ve interviewed <T_4> 1,000 lottery buyers <T_2> the <T_0> .
polio <T_0> rhino : they &apos;re in <T_2> same <T_4> , <T_3> close to <T_1> other .
<T_3> things go <T_2> as we move out onto <T_1> arctic <T_0> .
so , i &apos;ve been <T_0> lucky <T_1> an inventor .
<T_0> , <T_6> systems are <T_1> hard to map into <T_4> equations , so <T_2> usual <T_5> approach doesn &apos;t really <T_3> here .
i <T_0> shocked .
and <T_0> world health <T_3> predicts <T_4> the <T_1> 2020 that <T_6> will be the <T_2> cause of <T_5> .
how <T_4> we get here <T_5> we devote <T_2> of acres <T_1> thousands of <T_3> to <T_0> ?
so you <T_3> , &quot; aw , <T_2> on <T_4> , anybody can <T_0> that <T_1> a psych <T_6> text <T_7> an <T_5> like that . &quot;
i &apos;m talking <T_7> you <T_6> the worst <T_4> of human rights <T_2> , <T_1> third-largest <T_0> crime , a $ <T_5> billion <T_3> .
<T_2> so we <T_4> look at literally <T_3> of features at once <T_0> of that <T_1> of blood .
<T_5> want to share <T_2> you some ideas about the <T_7> power <T_3> time , all <T_1> , <T_0> the <T_6> please . <T_4> seconds studio .
<T_3> was very generously in the process of giving birth to <T_0> first <T_1> -- -- and <T_4> was there <T_2> a catcher &apos;s <T_5> .
<T_1> , here <T_0> have my <T_2> slide .
and this is -- <T_7> , at the <T_1> -- i did <T_5> 10 <T_2> ago -- <T_4> was <T_0> years <T_6> the <T_3> lama had left .
i <T_2> you very much <T_0> your <T_1> .
<T_1> i <T_3> we <T_0> found <T_4> , simultaneously , an eye-opening and a very <T_2> experience .
and <T_0> don &apos;t want to end up <T_4> the two-minute silence to give you more time <T_5> think <T_3> it , until <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> a view . <T_6> .
<T_3> should we respect <T_1> privacy , <T_0> his dignity and leave him <T_2> ?
<T_3> problem <T_6> this <T_5> is that <T_1> are some amazing <T_2> that need to <T_4> aren &apos;t profitable <T_0> say .
<T_0> al-mutawa : <T_2> inspired by <T_1>
with <T_4> visual <T_6> colleagues , <T_5> map complex <T_3> algorithms that <T_0> in time <T_1> space , visually <T_2> sonically .
<T_2> did <T_7> not <T_1> -- <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> we &apos;ve all forgotten -- <T_6> we &apos;re not <T_5> first ones <T_3> build .
and <T_3> can guarantee a clean , <T_1> sky <T_4> an <T_0> future <T_2> nuclear power .
so <T_5> birds going to <T_6> , to <T_2> , <T_1> to africa carried <T_4> virus , which <T_3> not previously been <T_0> .
the number of molecules per glassful is <T_3> greater than the number of <T_9> , or <T_6> , <T_2> the <T_1> -- and , of course , there &apos;s nothing special about cromwell or <T_7> . <T_8> have just breathed in <T_4> nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the <T_5> of the tall <T_0> tree .
<T_0> how <T_1> the <T_2> run ?
<T_3> are <T_2> very low-budget <T_0> , like <T_1> prototypes .
but <T_5> we have <T_0> to <T_9> kinds of data that <T_1> us <T_4> understand social processes and <T_7> phenomena in <T_3> entirely new <T_6> that <T_8> never before <T_2> .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s <T_2> . <T_3> you <T_0> never <T_1> .
<T_1> is <T_0> m.s. patient .
so , he <T_0> &apos;t say <T_1> .
what this does <T_1> transforms , <T_0> , <T_2> farmers &apos; relationship <T_4> the <T_3> .
to do <T_0> , at a <T_6> point , <T_5> need <T_2> to <T_1> you out of <T_4> flock and <T_3> another <T_7> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> matter of <T_1> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_5> the <T_4> who <T_6> &apos;t <T_1> human <T_3> don &apos;t deserve to be <T_0> very nicely .
i <T_6> into <T_7> face of <T_8> of these <T_0> , <T_1> i <T_2> in her <T_3> the <T_4> that arises when natural <T_5> is really present .
and if <T_9> were able to <T_6> spaces <T_4> we <T_2> come across works where we would be told , use <T_7> works of art to cement these <T_1> in your <T_8> , <T_5> would get a <T_0> more out of <T_3> .
in about <T_3> to <T_0> hours , <T_2> started <T_1> move .
<T_2> started my <T_0> 30 <T_1> ago .
the only way that <T_2> can let the <T_1> believe is when <T_0> show hard core <T_3> .
<T_0> to 10 <T_1> years ! <T_3> imagine <T_2> .
<T_0> , right <T_4> , <T_1> can actually miniaturize biological <T_3> chemistry laboratories onto <T_2> chips .
and , you know , <T_1> was the <T_0> female u.s. sprinter .
and <T_8> cloud <T_7> compacted , gravity gets <T_9> powerful as <T_2> increases , the temperature begins to rise at the <T_5> of each cloud , and then , at the <T_0> of each cloud , the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million <T_4> , protons start <T_1> fuse , there &apos;s <T_6> huge <T_3> of energy , and , bam !
<T_2> will create <T_1> opportunities in <T_0> .
<T_0> is based <T_3> the files <T_2> by mr. <T_1> .
tom <T_2> : hello , <T_1> , <T_0> is <T_3> .
so <T_2> me first start <T_1> the personal <T_0> .
companies <T_2> goods , but governments , they make public goods . <T_5> work on the <T_4> for cancer <T_0> educating our <T_1> and making roads , but <T_9> don &apos;t have institutions that <T_3> particularly good at this kind of complexity . we don &apos;t have institutions that are <T_8> at bringing our talents to bear , at working with us <T_6> this kind of open and collaborative <T_7> .
<T_4> of all , we associate <T_6> click sound <T_5> a food <T_3> , which <T_1> smashed banana <T_2> peanuts together <T_0> a <T_7> .
and then <T_2> did a <T_0> school for loyola <T_1> downtown l.a .
i was still trying to take in the <T_0> that these <T_4> , these <T_5> of the universe , <T_3> their spare time watch <T_8> potter movies , when mr. <T_7> thought he would win <T_2> argument by <T_1> , &quot; you <T_6> think it &apos;s so good because you didn &apos;t read the <T_9> . &quot;
<T_5> , by the <T_4> , a <T_0> study <T_1> that mothers prefer the <T_3> of the <T_6> diapers of their own <T_2> .
<T_3> book is taking <T_0> a <T_2> time , <T_4> i &apos;m nearly <T_1> .
fifty <T_1> years <T_2> achieve this maximum body <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> pile of <T_1> .
and we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him , we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his <T_6> , and his universe <T_5> , you know , behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that <T_7> he can actually <T_3> through and do it this way , and we <T_8> to make it feel that this is his <T_2> , everyday sort of life , so the idea of doing it as one shot was <T_4> important , and of course , in shooting in 3d , <T_1> is basically it &apos;s a huge camera that &apos;s hanging off of a giant stick , so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task , <T_0> make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the &quot; <T_9> &quot; shot .
like <T_1> said , contagious <T_2> a <T_0> word .
and , again , that &apos;s where these <T_0> technologies can come <T_1> .
i say <T_0> because these <T_2> difficult <T_1> .
<T_6> , avatars are a way <T_3> express <T_4> true <T_1> , <T_0> most heroic , idealized <T_2> of who we <T_5> become .
<T_3> is <T_0> blog <T_7> iraq , <T_4> it &apos;s <T_1> really <T_2> i &apos;m going to <T_8> about , but i just wanted <T_5> show you an <T_6> .
but <T_1> waits that long to <T_7> them as <T_3> and <T_5> as <T_0> can because they <T_6> <T_4> chickens &apos; favorite form <T_2> protein .
and <T_2> , <T_4> assignment to <T_5> students was , <T_1> should the <T_3> of tomorrow <T_0> ?
<T_3> must be <T_1> place <T_4> the <T_0> for <T_2> that <T_7> only <T_6> for a locality , and yet , one can be able to <T_5> them .
<T_0> that &apos;s <T_4> deep sea , that &apos;s the <T_2> that we <T_5> to be among the <T_3> pristine left <T_1> earth .
<T_0> thing is , sometimes <T_4> watch <T_2> on <T_5> mobile phone , they are bigger than <T_1> phone <T_3> .
<T_3> mean , <T_2> many of <T_0> commercials that come out <T_1> -- in the way of a <T_5> , <T_6> &apos;s really being <T_4> ?
<T_1> accurate <T_0> .
<T_0> if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from <T_2> very specific <T_1> .
<T_6> i <T_0> what &apos;s kept me <T_4> coming <T_8> year after year <T_2> another thing , and that is <T_1> look <T_7> her face , <T_5> conflicted <T_3> on her face .
so <T_1> is <T_2> &apos;s answer to <T_0> problem <T_3> uncertainty ?
well , <T_4> good <T_2> is , &quot; <T_1> depends . <T_0> is <T_3> ? &quot;
now what <T_1> did was we brought a <T_9> into <T_5> scanner -- <T_3> way -- had <T_6> memorize this <T_4> and then had another <T_8> out <T_0> the control room trading back <T_7> forth <T_2> .
and <T_2> , about <T_5> years ago , <T_1> harnessing <T_8> electromagnetic <T_3> to send sound <T_0> images through <T_4> air -- <T_7> and <T_6> .
we start <T_1> day one of <T_3> project -- we &apos;ve learned , <T_0> don &apos;t make <T_2> , we don &apos;t do <T_4> .
and <T_3> jim <T_7> it , <T_6> was only <T_0> sub , <T_5> he was <T_1> from the other , and <T_4> don &apos;t remember <T_9> i did this <T_8> jim <T_2> this .
<T_6> of this <T_5> say <T_0> the <T_2> between what <T_3> can perceive <T_7> what we <T_4> measure is only going to <T_1> .
we <T_2> &apos;t just <T_7> , &quot; well , if <T_3> &apos;re young <T_6> to benefit <T_0> these <T_5> , <T_4> they &apos;ll live <T_8> years <T_1> . &quot;
i &apos;ll <T_0> swim right through <T_1> .
<T_1> you <T_0> down ?
so <T_5> want to <T_6> by saying : <T_7> of life &apos;s puzzles <T_1> be solved by <T_2> your time <T_4> and <T_3> of <T_0> .
so they construct it , <T_7> they can <T_5> all kinds of forms at the <T_4> . this is the work of design students <T_3> the royal college of <T_1> in london that have been working together <T_8> their tutor , tony dunne , and <T_2> a bunch of scientists around great <T_0> on the possibilities <T_9> nanotechnology <T_6> design in the future .
so , if <T_9> have <T_7> quick look at the history of cymatics <T_5> with <T_1> observations of resonance , <T_4> da <T_0> , galileo , the english <T_2> robert <T_6> and <T_8> ernest <T_3> .
<T_2> i gotta have <T_0> hot <T_1> .
what it <T_6> , as <T_2> carter <T_1> discovered , <T_4> to be able to <T_3> , &quot; <T_5> can &apos;t <T_0> this by myself .
so <T_4> some <T_2> , we <T_1> that <T_3> baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of <T_0> most brilliant <T_5> .
<T_0> also evaluate these <T_2> much <T_1> positively <T_3> . &quot;
<T_1> did <T_0> evolve for <T_2> survival .
<T_3> didn &apos;t give <T_1> forms to me <T_2> explain <T_0> was in the form .
and <T_2> proposal was to split <T_8> museum into two -- <T_0> permanent exhibits <T_1> one end , the auditorium , <T_9> , <T_6> changing exhibitions <T_3> the other -- to flood the valley into a <T_4> of water gardens and to link it <T_7> to the fort and to the <T_5> .
it <T_1> a <T_3> story . mel <T_2> did <T_0> sequel .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> clue that <T_3> early <T_0> is not chosen <T_2> .
<T_1> however you put <T_0> , <T_2> know , <T_4> numbers do not make any <T_3> .
<T_2> just <T_1> the road , this <T_0> jet .
<T_2> is <T_0> adaptive <T_5> , <T_6> we extend and <T_1> in <T_3> creation <T_4> enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look <T_2> computerized text analysis of <T_1> who commit suicide , what <T_4> find there , and <T_0> &apos;s quite <T_3> , <T_5> use of the first <T_6> singular -- &quot; <T_7> , &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; my , &quot; not &quot; we &quot; and &quot; us &quot; -- and the letters are less hopeless than they <T_8> really <T_9> .
<T_1> are <T_0> to get involved politically <T_3> interfere in that <T_2> .
china &apos;s dalian commodity <T_0> , <T_2> years ago , <T_3> , overtook <T_1> chicago board of <T_7> to <T_5> the second <T_6> exchange in the <T_4> .
<T_3> are , of course , more <T_4> those <T_2> projects <T_0> i &apos;m <T_1> here .
imagine his <T_0> and <T_1> him <T_3> the <T_2> .
<T_1> hold <T_0> conference .
around <T_4> , in <T_1> with <T_5> nagel <T_0> karl <T_3> , this vision came to <T_2> .
in <T_0> one single <T_1> of ice , you have <T_3> species of <T_2> .
i think <T_7> need to be teaching <T_1> skills to kids <T_4> adults at <T_2> stage of <T_3> development , <T_6> we want to have <T_0> organizations and <T_5> thinking <T_8> .
as <T_4> senior <T_9> approaches <T_7> a <T_1> , layma stands up with deliberation , <T_2> her <T_6> up over her <T_8> , and begins , very <T_3> , to untie her headdress that <T_0> her <T_5> .
<T_4> could be <T_2> , <T_3> filling or <T_1> for your family <T_0> broiling a <T_5> ?
think of <T_0> that <T_1> .
so , that &apos;s what i <T_1> to <T_0> about today .
chris <T_2> , <T_3> i trust <T_8> all <T_5> , editor-in-chief <T_0> wired <T_7> and <T_9> of &quot; the <T_6> tail , &quot; really was the first -- for <T_4> -- to nail a lot <T_1> this .
<T_4> sent <T_5> in the <T_7> union <T_0> privatization plans <T_1> it <T_6> up , and what they <T_2> lacked was social <T_3> .
<T_4> few hours later , it <T_1> gone up <T_5> 23.6 million <T_3> , <T_2> shipping and <T_0> .
<T_3> was just <T_5> a couple of weeks ago , and we &apos;re very <T_7> to see how <T_1> she will be <T_9> , <T_2> she is <T_8> out in <T_6> streets <T_0> rangoon , <T_4> for change .
<T_2> are kind of drifting out of <T_0> cultural <T_1> , <T_4> i <T_5> is a terrible <T_3> .
from <T_2> point , <T_1> can then , <T_5> you <T_4> to , <T_6> multiple languages , <T_3> them so there <T_0> no interference .
<T_4> then , i &apos;ll <T_0> telling <T_3> . i <T_2> you <T_1> laughing .
no <T_5> here , so <T_3> can focus <T_6> the <T_7> , the acoustics , of a new <T_4> of <T_0> : <T_2> to <T_1> .
and <T_1> you blow <T_4> up , <T_2> have these little <T_0> on the <T_3> .
so one <T_1> to discover a <T_2> <T_0> .
diving <T_1> and <T_3> was really <T_2> for <T_8> in 1970 , when i led a <T_4> of <T_7> living <T_5> for <T_0> at a time -- at the same time that <T_6> were putting their <T_9> on the moon .
because in the <T_6> four <T_5> we &apos;ve seen all <T_0> of memes , <T_2> kinds of <T_4> get <T_3> right <T_1> our front <T_7> .
so this <T_2> more <T_0> -- large organ , vascular , <T_3> lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of <T_1> present .
<T_0> then , <T_2> do <T_1> do about that ?
but i <T_0> &apos;t have to bother <T_1> wife <T_3> that kind of <T_2> .
<T_2> 1990 , we <T_0> the line of being <T_4> a <T_3> relationship <T_1> the planet .
<T_2> titanium &apos;s <T_4> thousand <T_3> , but the <T_0> are very <T_1> .
and <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> bicentenary of <T_0> darwin .
and so we <T_6> this situation come <T_7> -- <T_2> summer actually , <T_4> agnor-hurt school in <T_0> county -- and one of <T_8> military commanders got up to read <T_9> letter <T_5> one of the other <T_1> said , &quot; mr. <T_3> , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot;
some <T_4> , perhaps <T_3> , we &apos;ll have <T_2> virus <T_0> is going to <T_5> all of <T_1> .
<T_0> can <T_1> a third dimensionality to the <T_2> .
<T_0> it &apos;s no longer just <T_7> &quot; i don &apos;t <T_8> . <T_1> couldn &apos;t get there . i <T_3> i &apos;ll move on , &quot; but suddenly <T_2> collective <T_5> about <T_4> is blocked <T_9> censored <T_6> online .
but now <T_0> &apos;s a <T_1> .
and , over time , we started understanding and <T_7> researching <T_1> this tinkering <T_3> is about , because that is something <T_6> &apos;s <T_4> not just <T_0> one street <T_5> in <T_2> .
<T_0> : <T_2> i do . <T_3> remember <T_1> every chapter .
<T_2> tried <T_1> negotiate syria <T_0> couldn &apos;t do it .
<T_5> in <T_0> language , it &apos;s <T_1> about 140 <T_4> , means <T_2> paragraph , <T_3> story .
freud <T_0> it right .
<T_4> do realize that <T_0> fight for <T_1> against <T_2> is never <T_3> .
( <T_0> spyfish <T_2> a <T_1> subaquatic video camera .
<T_5> the <T_0> , a small organism appeared <T_1> richmond , <T_4> , <T_3> the hemlock woolly <T_2> .
and they &apos;re <T_2> moving to <T_3> central system , this <T_1> connected <T_6> , <T_5> of them except <T_0> . can you guess which <T_4> ?
<T_2> , <T_0> call me the local <T_1> .
and <T_0> the review , <T_5> they were <T_6> in seeing is <T_3> kind of <T_1> most reliably raise levels of <T_4> , <T_7> central <T_2> hormone .
indeed , arranged marriages are on their way <T_2> this <T_0> of <T_1> life .
<T_2> ain &apos;t happening , hasn &apos;t <T_1> for 30 <T_0> , ok ?
could <T_5> calm them down -- they were <T_0> like <T_1> and <T_6> have pathways all <T_3> up -- and make <T_2> to the <T_4> of the normal ?
so you <T_0> the <T_2> and you think , &quot; <T_5> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> snake <T_4> there . &quot;
now <T_1> those 12,000 chairs freaked <T_4> out with the <T_2> number , i want <T_0> just for a second to think of <T_5> million <T_3> .
<T_1> i realized that the <T_5> of the <T_2> continent would matter <T_0> my children <T_4> their <T_3> .
<T_1> , <T_0> did it .
and <T_0> have also , every <T_3> , seen less <T_2> less sea <T_1> .
<T_2> could perhaps be <T_8> self-organizing <T_6> , so that was <T_3> second bit that <T_0> wanted to <T_7> you , <T_9> children <T_1> self-organize <T_5> attain an <T_4> objective .
now , the <T_6> is , <T_7> food <T_1> your <T_9> get every day <T_2> fast food , <T_0> &apos;s highly <T_4> , <T_8> &apos;s not <T_3> fresh food <T_5> there at all .
so <T_3> couchsurf a <T_1> . i also <T_2> a <T_0> .
<T_0> &quot; <T_5> of the <T_1> system , &quot; <T_4> kept emphasizing <T_3> laws of <T_2> are universal .
<T_6> is a subset of data from <T_1> database -- <T_8> 50,000 out <T_2> several million -- and <T_7> social <T_5> that <T_0> them <T_4> publicly available <T_3> .
<T_3> : <T_0> do <T_2> think <T_4> is ? i <T_1> &apos;t know .
we <T_0> a <T_5> . it <T_2> the same <T_3> dollars <T_4> the gas <T_1> .
but it <T_0> too <T_1> .
<T_0> this object <T_5> , better than <T_4> and <T_3> before you , what <T_2> really <T_1> .
<T_2> doodled a lot as a <T_5> , and <T_0> you spend enough time <T_6> , sooner <T_1> later , <T_7> happens : <T_4> your career <T_3> run out .
<T_1> &apos;s enough <T_3> to <T_2> the daily electrical needs of <T_0> american households .
but i think <T_3> has given <T_5> this building <T_6> we <T_2> all the time for <T_4> , that &apos;s <T_7> , <T_1> has given <T_0> for us .
<T_4> people <T_1> that very soothing , and , <T_0> , <T_2> cycles per <T_3> is roughly <T_6> of the breathing of a sleeping <T_5> .
it &apos;s not .
<T_0> developed an <T_2> coition <T_1> .
and <T_2> mother <T_1> that <T_4> information must have come <T_3> my <T_0> .
we had -- <T_0> a few <T_3> colleagues <T_1> connected by a computer <T_2> .
<T_7> answer <T_3> , &quot; the problem <T_5> &apos;t the people <T_0> you <T_6> . <T_4> problem <T_1> that you chose <T_2> . &quot;
so i <T_1> doing <T_0> .
<T_3> small <T_2> we put together is looking for <T_1> ways to <T_0> .
i got <T_0> this morning <T_1> 6 : <T_2> a.m .
so , one <T_6> i had <T_8> opportunity <T_0> meet one of <T_3> guys , and <T_7> said , &quot; <T_5> do <T_2> paint like that ? <T_1> taught <T_4> ? &quot;
so <T_0> job . quest <T_1> three .
<T_3> , i <T_1> in the <T_2> for a long <T_0> .
now , <T_4> know <T_1> you learn a new <T_0> , and <T_5> you start <T_6> see <T_2> word <T_3> ?
he <T_4> , &quot; <T_2> &apos;m 48 <T_1> old , and i have <T_5> at <T_0> factory for <T_3> years .
i think <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> chance <T_3> have a dialogue , a conversation <T_0> sustainability <T_4> worldchanging.com .
with <T_4> , <T_2> have a <T_1> proportion of beta waves <T_3> focus states and <T_0> high proportion <T_5> theta states .
it <T_4> a tanzanian team talking <T_1> the <T_0> , <T_2> what <T_3> were interested <T_5> .
<T_1> they positively <T_0> ? giving <T_2> makes you <T_3> .
<T_2> &apos;s <T_0> more important <T_3> running anti-viruses or running <T_1> .
<T_9> i <T_0> &apos;t help notice that <T_2> people who were <T_6> the appalling <T_8> , the paramilitary <T_3> , were actually the <T_7> people <T_1> the <T_4> criminal <T_5> .
little did <T_5> know at that time that <T_0> trip <T_6> the dump and some research <T_9> the internet and plucking up <T_7> courage to <T_2> upon inspiration would take us <T_1> a life-changing <T_4> of <T_8> and <T_3> .
<T_7> has <T_1> like swimming pools , it has flextime , <T_6> has <T_0> social <T_3> , a <T_2> , <T_4> have contact <T_5> nature .
but <T_2> -- my <T_0> -- doesn &apos;t show up on <T_1> .
so <T_1> is a single <T_0> .
it <T_0> recalibrate <T_1> &apos;s most <T_3> in <T_2> life .
and <T_5> run <T_1> in <T_3> very <T_0> regions where <T_2> &apos;s no <T_4> care whatsoever .
you <T_0> &apos;t quite <T_1> .
how do you <T_0> people from taking <T_1> sort <T_2> action on the data <T_3> you &apos;re <T_4> ?
<T_1> i <T_0> to <T_2> the market -- <T_3> size of the market .
and this is <T_0> common , it &apos;s moving very quickly , <T_1> &apos;s moving <T_4> a <T_3> series <T_2> places .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> .
but the fact is , i &apos;ve been <T_4> to get a <T_3> to <T_6> all over the <T_1> , and <T_5> did a lot of <T_0> in the <T_2> east .
<T_2> &apos;s fixed in a <T_0> spasm <T_1> it &apos;s excruciatingly <T_3> .
there &apos;s <T_3> way of <T_1> the internet based <T_2> the first <T_0> .
the <T_1> people <T_3> my high <T_2> were <T_0> geeky , and there was <T_7> way i was going <T_6> have <T_5> to do <T_4> those people .
how <T_2> you feel <T_0> you were me ? <T_5> have something <T_7> in your <T_3> , but you <T_1> in the <T_4> of <T_6> ?
now , <T_1> is <T_3> low powered laser , and we <T_4> actually <T_0> up a wing-beat <T_2> .
<T_0> one question <T_5> you <T_4> then want to ask <T_3> , what <T_1> when we <T_2> ?
<T_3> is <T_0> story <T_4> the yacht club that &apos;s all <T_2> blue <T_1> .
<T_1> , in <T_0> ways , said it <T_2> .
let &apos;s first <T_3> at the <T_1> of <T_2> radiation <T_0> the earth &apos;s surface .
<T_3> me you &apos;re going <T_0> be out there making a <T_4> dollars <T_2> year -- that &apos;s not <T_1> .
this <T_4> not just <T_9> china building roads and ports and <T_8> in her own country -- she &apos;s been able to build 85,000 kilometers of <T_3> network in china and surpass that of <T_1> united states -- but even if you look to places <T_6> africa , china has been able to help tar <T_0> distance of cape town <T_7> cairo , which is 9,000 miles , or three times the <T_5> of new york <T_2> california .
<T_4> the <T_0> of his <T_6> , <T_7> kids and his <T_3> , generated enough <T_2> , <T_5> motivation <T_1> him , so that he actually <T_8> up .
and <T_4> you make this <T_2> , you can use <T_5> kind of <T_3> grain <T_0> any type of <T_1> .
so i <T_3> , <T_1> don &apos;t <T_2> get into <T_0> business ?
<T_8> , <T_1> &apos;ll be honest <T_4> you <T_7> say <T_3> most <T_5> is just a <T_6> , <T_2> it &apos;s a trick that actually <T_0> .
<T_2> rather , if <T_4> is an <T_0> , <T_7> is <T_6> remind myself that <T_5> is uncertainty in <T_3> , <T_9> that <T_1> good , because then i will discover <T_8> new .
<T_0> degruy : hooked by an octopus
they &apos;ve <T_0> them like <T_1> in an <T_2> .
last point , intelligence community -- the muscle <T_0> the defense <T_1> go this way .
<T_2> contributes <T_0> little <T_1> .
and <T_2> take <T_3> dna back <T_1> the laboratory and you <T_0> it .
here <T_1> in the field <T_0> .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_4> study <T_1> of <T_7> think you <T_3> about , but very <T_0> people have ever read <T_6> story . you <T_2> the <T_8> .
<T_0> , as <T_1> &apos;s <T_6> of marketing <T_3> , &quot; <T_5> &apos;re <T_4> in <T_2> business of keeping media companies alive .
<T_1> wish <T_0> could do this <T_4> a <T_2> , <T_3> mark <T_5> version of his book .
<T_5> when <T_2> see ed &apos;s <T_1> i think , why <T_6> hell <T_4> i going <T_3> china ? <T_0> &apos;s true .
however , there &apos;s <T_1> to <T_5> about your <T_4> star <T_0> just how much <T_2> you receive <T_3> .
and <T_0> of the women was <T_6> -- there on your <T_3> left -- <T_5> was one of <T_8> first <T_7> women <T_4> in rwanda , and <T_1> legacy should have been <T_9> be one of the mothers of <T_2> .
and <T_0> were the <T_1> to &quot; <T_2> &quot; <T_3> .
richard <T_3> : <T_1> &apos;m richard <T_4> , <T_0> this is the <T_2> tabernacle choir .
maybe you play <T_3> games , and that &apos;s what <T_1> &apos;re making <T_0> now . this is <T_2> lighter <T_4> .
so i &apos;ve told <T_2> a bit about what <T_7> did to try and <T_3> , kicking <T_6> screaming , into <T_9> 21st <T_1> , and i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of <T_0> a few other <T_4> i <T_8> are doing <T_5>
a <T_1> activist once <T_2> to <T_4> , &quot; <T_0> do you cook a <T_3> ?
that &apos;s also <T_1> of being <T_0> .
and i just <T_0> to <T_2> : there &apos;s one <T_1> that came .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_0> about ?
<T_0> on this <T_7> , <T_6> this <T_2> , <T_4> walked <T_5> the house with <T_3> first child , <T_1> beautiful baby boy .
and i saw <T_1> , and <T_2> watched <T_0> .
but <T_5> are indeed <T_4> for a <T_0> crisis , <T_3> i &apos;d like <T_1> to become aware of this <T_2> .
<T_4> lowest <T_2> is actually <T_3> bottom <T_1> of <T_0> tower like this .
and maybe that makes you <T_0> , &quot; <T_1> .
so i conjured up an <T_5> that i &apos;m later going to <T_0> you what i <T_1> to do , <T_3> is kind of the heart <T_8> the movie , for me , <T_7> so that &apos;s why <T_9> wanted to <T_2> the movie , that &apos;s why i wanted to create <T_6> sort of things <T_4> created .
that &apos;s <T_0> machine <T_2> showed in <T_1> .
in fact , what <T_5> did a <T_0> years ago <T_7> learn <T_2> to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo <T_6> use it to <T_3> test <T_9> dna <T_8> of whale meat samples <T_4> identify what they <T_1> were .
<T_0> : i &apos;m <T_1> .
<T_3> then <T_2> question is : <T_0> don &apos;t <T_1> ?
what <T_1> be the <T_0> ?
<T_3> diseases thrive <T_0> this environment , <T_4> most drastic <T_1> which is called <T_2> .
<T_5> would run <T_1> thing all <T_3> long , running these things , <T_2> anybody <T_4> stephen wolfram , who <T_0> this stuff .
<T_1> they would come up with <T_0> these <T_2> .
i think you have <T_0> build <T_3> homes <T_2> put smart <T_1> in it .
as a <T_8> of fact , diy people <T_6> all over the <T_1> , <T_0> , <T_7> , got together <T_5> year , and <T_2> hammered out a <T_3> code <T_4> ethics .
now , i <T_6> all these <T_1> are sort of working like <T_3> sticks -- <T_7> &apos;re bouncing along <T_5> they move . and you can see <T_9> in <T_4> ghost <T_8> , from the beaches <T_0> panama and <T_2> carolina .
<T_6> &apos;s also related <T_0> the <T_5> that <T_1> subsidize our people , <T_4> all the <T_2> and <T_7> arguments that <T_3> have .
in fact <T_4> you <T_1> at world <T_3> you can see <T_0> reasons <T_2> optimism .
<T_1> , <T_0> here .
and <T_6> i <T_5> away from that , i had <T_0> crystallization , probably <T_7> the <T_1> , <T_4> it was <T_2> insult <T_3> a way .
so , <T_9> mumbai <T_3> flew in <T_6> bravo from <T_4> and tobago , <T_5> . <T_0> when <T_7> had to go back <T_1> represent the west <T_2> , they <T_8> him , &quot; when do you have to reach ? &quot;
it &apos;s the <T_0> thing .
b.p. operated very <T_2> and very <T_1> because <T_0> could .
<T_1> makes sense , <T_0> ?
pam <T_1> : <T_2> we can eat <T_0> landscapes
<T_0> have never , ever <T_1> such utter <T_2> .
so , the <T_5> is <T_4> , focused <T_0> and <T_8> build-up <T_3> climax are all replaced <T_2> a <T_1> of attenuated <T_6> that &apos;s sustained by <T_7> sense of apprehension caused by the fog .
so , i wipe <T_1> pigeon manure off <T_0> of the bells , and i <T_2> at it .
<T_2> you see <T_3> cube <T_0> way , behind <T_1> screen , <T_4> boundaries go away .
<T_1> &apos;re facing <T_2> tough <T_0> .
<T_1> &apos;s seen <T_0> hypocrisy .
so <T_2> me show you <T_1> malicious code looks like <T_0> .
and <T_1> keep sending more <T_0> day .
<T_5> we had <T_1> do it the hard <T_2> in the <T_3> days by <T_4> offspring that looked a <T_6> way and then <T_0> them .
there <T_1> also real business <T_0> .
<T_6> &apos;s <T_5> only the <T_3> couple of floors <T_0> you really <T_1> , and <T_2> rest of it is just <T_4> postcards .
in <T_1> , <T_4> know that <T_5> results in sort of <T_2> formalist <T_0> towards trying <T_3> understand how <T_6> works .
and how <T_2> you <T_1> that ? <T_0> we &apos;ve done it before .
<T_0> it worked , <T_1> so i <T_2> .
ahhhh .
<T_3> : the <T_2> came <T_0> started <T_1> me .
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy <T_0> , starting way back <T_2> johnson &amp; amp ; johnson , to run an <T_3> , because the best batteries you could get -- <T_4> watt-hours per kilogram in <T_6> , <T_9> watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium , <T_7> watt-hours <T_5> kilogram in nickel-metal hydride , 60 watt-hours <T_8> kilogram in lithium , 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every <T_1> of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars .
in <T_1> last <T_0> years , for <T_3> , the u.s. protected 340,000 square <T_2> of ocean <T_5> national <T_4> .
so what <T_7> &apos;re looking at here is <T_4> heat image of <T_2> system , and <T_3> you can see <T_5> emerging from the <T_0> is <T_1> cool <T_6> .
there you can <T_0> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_1> in at 27 and a half <T_2> .
<T_1> the <T_5> dots , <T_0> made it easy <T_4> gave <T_3> a reason <T_2> act now .
why would somebody -- and this <T_6> is <T_2> lucid and <T_1> in all other respects , but <T_4> he sees <T_7> mother , <T_0> delusion kicks in and <T_5> , <T_8> &apos;s not <T_3> .
i &apos;m just <T_1> back <T_2> forth ; i &apos;m not getting <T_0> .
<T_3> does <T_0> government of uganda budget spend <T_2> percent of <T_1> own revenue ?
and <T_2> soon <T_0> whole population is actually composed of <T_1> new <T_3> .
<T_1> you know <T_2> many people <T_4> would have gotten <T_3> we put up flyers <T_0> the laundromat ?
<T_1> tree plantation <T_0> borneo .
<T_3> &apos;m trying to <T_9> you <T_6> since the past <T_5> years , the <T_4> rate of growth <T_2> the <T_0> has moved from about 2.5 percent <T_1> about <T_8> percent <T_7> annum .
<T_1> it &apos;s really <T_0> .
<T_1> she spoke <T_3> the <T_0> for <T_2> moment , <T_4> then she started getting tears in her <T_5> .
now this became <T_1> new secret <T_4> , <T_8> the first <T_3> i did as a <T_9> was call my twin sister -- <T_0> have an identical twin sister named <T_6> -- <T_5> tell <T_7> , i &apos;m playing a game to heal <T_2> brain , and i want you to play with me .
<T_5> so <T_3> kind of <T_4> space that <T_1> take <T_2> from is my <T_0> desk .
this <T_4> your life . <T_3> is ... <T_0> is ... <T_2> is <T_1> life .
<T_0> sexy <T_1> that ?
<T_4> a little boy , and through my teenage <T_2> , i became <T_1> fascinated by <T_0> diversity of <T_3> .
and then <T_2> next <T_3> , <T_1> would come , and i would do <T_0> again .
that &apos;s not really what <T_0> mean .
<T_6> &apos;s this <T_0> concentration of <T_1> , the <T_4> concentration <T_9> consciousness , awareness , an absolute <T_2> of <T_5> and <T_8> that defines the <T_7> attributes of <T_3> .
they &apos;re in <T_2> joint <T_1> with <T_0> .
<T_1> leo tolstoy was <T_7> years <T_4> , his brother nikolay came <T_2> him <T_0> said <T_5> had engraved the secret to <T_8> happiness <T_3> a little green stick , which he had hidden in <T_6> ravine on the family &apos;s estate <T_9> russia .
so he starts to tell them , and he &apos;s like , &quot; <T_5> , this is very important here . you know , when you &apos;re needing <T_0> knots , it &apos;s going to be , you know , everything &apos;s going to be happening at the same time , <T_8> &apos;s going to be -- you &apos;re going to have all this information coming at you , there &apos;s going to be organs getting in the way , it &apos;s going to be <T_2> , and it &apos;s <T_7> very important that you be able <T_3> do these beyond <T_4> nature , each hand , left hand , <T_9> hand , you have <T_6> be <T_1> to do them without seeing your fingers . &quot;
<T_8> receive a <T_3> from the <T_4> , and three <T_1> later , <T_5> pilot was <T_0> over the <T_2> and <T_6> this <T_7> .
there &apos;s <T_2> person , right <T_1> . the <T_3> is waving to <T_0> .
it &apos;s only sold by <T_8> phalanx of street hawkers <T_4> run around the <T_6> of lagos <T_7> bus stations <T_9> in <T_1> jams <T_2> sell it as a <T_3> , <T_0> it &apos;s been sold that way <T_5> 40 years .
it &apos;s just going up through <T_0> roof .
so <T_2> is <T_0> friend . fear <T_1> an <T_3> .
how <T_3> things going to be working out <T_1> him <T_0> the next <T_2> or <T_4> ?
we <T_2> longlines <T_3> have one million <T_0> two million <T_1> .
and here &apos;s how <T_0> tell .
and <T_0> , sometimes i &apos;m swayed by <T_1> .
this <T_6> figured out <T_0> to get the <T_3> to draw <T_1> two <T_2> at once : you know , you , pen , do <T_4> , <T_7> you , pen , do <T_5> .
&quot; <T_0> is this ?

<T_3> a <T_2> is three billion <T_4> -- <T_0> &apos;s the <T_1> .
and <T_5> is <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> , <T_2> think <T_4> &apos;ve <T_1> that , already , haven &apos;t we ?
silk , <T_2> its self-assembly process , <T_3> like a <T_0> for <T_1> matter .
<T_0> , adam <T_1> eve would probably act <T_2> .
<T_7> this <T_0> of <T_8> -- this kind of <T_6> , ultraviolet , <T_4> light <T_1> -- we were never going to <T_3> through <T_2> gold ground <T_5> .
these <T_0> cells <T_5> nerve cells , and <T_2> now , <T_4> we see and understand <T_8> we &apos;re looking at , <T_9> brains <T_7> our nerve cells are actually doing <T_6> right now . they &apos;re not just <T_1> . they &apos;re moving <T_3> making new connections , and that &apos;s what happens when we learn .
<T_0> we &apos;ll <T_2> learn a <T_1> .

therefore <T_8> of you , in the buddhist <T_0> , in <T_1> previous <T_5> , although <T_3> don &apos;t remember it and <T_9> do i , have been my <T_2> -- for which <T_4> do <T_7> for <T_6> trouble i caused you .

<T_5> iyengar : <T_3> , <T_9> &apos;s funny that <T_4> should ask that because one of the <T_1> that &apos;s <T_8> about <T_7> blind is <T_0> actually get a different vantage point when you <T_6> the way sighted <T_2> make choices .

that <T_7> you are a leader <T_1> any area -- in <T_8> , <T_2> politics , <T_4> sports , in <T_6> , <T_0> academics , <T_3> any area -- you don &apos;t own it ; you are a <T_5> of <T_9> .
<T_0> &apos;s called <T_1> .
<T_6> we &apos;ve <T_2> as <T_5> tools we uniquely make to pull <T_1> resources out of <T_0> environment kind <T_4> just blow up in <T_3> face .
we <T_7> 12 billion light-years <T_8> the edge <T_5> &apos;s <T_1> guess no one can <T_6> say <T_0> &apos;s true but <T_9> know <T_4> i will always be <T_3> you well , <T_2> &apos;s nice .
&quot; i <T_1> so <T_2> ; <T_3> feel <T_0> good . &quot;
but <T_1> pay <T_0> school .
so , i &apos;ll <T_2> about <T_0> composition , even though <T_1> don &apos;t <T_3> where to <T_4> .
<T_3> need to <T_1> doing things <T_2> lula , president <T_0> brazil .
<T_0> believe <T_1> could .
<T_1> they &apos;ll actually <T_0> you money <T_2> those computers .
<T_0> the crowd , <T_1> in the <T_3> , dial up the <T_2> .
how <T_1> would you <T_7> about <T_4> a pencil from work <T_2> , compared to <T_3> bad would you <T_0> about taking 10 <T_6> from <T_5> petty <T_8> box ?
i <T_6> the warden <T_7> i wanted to <T_3> a <T_9> biking <T_1> in <T_4> place and <T_5> basically i wanted to take the <T_2> from <T_0> to <T_8> .
but , there is <T_7> part of <T_1> -- <T_0> the difficult thing is , at the <T_4> time , not <T_5> make a uniform statement <T_3> africa , not to <T_8> to <T_6> ideas of why it <T_9> like this , on <T_2> hand .
so this <T_1> the bit i &apos;m really <T_0> of .
<T_1> exactly four <T_3> after , the <T_0> , <T_2> of them are <T_4> there .
he &apos;s just really hoping that boots <T_0> and , you know ...
<T_0> &apos;re <T_3> fascinating . <T_1> they &apos;re like that all <T_4> the <T_2> .
<T_1> . we don &apos;t <T_2> a lasting <T_0> impact .
<T_8> &apos;m also guessing <T_3> most <T_9> you don &apos;t <T_5> speak <T_0> -- which <T_7> sort of sad if <T_1> think about it , as <T_4> &apos;s now <T_2> most represented language on the <T_6> .
the psychiatrist <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> right , <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> . &quot;
<T_1> anybody <T_0> anything but <T_2> left one being <T_3> ?
<T_0> . let &apos;s leave <T_1> .
<T_1> it is a <T_0> edifying form <T_2> instant <T_3> .
they want <T_2> actions they can engage <T_0> , and <T_1> their <T_6> , <T_9> know it &apos;s <T_8> to take <T_5> responsibility and invest in more <T_4> to each other <T_3> to the <T_7> .
<T_1> take our <T_2> , we make them shut <T_4> brains down , and then we <T_3> , &quot; <T_0> . &quot;
and <T_9> we <T_2> them <T_6> variety of <T_3> about the rightness or <T_8> of certain acts , what <T_1> also found was <T_5> being reminded that <T_7> ought <T_0> wash their <T_4> made them more morally conservative .
<T_3> : there &apos;s <T_1> also <T_2> really <T_0> great about this .
<T_3> . is there any possible way that i <T_0> know <T_4> seven digit <T_1> you <T_6> ? <T_2> &quot; <T_5> . &quot;
<T_0> here &apos;s the behind <T_2> scenes , a <T_1> of little shots here .
<T_1> piles <T_0> humus .
<T_0> is the <T_1> .
and <T_8> said , <T_0> of all , let <T_3> do the calculation <T_4> that <T_7> , bottom <T_6> , which is related to <T_1> , <T_2> has an <T_5> pentagon inserted into <T_9> molecule .
so , what &apos;s great about this <T_4> it isn &apos;t just a <T_8> , more <T_6> way to get <T_9> in <T_0> real <T_1> , but there are times <T_3> actually using this medium allows you to be able to <T_7> information in a <T_5> that <T_2> never before possible .
and <T_1> tried <T_2> they <T_0> .
so , i went down <T_9> my <T_3> , and <T_4> molded it <T_8> i cast it <T_0> resin , because <T_1> the <T_5> , then , <T_6> could absolutely get the <T_2> smooth <T_7> .
and i <T_0> in a dark place for a <T_1> time , unable to create .
i am <T_3> us <T_4> balance <T_5> idea of our <T_2> vulnerability <T_6> the <T_1> notion of <T_0> of what is possible .
<T_1> can think of <T_9> nagging inner voice <T_3> sort of the brain &apos;s equivalent of the <T_6> church , if <T_4> &apos;re an <T_7> like me , <T_5> the super-ego , <T_2> you &apos;re freudian , or <T_0> mother , <T_8> you &apos;re jewish .
it &apos;s <T_1> with us <T_0> .
<T_0> we like <T_6> or <T_8> , <T_5> u.s. <T_3> the <T_7> market for <T_2> substances in the world , accounting for more than <T_1> of global <T_4> .
<T_8> it turned out <T_1> most people <T_5> &apos;t come back , because it <T_3> . <T_7> every once <T_2> a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , <T_4> he &apos;d <T_9> back . and <T_0> dad had a third <T_6> .
<T_2> amazing <T_1> i &apos;ve <T_4> is nothing can change <T_5> a big <T_6> without the <T_0> of a <T_3> .
whilst <T_4> was at <T_2> , we discussed <T_0> idea of <T_1> maybe technology , something <T_5> wasn &apos;t either switched <T_3> or <T_6> , but in <T_7> .
<T_4> continued <T_0> evolve and <T_3> in one <T_2> or another on more <T_6> sophisticated <T_1> , <T_5> only five years ago .
it &apos;s like a <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> . <T_0> &apos;s <T_3> an <T_2> .
<T_2> is an <T_1> way outside the national <T_0> , stretching <T_3> into <T_5> these very <T_4> lands .
as a <T_6> , this <T_5> , which had already sold out , every <T_7> person <T_4> that 800-seat <T_2> , <T_8> for 10 <T_0> , <T_1> a decision <T_9> keep <T_3> money .
back in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , when <T_9> was growing up , <T_5> girls were <T_6> to be kind <T_3> thoughtful and pretty <T_1> gentle <T_0> soft , and <T_8> were supposed to <T_7> that were sort of shadowy -- really not <T_4> clear what we were <T_2> to be .
<T_0> must say <T_5> before <T_1> went to <T_2> u.s. i didn &apos;t <T_4> identify as <T_3> .
but <T_2> may not <T_3> that <T_5> tried to perform <T_0> in the brain , noninvasively , <T_1> focused ultrasound <T_4> the &apos; 50s .
<T_2> moral <T_1> is on the <T_0> .
so she <T_1> just one <T_2> the millions who are <T_0> .
<T_0> . <T_1> &apos;s try that .
i &apos;m <T_1> , &quot; <T_0> , <T_2> &apos;m <T_3> . &quot;
so <T_0> was a <T_1> effort .
as <T_2> can see , <T_3> that &apos;s <T_4> , it &apos;s in <T_1> middle <T_0> it .
and <T_0> you get <T_6> the <T_5> , <T_1> subject of <T_8> of those &quot; go green &quot; <T_3> , and on the <T_4> of a house they <T_2> make no <T_7> at all .
so even though <T_5> were <T_8> it <T_0> we <T_3> one-year contracts -- you <T_7> &apos;t teach , <T_1> you don &apos;t want to teach , <T_4> &apos;t get to be at <T_2> school with <T_6> kids <T_9>
and <T_0> lets <T_3> put everything else in <T_4> to <T_1> you &apos;ve <T_2> told me .
here &apos;s something that <T_0> me <T_1> .
so <T_7> , you can <T_4> products from <T_1> web -- <T_3> you would have <T_0> your <T_5> , like <T_2> , <T_6> , lemon squeezers .
now <T_3> &apos;t run <T_1> . <T_2> had something <T_0> by your pants pocket .
<T_0> we <T_1> &apos;t know how <T_3> brains do <T_2> , we &apos;re <T_4> in a position , so far , to build a conscious machine .
government <T_1> became sideline <T_0> .
<T_0> that this is <T_1> to do this is not <T_2> .
<T_2> i never became <T_4> designer . <T_1> , <T_6> , <T_5> , no . never <T_0> . <T_3> even close .
and <T_1> , <T_0> had to go and play <T_2> t20 world <T_3> , you see .
<T_2> system <T_1> the four significant <T_0> .
my <T_0> leg got caught up in <T_2> wheel well -- <T_1> it around .
and while i <T_8> , <T_2> &apos;ll <T_5> mention that here <T_0> &apos;re using <T_3> for <T_1> , <T_6> you <T_7> equally well use this on the <T_4> , for <T_9> reality .
<T_5> , as <T_1> as it <T_2> to change the <T_0> , it is more important <T_4> change <T_3> laws .
and some <T_3> , artificially <T_5> supercomputers will analyze <T_4> images <T_2> human <T_6> to <T_0> them in <T_1> connectome .
let &apos;s have a department of war , and a department <T_1> something <T_0> .
it actually <T_6> the largest <T_4> mammal <T_2> on <T_0> planet , <T_3> hundreds of thousands of these <T_5> being killed <T_1> year .
they <T_1> off pretty close <T_0> .
it &apos;s <T_0> awesome <T_2> . <T_1> &apos;t work .
some <T_0> worked , <T_1> things didn &apos;t .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> weak form of the <T_2> .
<T_0> are <T_1> anthers of a <T_9> , <T_2> done so that <T_6> the unsuspecting insect lands <T_8> it , the anther flips <T_3> and whops it on the <T_7> with a great load of <T_5> that it then goes to another <T_4> with .
thank <T_0> .
<T_1> is playing a <T_0> .
<T_0> so this is what <T_1> did .
<T_7> thirdly , <T_4> need to be able to make <T_5> break <T_1> bonds . <T_2> again this <T_3> important <T_6> life transforms resources from the <T_0> into building <T_9> so it <T_8> maintain itself .
in 1958 , <T_0> the soviets put up <T_1> , <T_4> was &quot; <T_2> &apos;s the <T_3> of america . &quot;
water &apos;s pumped from <T_4> lake and is <T_7> and <T_2> as a <T_0> mist through <T_3> array <T_8> high-pressure fog <T_5> , 35,000 of them . and a weather station is <T_1> the <T_6> .
designer emily pilloton moved to <T_7> bertie <T_3> , in <T_9> carolina , to engage in a bold experiment of design-led <T_0> transformation . she &apos;s teaching a design-build <T_5> called studio h that engages high schoolers &apos; minds and bodies <T_2> bringing smart design <T_8> new <T_6> to the <T_1> county in the <T_4> .
<T_0> you .
<T_2> upon a time <T_0> &apos;s this happy <T_1> bacterium .
this <T_3> up to <T_5> of pieces of <T_1> data on <T_0> well we <T_4> or <T_2> .
<T_0> this is <T_2> number <T_1> people .
<T_2> , and so therefore why would <T_0> when you were <T_1> ?
and so you <T_7> see <T_6> and insects and <T_0> of locomotives <T_2> all of <T_1> , <T_8> you &apos;re really <T_3> involved ; <T_5> &apos;re <T_4> talked to .
wow .
and not only that -- he would <T_5> pick <T_9> leafy <T_0> and <T_2> the <T_4> -- modifying an object <T_1> make <T_3> suitable for <T_8> specific <T_7> -- the <T_6> of tool-making .
<T_2> &apos;s think <T_3> cities are <T_0> people , lots of people together <T_1>
<T_1> &apos;s so <T_0> .
&quot; you want <T_1> frozen <T_0> ?
<T_0> &apos;s <T_1> intensely , intensely <T_2> process .
don &apos;t <T_0> it to leave me <T_1> .
and we released <T_3> film <T_0> the same <T_1> that the <T_5> was <T_6> the <T_2> of the <T_4> against women <T_7> .
i <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s a <T_2> complicated <T_4> . someone <T_0> control all of this . &quot;
rebecca <T_2> : <T_1> &apos;s take <T_0> the internet !
<T_3> i do make some <T_1> , i &apos;ll have one <T_0> for <T_2> .
here a community camp just organized by <T_2> community themselves , where <T_1> find <T_0> place , <T_3> volunteers , and then we &apos;ll do <T_6> part . <T_7> know , check their vision , and then you have doctors <T_5> you find out what the problem is and then determine what <T_9> testing should be done , <T_8> then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses , <T_4> check for glaucoma .
mo <T_1> said <T_5> a debate we were at <T_4> he <T_2> one <T_0> when <T_3> will be giving aid .
unbearable psychological <T_1> down on <T_0> .
<T_2> is <T_3> such thing as an hiv <T_0> in <T_1> .
moore &apos;s <T_1> made <T_0> cheap ; <T_2> cheap <T_4> can <T_8> the life <T_7> an <T_3> insect and decide <T_5> up <T_6> thumbs down .
<T_1> want <T_0> match the hour-by-hour power <T_2> .
<T_3> scientist could <T_5> that in 2007 , <T_2> , <T_1> could be <T_4> a <T_0> .
<T_4> you <T_3> see <T_0> i &apos;m down on <T_2> , with <T_1> haircut like that .
<T_0> more <T_5> that , the <T_1> world , or <T_3> , <T_2> both ambiguous and <T_4> .
<T_2> got <T_6> of the <T_1> , and i <T_0> , and it was a <T_8> town . i did a 360 <T_4> , and <T_9> became one <T_3> the most surreal <T_7> i &apos;ve ever <T_5> .
<T_0> we <T_4> people become <T_1> , <T_3> do men get <T_2> ?
<T_1> no vehicles <T_0> need oil .
<T_5> actually take the <T_0> , we use very <T_6> detergents , and we , by using these <T_3> detergents , we <T_2> all the cells <T_4> of the <T_1> .
<T_2> it <T_0> to require reading , <T_1> and <T_3> ?
similarly <T_0> oxygen <T_2> other <T_4> supplies are really a luxury <T_1> can <T_6> be out of stock for <T_5> or even <T_3> year .
<T_1> it may seem kind of <T_3> that <T_6> a thing can actually be <T_4> , <T_2> it does <T_0> all the <T_5> .
<T_1> know from three different studies <T_4> three different types <T_7> pain <T_5> a saltwater injection is <T_2> more effective treatment for pain <T_3> taking a sugar pill , taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- <T_0> because the injection or the <T_6> do anything <T_8> to <T_9> body , but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .
<T_3> do <T_1> go to find out how to <T_2> an <T_0> ?
<T_1> we <T_7> at the delays , it <T_6> between <T_3> and <T_5> years to put up <T_2> nuclear power plant <T_4> planning to <T_0> .
<T_5> i <T_3> started talking <T_7> the bradley , petrie , dumais <T_1> that you just saw -- i &apos;ll go <T_8> to it , <T_9> one -- <T_0> said that <T_4> was <T_6> filling-in <T_2> there .
<T_2> ultimate <T_4> of <T_3> is to ask them <T_0> to <T_1> .
like <T_1> , <T_3> move it slightly <T_0> the right or to the <T_2> .
and <T_1> you <T_0> much .
i &apos;m going <T_3> go way out <T_5> a limb and say that <T_4> is the most <T_1> paper ever published <T_0> the <T_2> of <T_7> in <T_6> .
<T_2> coincidence <T_7> the <T_5> of the <T_0> nation <T_3> earth is half-kenyan , <T_4> raised in <T_1> , has <T_6> chinese-canadian brother-in-law .
because <T_5> know <T_7> our experience of <T_3> world <T_4> of ourselves within it is <T_0> in the <T_6> -- <T_1> happens after <T_2> .
<T_2> north pole is slap bang <T_0> the middle of the <T_5> , so i &apos;m traveling over <T_4> frozen <T_1> of the arctic <T_3> .
i &apos;m <T_4> sure this is <T_8> improvement , or a <T_7> idea , because , like , if <T_1> don &apos;t spend quite <T_3> time in <T_0> of your computer , you can now get a plate in <T_6> keyboard , so there &apos;s <T_2> more faking it -- that you don &apos;t really sit <T_5> your desk all day and <T_9> and work anyway .
<T_4> so he <T_0> around <T_6> room , and <T_5> as he &apos;s <T_1> the diner , he first-names <T_2> everybody he &apos;s <T_3> met .
<T_0> &apos;t <T_2> get them out the <T_1> -- and i &apos;m being serious -- can &apos;t even get them there . <T_3> .
<T_2> motivation , <T_3> , <T_1> and purpose , in a knockout . let me <T_0> up .
<T_0> had to take a <T_1> , shrink <T_2> down , inject it <T_3> the <T_4> .
right <T_3> , dan &apos;s going to <T_1> something <T_0> actually <T_2> .
do you have <T_0> kind of perverted <T_1> from this ?
<T_0> : <T_3> , <T_2> , is there any way <T_1> see through it ?
<T_4> is the posterior <T_1> , where <T_2> muscles are going to be <T_5> , <T_0> he &apos;s going <T_6> be pacing <T_3> .
<T_0> neuron <T_2> connected via synapses to <T_1> to 10,000 <T_4> neurons in <T_3> brain .
forty-seven out <T_0> those <T_2> were <T_1> .
the <T_4> was <T_1> 75 <T_3> hydrogen , 25 <T_2> helium . it still <T_0> today .
<T_1> at the <T_2> , she was <T_0> .
<T_6> one study , <T_0> we ran in <T_5> , san <T_2> , <T_1> brought seven- <T_9> nine-year-old anglo- <T_7> asian-american children <T_4> the laboratory , and we divided <T_8> up into <T_3> groups .
ladies <T_3> gentlemen , <T_1> you <T_0> much . <T_2> .
<T_3> based on this , i <T_2> back to the national <T_1> foundation <T_4> said , &quot; <T_5> is what <T_0> will discover . &quot;
<T_3> , <T_2> started this company <T_1> solar <T_0> .
so <T_0> one <T_5> like a sound <T_6> , so <T_4> can <T_2> it , and <T_3> just love these <T_1> noises .
everybody points <T_4> laughs , <T_2> they <T_0> , &quot; <T_5> tried <T_1> a fifth time <T_3> it still <T_6> &apos;t work .
<T_1> is a picture <T_5> took in 2005 , <T_8> on <T_0> over the <T_2> in <T_3> , and <T_9> me it &apos;s a symbolic picture of <T_4> open future for <T_6> young <T_7> .
<T_0> have superstar bankers .
<T_2> few <T_0> things . here <T_3> my <T_1> .
<T_2> is <T_0> than the performance of many <T_1> countries .
but <T_6> idea <T_1> that <T_3> ants are in there , <T_7> each <T_4> is experiencing a <T_0> flow <T_8> ants <T_5> it -- a <T_9> of contacts with <T_2> ants .
<T_2> thing was designed <T_1> years <T_3> gagarin first flew <T_0> space in 1961 .
why do we all follow <T_2> line <T_0> the <T_1> ?
let &apos;s make it concrete .
but <T_6> &apos;s believed <T_7> the oldest living <T_1> are perhaps 2,500 years old -- <T_2> the <T_0> of <T_3> parthenon -- <T_9> it &apos;s also <T_4> that there may be <T_5> trees that are <T_8> than that .
frigoris ? <T_0> is the <T_4> . <T_3> could <T_1> there <T_2> day .
a <T_2> judge has a <T_3> with <T_0> human <T_1> a computer .
<T_2> &apos;t it <T_7> that my 48-year-old <T_6> is forever losing <T_5> way <T_0> in the <T_1> , <T_4> the <T_3> ? &quot;
there &apos;s a <T_2> to <T_4> from <T_3> landbanking programs in cities <T_0> flint , <T_1> .
it &apos;s really prompted by a <T_8> i had with <T_3> wonderful woman <T_0> maybe <T_4> people <T_7> never <T_1> of ; she &apos;s called gillian lynne -- have <T_6> heard of <T_2> ? some have . she &apos;s a choreographer and <T_5> knows <T_9> work .
in the early days of this modern markets <T_0> , the <T_4> institutions worked out how <T_2> could leverage <T_3> buying power , their back office processes , their <T_8> , their networks <T_6> shape these <T_9> markets <T_5> would create all <T_1> new <T_7> .
in <T_0> cultures , <T_3> paint themselves <T_1> &quot; <T_2> of the <T_4> . &quot;
this <T_0> is <T_2> pretty <T_1> .

the <T_0> one ?
<T_1> really , <T_0> &apos;s pretty <T_2> .
<T_1> kim : <T_3> family i lost <T_2> north korea . <T_0> the <T_4> i <T_5> .
<T_0> : ambition to be a <T_1> .
<T_1> a few rise to the <T_0> .
now , in a <T_7> with so many it people , i do have to mention what <T_4> &apos;m not going to <T_6> about , and that is <T_1> your field is <T_0> that has learned an enormous amount from living <T_3> , on the software side . so <T_8> &apos;s computers that protect <T_2> , like an <T_9> system , and we &apos;re learning from gene regulation and biological development . and we &apos;re learning from neural <T_5> , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computing .
<T_4> you &apos;ve got <T_5> mosquito <T_9> your <T_8> , anyone coming into <T_2> area <T_0> dengue , mosquito will bite them , mosquito will <T_3> somewhere else , <T_6> else , <T_7> else , <T_1> you &apos;ll get an epidemic .
and <T_1> fly <T_2> the <T_0> volcano .
<T_2> , cooking <T_0> also that we became <T_3> migrant <T_1> .
<T_4> thirdly , <T_0> i <T_3> , most of the <T_2> are very <T_1> because of that .
<T_3> the way it <T_0> is , it <T_1> from the <T_2> .
incentivize <T_2> . <T_1> &apos;s how <T_0> works .
<T_4> &apos;s <T_0> pakistani <T_3> , <T_7> 6,000 <T_6> whom have been killed in <T_5> last <T_2> years alone , <T_1> fair game .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_2> to start with <T_0> examples .
and all that raises , of course , <T_2> question : <T_6> can we learn <T_5> those <T_8> in the green <T_3> who have <T_0> high <T_7> of equity , <T_1> levels of <T_4> , and raised outcomes ?
it &apos;s <T_0> drone . <T_2> is <T_1> drone ?
and if we &apos;re going to solve <T_3> and look at <T_5> world really <T_1> , whether it &apos;s in governance <T_0> business or environmental issues , job <T_4> , <T_7> we <T_8> think <T_2> how to reframe <T_6> problems as having both <T_9> be true .
in <T_2> graduate <T_1> i worked <T_0> my colleague and <T_8> and friend , steve schneider , <T_4> the national center <T_3> atmospheric research , <T_6> on <T_5> change <T_7> .
<T_0> we took it to <T_2> stanford synchrotron <T_3> laboratory <T_4> california , which is a <T_1> .
<T_4> only <T_5> that night <T_1> to <T_6> a meal <T_7> him , and <T_8> night <T_2> also thought of <T_3> else i <T_9> do to honor <T_0> .
<T_3> expect <T_1> from technology <T_0> less from <T_2> other .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_1> described <T_3> species <T_2> bipedal octopus .
<T_0> so this really shifts the <T_6> / <T_2> dynamic , <T_8> a <T_4> house plant <T_5> actually express its <T_3> to <T_7> of <T_1> at the same time .
<T_2> what are the kinds of <T_3> that <T_1> might ask <T_0> ?
they <T_1> around me <T_2> three <T_0> .
mt : well , as a matter of <T_3> , it <T_5> on my sixth <T_6> that i received my <T_0> deck of cards , and ever <T_2> that day , i have traveled around the world <T_9> magic for boys <T_4> girls , men <T_8> women , <T_7> and wives , even kings <T_1> queens .
<T_3> , <T_2> am standing on <T_0> ted stage with <T_1> yo-yo in front of <T_4> .
a <T_0> dance , <T_1> then heads <T_4> in <T_2> particular <T_3> .
<T_0> say , if <T_2> measure the temperature of <T_6> atmosphere , <T_7> isn &apos;t going up -- <T_5> &apos;s not going up at all . we &apos;ve doing it <T_8> carefully now for <T_4> years , from <T_9> , and <T_1> isn &apos;t going <T_3> .
i <T_3> to <T_2> you a little bit about the <T_0> of it , too -- the <T_1> of it .
and <T_1> want to know <T_0> .
thank <T_0> .
and <T_2> &apos;ll walk <T_1> through a <T_0> of those now .
in <T_3> school , there was <T_1> simple <T_2> : to create comfort <T_0> a <T_4> .
photographer <T_2> balog shares <T_1> image sequences <T_0> the <T_6> ice <T_3> , <T_8> network of time-lapse cameras recording <T_7> receding at an alarming rate , <T_4> of the most <T_5> evidence yet <T_9> climate change .
the <T_2> are amongst <T_1> oldest of <T_3> , <T_5> have <T_4> interpreted in many different <T_0> .
<T_2> not very <T_3> . and <T_0> on and <T_1> forth .
<T_0> i enlist <T_4> to <T_1> me get <T_2> cooperation <T_3> started .
<T_2> so , that &apos;s <T_0> we &apos;re going to <T_4> . we &apos;re planning <T_1> permanent <T_5> in <T_3> .
and <T_5> says that <T_1> never would have become <T_6> an <T_3> in <T_4> first place had he <T_0> been too <T_7> to leave <T_2> house <T_8> he was growing up .
<T_2> this <T_0> , a one-centimeter <T_1> .
and <T_5> suspects have <T_9> tracked using <T_3> clothing , certainly <T_2> the u.k. , to within <T_0> area <T_1> &apos;s small enough that you <T_7> send in tracker dogs <T_4> find <T_8> murder <T_6> .
<T_2> people <T_0> not <T_1> much .
and just before <T_4> died at the <T_3> of <T_1> , <T_0> gave me <T_2> gift .
today &apos;s commercial <T_1> worldwide , global commercial launch <T_0> ?
so <T_0> -- this <T_3> the car seat . now watch two <T_1> : watch how <T_6> head <T_9> forward , and <T_7> hits <T_4> knees -- and <T_8> is in the car seat -- and watch <T_5> the <T_2> flies around , in the rebound , up in the air .
and that <T_2> us <T_0> the <T_1> level .
these are <T_0> handmade .
is <T_0> a <T_1> solution ?
so <T_3> example , if someone <T_7> , &quot; my likelihood of <T_4> from <T_0> is about <T_5> percent , &quot; <T_8> we <T_2> , &quot; <T_6> , <T_1> news .
<T_4> , <T_5> really <T_1> about <T_0> because it &apos;s <T_2> the thirtieth anniversary of me <T_3> year .
it has <T_3> the <T_2> value to keep <T_1> universe <T_4> in an <T_0> situation .
how <T_1> genes <T_0> i <T_2> ?
this is what we <T_0> in our <T_1> . &quot;
<T_0> has <T_1> implications .
<T_4> wrote <T_6> book <T_3> , <T_2> think you <T_0> have <T_5> it , called &quot; <T_1> acts ? &quot;
<T_4> 7,000 people <T_5> killed , and the city <T_2> this <T_1> district , all the city was burned in a fire <T_3> the <T_0> .
<T_3> : would you <T_0> to be the president of <T_2> tv <T_1> ?
<T_3> they <T_2> that <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> up , going faster <T_0> faster .
please <T_0> your <T_1> .
i mean , <T_1> grandparents <T_6> these great <T_2> cones , and then your parents <T_5> these odd <T_0> that would <T_4> at odd <T_9> during dinner , and now we <T_8> these little <T_7> that nobody <T_3> .
<T_7> we spend less <T_9> these <T_2> but <T_5> the <T_6> services , <T_0> can take the savings and reinvest them <T_1> high quality residential care <T_4> those <T_3> children with extremely <T_8> needs .
and <T_1> were <T_2> to be <T_3> to show <T_0> here .
it <T_2> finally being <T_0> my <T_1> .
then when <T_0> went <T_7> press , the printer put <T_3> spot gloss on <T_5> ink <T_2> it <T_4> looked <T_1> it was <T_6> .
would <T_1> go to <T_2> and <T_0> and use <T_3> system ? &quot;
and euclid <T_2> , &quot; <T_0> can <T_1> define parallel <T_3> ?
it &apos;s <T_0> : <T_1> position .
<T_0> , <T_2> might be <T_1> ground zero for this .
<T_0> more , <T_6> , <T_2> , <T_7> , <T_4> expectations <T_1> we could have achieved <T_3> to be <T_5> of .
<T_2> is no chance this <T_4> of <T_0> of human life <T_3> be accepted <T_5> else other than <T_1> .
so , what &apos;s <T_3> about this to <T_0> isn &apos;t <T_4> we can train <T_2> to pick up <T_1> .
it <T_0> it more <T_2> , more <T_1> .
<T_0> invented the whole <T_1> of them .
<T_0> epa <T_3> , in <T_1> united states , by volume , <T_4> material <T_2> 25 percent of our <T_5> .
<T_4> anybody here is <T_0> fan of <T_1> original &quot; <T_8> trek , &quot; they <T_5> across an alien ship <T_6> had an ion <T_7> , and <T_2> said , &quot; <T_9> &apos;re <T_3> technically sophisticated .
<T_0> remember <T_1> you <T_2> to me .
so this next part <T_3> really a <T_9> of understanding <T_0> and <T_6> , with <T_8> obvious reference to the <T_7> , <T_1> it &apos;s also time -- where the <T_2> were , <T_4> the balls <T_5> .
roundabouts <T_0> much <T_1> .
what <T_0> it that shapes <T_1> ? and <T_3> live <T_2> a therapy culture .
the international <T_3> still <T_0> &apos;t found a <T_5> to <T_2> the pressure necessary <T_1> stop this <T_4> .
but <T_2> can <T_0> some natural <T_3> and year-round <T_1> control .
<T_1> , so <T_3> &apos;d like <T_0> to take a <T_2> away from this .
it &apos;s therefore <T_2> that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct <T_4> closely allied to <T_3> gorilla <T_8> chimpanzee , and as these <T_0> species are now <T_7> &apos;s <T_9> allies , it &apos;s somewhat more probable that our <T_1> lived on the <T_5> continent <T_6> elsewhere . &quot;
<T_1> really miss <T_6> era , you know , <T_0> you could go <T_3> for a soiree <T_4> see a <T_2> computer get <T_5> to you .
<T_0> live <T_3> a digital <T_2> , <T_1> we &apos;re fairly analog <T_4> .
nine months later , after <T_3> day <T_7> snot <T_4> , i <T_1> the <T_5> blind date <T_2> my life <T_0> a seven and a half <T_6> elephant <T_8> kanchi .
sometimes it <T_0> you what <T_1> shouldn &apos;t <T_2> .
so , <T_1> a <T_6> real <T_7> , <T_2> believe <T_3> we , as an <T_5> community , should get organized <T_0> complete <T_4> task .
i wish <T_0> had <T_3> wishes <T_2> three is what i &apos;ve got and <T_1> they are .
the <T_0> is made <T_2> of <T_1> basic sources .
can you <T_0> raise the <T_1> ?
they &apos;re <T_7> building <T_3> on <T_5> model <T_1> we invented <T_9> the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , <T_2> is really obsolete , i would <T_8> , and there are hundreds and hundreds of <T_0> cities that are being <T_6> all over the <T_4> .
<T_2> all these <T_3> in common <T_8> these materials are structured at the <T_9> , <T_1> they have <T_6> dna sequence <T_5> codes for a protein sequence that gives <T_0> the blueprint to be able to build <T_4> really wonderful <T_7> .
<T_8> science writers and editors -- i shouldn &apos;t say science writers , i should say <T_9> who write about <T_4> -- <T_1> editors <T_0> sit down over <T_3> couple of beers , after a hard day of work , and start talking <T_6> some of these <T_2> perceptions <T_5> how the universe <T_7> .
this family <T_0> statement <T_2> a <T_1> way to identify what it is that <T_3> do right .
<T_0> is no <T_6> cure , but <T_5> medicine is saving millions <T_1> lives <T_3> year , and <T_2> can do the <T_4> thing .
<T_1> was <T_3> hard , you know , <T_2> impose <T_0> authority .
one is <T_4> , <T_2> associated <T_5> it is a <T_1> of <T_3> and a sense of <T_0> .
and <T_4> we think about <T_6> classic <T_8> of the <T_7> in the lab , we have <T_1> image -- you know , they &apos;re pouring <T_3> the microscope , and <T_5> see <T_2> in the <T_0> sample .
<T_0> : <T_1> , it &apos;s <T_2> good setup . that &apos;s a <T_3> setup .
now <T_1> hindsight , it <T_5> actually <T_6> for some things , like mixing a can of paint <T_0> shaking <T_3> polaroid , but at the <T_2> this was <T_4> doomsday .
<T_0> that &apos;s not a <T_1> case <T_2> history .
<T_1> when people ask <T_0> kind of question , they neglect <T_5> , <T_4> is that <T_3> are really <T_6> , unlike <T_2> .
and <T_1> interesting thing <T_0> that <T_2> you <T_4> the <T_5> , you change <T_3> three-dimensional folding .
<T_1> new chaos theory is already <T_2> , <T_0> ?
<T_0> , this <T_5> we <T_6> , this <T_2> natural tendency we <T_7> , towards isolation , towards keeping <T_4> ourselves , crashes head <T_1> into our <T_3> world .
it <T_9> out <T_0> -- len <T_3> up in long <T_5> and <T_7> played football <T_1> watched football , <T_6> played bridge -- <T_2> is in the bottom <T_4> percent of what <T_8> call positive affectivities .
their <T_4> became the art <T_2> i wrote <T_1> onto <T_3> revolving <T_0> .
<T_0> &apos;s one <T_1> of the form and <T_2> .
and <T_0> &apos;s really the <T_1> of my <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_0> sincere <T_2> , <T_4> they take it <T_3> seriously .
google <T_1> : อร ่ <T_0> 9 : mmm , อร ่ <T_2> .
<T_3> is <T_2> strange <T_0> me , <T_5> i &apos;m not used to doing this : <T_1> usually stand on the other <T_4> of the <T_9> , and <T_7> i &apos;m feeling the <T_6> i put other <T_8> into . and it &apos;s hard ...
<T_2> was actually sexually assaulted <T_5> boot camp <T_4> went on to co-organize a <T_0> called the <T_1> women &apos;s <T_3> network .
<T_1> , get in touch <T_0> making <T_2> sound -- create sound .
in <T_3> , they <T_6> 300,000 <T_5> , <T_4> 330,000 <T_1> , out of which , 135,000 were in <T_2> , 9,000 were in <T_0> .
<T_0> , bottom-up materials actually exist <T_1> .
as removed as we the dominant <T_5> may <T_0> from a <T_1> in <T_3> , or <T_2> series of <T_4> treaties 150 <T_7> ago , i still have to ask you the question , how should <T_8> feel about <T_6> statistics <T_9> today ?
<T_3> &apos;ll help my <T_2> . <T_1> &apos;ll do something for my <T_0> , maybe .
then <T_7> minute , i &apos;m thinking , &apos; <T_6> &apos;t do this . <T_1> is wrong . &apos; my buddy says , &apos; <T_3> &apos;mon , <T_8> &apos;s do this . &apos; i <T_4> , &apos; let &apos;s do this . &apos; &quot; and those <T_5> words , <T_9> &apos;s going to remember , <T_2> the next thing he knows , he hears <T_0> pop .
poetry .
what &apos;s happening <T_0> the <T_1> ?
<T_5> the key one <T_2> is the <T_4> , <T_0> we can team up the encoder <T_1> the <T_3> transducer .
and <T_2> reason it <T_0> cold <T_1> because <T_3> evaporates 25 times <T_4> than <T_5> .
<T_1> could doing such a <T_2> thing like <T_0> and not <T_4> make a <T_3> ?
he <T_2> me <T_1> the world is wasting <T_3> of <T_0> on this .
well <T_1> &apos;m going to say <T_0> .
<T_0> forget about all of <T_3> new middle-class frustrations <T_2> disappointments , and <T_4> feel <T_1> millionaires .
we <T_2> certain <T_1> harder and easier to <T_0> .
<T_6> effect happens in <T_9> air , it &apos;s a corrupting <T_1> of <T_5> sound -- <T_7> ultrasound in this <T_2> -- <T_3> &apos;s emitted , but <T_8> &apos;s so <T_0> that you can produce <T_4> precise audio out of that effect .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> first year <T_0> a new high school <T_2> teacher , and i &apos;m so <T_4> .
i was <T_1> next to <T_8> at <T_2> the other day , and <T_6> were saying <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> great image <T_0> the <T_7> sitting outside william <T_4> .
so <T_1> , for <T_0> , <T_3> hydrogen-generating <T_2> .
out <T_2> this , a little <T_1> box -- form <T_0> .
and <T_2> want to be clear to mention that <T_8> open government revolution is <T_3> about privatizing government , because in many cases what it <T_4> do when <T_5> have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive <T_9> better policy <T_7> the regulations <T_0> the <T_6> and litigation-oriented strategies by <T_1> we make policy today .
i <T_0> about compassion .
&quot; <T_0> time . &quot;
so all <T_1> things have aroused <T_0> huge outcry from <T_2> internet .
my <T_1> started in england with <T_2> clean slate <T_0> the silence <T_3> immigrant <T_4> .
but <T_1> &apos;m <T_2> really sure <T_3> their assistance is <T_5> being channeled in <T_4> right <T_0> .
that &apos;s how i ended up in <T_2> , because <T_0> let my <T_1> be <T_3> .
when <T_0> slow it down 50 times <T_1> see how <T_3> leg is hitting <T_2> simulated <T_4> .
<T_5> know it <T_1> &apos;t anger <T_0> made me stop <T_3> heart <T_4> the <T_2> fell .
the <T_7> thing is <T_4> actually give you <T_9> solutions <T_6> the price <T_1> one ; you get the <T_8> one and <T_5> you <T_2> &apos;t <T_0> that , how about the <T_3> one ?
little <T_0> , especially , are attracted <T_1> colorful packaging <T_3> plastic <T_2> .
and <T_1> means that , maybe <T_5> we tweak <T_3> a <T_6> bit , <T_4> can <T_0> the health <T_2> longevity <T_7> people .
<T_2> he <T_0> , &quot; <T_3> &apos;m not a <T_1> . &quot;
<T_5> &apos;s <T_0> woman with a <T_1> being treated <T_2> the <T_3> drug <T_6> avastin , which is <T_4> approved <T_7>
<T_1> category <T_2> online <T_0> .
so <T_4> important biomimicry <T_3> is to find <T_1> of bringing <T_2> together in symbiotic <T_0> .
<T_1> dna , tracing a <T_2> maternal line of <T_0> .
so <T_0> never trusted <T_3> , but <T_2> didn &apos;t give <T_1> .
<T_2> you <T_3> , <T_4> had <T_1> fragrant softness , <T_5> it smelled a little bit of <T_0> oil .
girls &apos; brains <T_0> like <T_4> ; <T_1> in their <T_2> is connected to <T_3> else .
so <T_2> example , in the 11th <T_0> , <T_3> liked pieces <T_1> ended like this .
so <T_5> typical <T_4> young adult <T_2> have a span <T_0> about <T_3> or four <T_1> of attention .
<T_3> , <T_0> used to have <T_1> lot of <T_2> .
and <T_1> are <T_0> three <T_2> such letters long .
now , when you &apos;re only six <T_7> old , and <T_5> father comes <T_2> every single night and <T_1> to you -- as i now realize that i , <T_8> excruciating <T_6> , recounted every <T_9> play <T_0> every inning of the <T_3> that had just taken place <T_4> afternoon .
and the <T_5> of <T_1> is <T_2> different , where we see <T_6> group of <T_4> sounds , <T_3> is known <T_7> the <T_0> &quot; r. &quot;
but you <T_1> also talk about <T_0> places .
<T_4> thom <T_8> has <T_1> been one to take <T_7> easy <T_6> , and this whistle-stop tour of the buildings he &apos;s created makes you <T_9> for <T_2> . <T_5> are <T_0> ideas cast in <T_3> form .
<T_1> clearly <T_2> those action <T_0> doesn &apos;t lead <T_3> attention problems .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> savings accounts versus <T_1> debit accounts with no <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;s called &quot; <T_1> on <T_0> . &quot;
<T_8> also allow <T_5> and things <T_9> that , and <T_6> &apos;ve had , <T_3> think , <T_7> really fun <T_0> at <T_4> company , <T_1> helps people work and <T_2> what they &apos;re doing .
i mean , <T_4> to put <T_2> in <T_3> , 27 degrees <T_0> the temperature of <T_1> normal <T_5> .
well , i <T_6> tell you <T_5> this <T_4> that you &apos;re <T_1> here <T_0> &apos;t happen only <T_2> our five-minute <T_3> .
we &apos;d lay on <T_2> of that the soils <T_1> the waters , and <T_0> the <T_3> .
<T_1> europe , a similar <T_0> was not <T_2> .
their <T_0> camp , <T_7> item of <T_1> , <T_2> ferried 885 <T_6> from mcmurdo <T_8> , <T_3> main u.s. supply base <T_4> the coast <T_5> antarctica .
and <T_5> started <T_2> nature , <T_1> i <T_0> these guaymís doing <T_7> in <T_6> , and there just <T_3> to be <T_4> barriers .
and <T_3> folks <T_1> ghana <T_4> about these self-organizing patterns <T_2> would use <T_0> strategically .
why don &apos;t you just <T_0> them ?
<T_0> &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old <T_1> .
<T_0> let me tell <T_1> this <T_2> .
and , &quot; <T_4> noticed <T_0> large stain <T_3> the <T_1> of the <T_2> . &quot;
a <T_4> animal <T_2> a <T_0> kind of model <T_3> a <T_5> , climbing or <T_1> animal .
most <T_2> them don &apos;t <T_1> to go <T_3> to the <T_0> , but <T_4> don &apos;t have the sense of <T_5> .
what i did -- because of the <T_1> skies being <T_3> dull , i made <T_4> light <T_2> that &apos;s perpendicular to <T_0> train station , to the route of the train .
<T_5> get up just a little bit <T_7> every <T_9> -- say <T_3> minutes or <T_6> -- <T_4> they kind of <T_0> all the way around <T_2> clock like this <T_1> the course of <T_8> weeks .
<T_0> social <T_2> environmental <T_6> at the same time <T_5> the <T_3> solution yields great <T_4> , wealth generation and <T_1> security .
but <T_6> &apos;s <T_4> problem which goes <T_9> with this -- that <T_3> is increasingly out of touch with <T_0> world -- and <T_5> is a <T_1> of <T_2> of a <T_8> of the <T_7> .
so instead <T_1> use the jerry <T_0> approach to <T_2> .
in <T_1> case , <T_0> &apos;s wearing simple marker caps <T_3> you <T_2> recognize .
<T_0> three-digit number , sir , <T_1> ?
and you have <T_3> have -- you can &apos;t do a <T_1> pitch <T_0> giving me <T_2> financials .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> hard <T_0> see it , though , <T_1> far away .
now if your <T_1> is <T_5> worse <T_2> your <T_0> , <T_6> on earth are you doing trying <T_3> change <T_4> reality ?
<T_5> teacher <T_4> me <T_2> to <T_0> the under-five-percent of plastics recovered <T_1> our waste <T_3> .
now <T_1> kurdistan <T_0> landlocked .
<T_1> is <T_0> polio vaccine .
the <T_1> to do <T_2> cause <T_0> matter .
in other words , <T_1> fears <T_2> us <T_0> about the <T_3> .
<T_1> is going to be <T_2> turning <T_0> .
<T_3> it doesn &apos;t <T_2> that much <T_0> we &apos;re putting too much <T_1> on that ?
the <T_3> -- they <T_4> now <T_5> big <T_6> but <T_9> are <T_0> far away from our <T_7> , because the <T_2> plain has multiplied , like <T_8> , springboks and <T_1> .
and in <T_1> way <T_0> could find noor , <T_3> hidden <T_2> of afghanistan .
<T_7> phrase &quot; <T_1> is <T_8> &quot; appears <T_0> and again , <T_2> indeed , the whole of the <T_5> is far more <T_6> than <T_3> of us have been led to <T_4> .
as <T_4> age , we <T_3> , <T_5> this <T_1> causes <T_0> for our society , so <T_6> have to <T_2> it .
but <T_3> you give talks to kids , you know , one <T_7> 50 of them , <T_1> light <T_6> goes off , <T_2> they think , &quot; gee , i &apos;d never <T_8> of that , &quot; and <T_0> they go , you know , <T_4> a book <T_9> a magazine <T_5> whatever .
<T_1> went to <T_2> in <T_0> .
<T_1> says <T_4> lot <T_0> her <T_3> who elected <T_2> .
<T_2> it &apos;s a <T_0> that has its structural facet -- <T_5> &apos;s <T_4> to <T_3> with <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s my <T_0> pocket map of <T_2> it &apos;s all <T_1> .
<T_3> the year <T_1> went to <T_5> , my <T_4> actually got a <T_6> with <T_0> non-governmental organization <T_2> irdnc , <T_7> rural development <T_8> nature conservation .
we <T_0> to edit , and <T_5> means we <T_7> delete , and <T_3> means <T_1> get to <T_4> , <T_2> face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not <T_6> little , not <T_9> much <T_8> just right .
so <T_1> all are <T_0> , and <T_2> home .
someone made <T_0> mistake <T_1> so <T_2> can &apos;t do it <T_3> .
dan <T_0> : beware <T_1> of interest
it <T_2> an <T_0> , <T_1> invitation .
<T_0> , abraham <T_1> .
<T_2> lastly , and i think <T_3> most <T_5> , <T_1> should be creating <T_7> that <T_4> into <T_6> i call nature &apos;s <T_0> system .
is <T_1> fun ? is it <T_0> ?
you <T_1> to survey all feet <T_3> extract the <T_2> of <T_0> they work .
<T_3> love <T_0> little bit of <T_4> that comes off <T_1> back of <T_2> tail .
and <T_6> that motivates <T_4> , and what gets <T_8> really <T_3> about <T_0> research , is when i see simple opportunities <T_2> drastically <T_9> that <T_5> and make the <T_1> accessible to a much <T_7> percentage of the population .
so , utilizing <T_0> of these <T_1> to <T_3> individual <T_2> .
<T_3> people had been put in a <T_1> bad situation <T_2> questionable <T_0> .
there <T_4> no <T_2> to cover <T_0> pain , <T_1> what she <T_3> to change <T_5> this society .
<T_1> mises <T_0> this distinction .
and here <T_2> an image of <T_4> page <T_0> in <T_1> different wavebands of <T_3> .
we don &apos;t <T_0> the details of <T_5> this <T_7> , <T_6> we do <T_3> then that <T_1> genes can impact <T_2> lifespan of <T_4> .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
<T_1> kiss ; they <T_3> ; <T_0> hold <T_2> .
because for those of <T_5> who <T_1> in <T_3> , or in <T_0> democracies , the law <T_2> with <T_4> .
<T_5> the <T_6> part was <T_4> we <T_2> to , what are <T_0> going to work on in <T_1> week <T_3> ?
<T_3> when <T_2> were about to <T_7> , <T_8> parents <T_6> , &quot; hey , by the way , just before <T_1> leave , if <T_0> &apos;re interested , <T_5> &apos;re for <T_4> . &quot;
<T_1> post-crisis <T_0> is 2020 .
the <T_1> could be middle-aged , <T_0> be as young as <T_2> .
and so , it &apos;s <T_0> very <T_1> , and <T_4> think , historic and <T_2> community to be involved <T_3> .
so i &apos;ll just show <T_1> an <T_3> -- so <T_4> people <T_2> the room , it activates <T_0> object .
thank you .
in all <T_7> cases , <T_6> leaders were willing <T_3> able to make peace , the <T_1> community stood ready to help them negotiate <T_2> implement <T_4> agreement , <T_0> the <T_8> have lived up to the promise that they <T_9> on the day <T_5> were agreed .
<T_2> can &apos;t even <T_0> yourself <T_1> the mirror .
we &apos;re sort of circumventing <T_0> programs that guide <T_1> behavior .
i mean , gene -- <T_0> god for <T_1> .
very <T_0> .
<T_4> one of the <T_5> things about being an arthropod is <T_0> you have to <T_7> . and <T_2> three months <T_8> so these animals molt , and <T_9> build a new <T_6> and <T_1> &apos;s <T_3> problem .
<T_9> &apos;d <T_8> to talk about <T_7> way of thinking about <T_5> trends that i call my &quot; <T_3> unified <T_1> of predicting the future , &quot; but <T_6> &apos;s <T_4> to a <T_0> unified theory <T_2> predicting the future .
and <T_1> anew every <T_2> to <T_0> hours .
palm is <T_0> , especially <T_2> the old <T_1> , <T_3> about this .
it &apos;s just , you know , it was just so <T_3> , <T_4> to <T_0> -- this is <T_1> mother <T_2> the background there .
<T_2> &apos;re just a <T_5> , another form of life . <T_3> they &apos;re <T_1> , and i say this out <T_6> affection <T_0> them .
now , <T_3> at the end of the day , <T_0> &apos;ve objected , <T_1> &apos;ve questioned , <T_6> &apos;ve <T_2> all sorts of counter-considerations , <T_8> in every <T_5> you &apos;ve responded <T_7> my <T_4> .
but <T_1> didn &apos;t even <T_2> down <T_0> animal .
<T_2> becomes an <T_4> of &quot; the sopranos . &quot; hobbes &apos; solution , the &quot; leviathan , &quot; was that if <T_7> for the legitimate use <T_9> violence was vested in <T_1> single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce <T_6> temptation of <T_0> , because <T_5> kind of aggression will be punished , leaving its profitability as zero . that would remove the temptation to <T_3> preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you <T_8> .
we <T_0> look at <T_1> the data .
so you <T_1> be <T_0> , <T_5> why <T_3> it <T_2> that i know <T_4> entertains people ?
<T_1> &apos;s your name ? <T_2> are you <T_0> ?
now this <T_1> different than <T_0> .
as <T_1> see , everything starts to fade <T_0> black , and you <T_3> people going to <T_2> .
<T_0> was abraham path day .
why <T_1> we <T_2> find some other <T_0> to this ?
we &apos;re <T_3> , on top of that , integrating wireless <T_2> into <T_1> affordable <T_4> with <T_0> and <T_5> .
so , for example , when you <T_0> a <T_1> , <T_2> exchange happens .
this <T_2> an opener <T_3> brian eno , and <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> kind of my personal <T_1> of the <T_5> .
but <T_1> object on the right <T_0> made for me <T_2> other <T_3> .
and <T_0> i went to college at <T_6> university of <T_2> , las <T_8> when <T_5> was 18 , <T_4> was stunned to <T_7> that there was not a pop star 101 , or <T_9> a degree <T_1> for that <T_3> .
there &apos;s diatoms made out of <T_0> , and <T_1> &apos;re magnetotactic <T_3> that make <T_4> , single-domain <T_2> used for <T_5> .
describe <T_2> . <T_3> happy <T_1> it make <T_0> ? &quot;
thank <T_0> .
<T_5> the <T_1> around 1980 of p.c. &apos; s , <T_4> spreadsheet programs were tuned <T_0> office workers , not <T_8> replace office workers , <T_3> it respected office workers as <T_6> capable <T_2> being <T_7> .
<T_1> . mazel <T_0> .
even more worrying for the <T_5> , in <T_7> 2008 the holiest of holies , <T_2> it systems of centcom , the <T_6> command managing <T_1> wars in <T_8> and afghanistan , may have <T_0> infiltrated by <T_3> who used <T_4> : plain but <T_9> usb keys .
in the health care <T_2> , if <T_0> touch <T_1> , you &apos;re <T_3> .
<T_0> can <T_1> the text .
<T_6> is the number of distinct <T_8> that have helped us digitize at least <T_4> word out of <T_1> book through <T_2> 750 <T_5> , which is a <T_0> over 10 percent of <T_3> world &apos;s population , <T_9> helped us digitize <T_7> knowledge .
<T_1> are <T_0> .
<T_3> don &apos;t <T_2> notice the <T_1> medium that is wrapping <T_0> up .
but , <T_1> if <T_0> &apos;re <T_2> ?
so that what <T_5> could <T_3> do was go into the <T_0> and write messages <T_4> the person who was <T_2> in that room , which was <T_1> .
<T_1> by the <T_2> , <T_0> &apos;s continued to .
<T_4> i go , &quot; you <T_3> , <T_5> don &apos;t <T_6> go on the <T_2> , and maybe we <T_0> see ... like on <T_1> . &quot;
<T_2> best of <T_5> , <T_0> were able , in <T_1> last <T_4> years , to invent drug treatments <T_3> psychological treatments .
martin <T_6> talks about <T_1> -- as a <T_5> of study and as it works one-on-one <T_7> each patient and each <T_9> . as it <T_4> beyond a focus <T_0> disease , what <T_3> modern <T_8> help us to <T_2> ?
<T_3> &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing <T_0> the bottom <T_1> at <T_2> moment .
so , it <T_2> this <T_1> of weird , <T_0> accident .
in a cruel <T_7> , <T_3> we had almost <T_1> smallpox -- and <T_0> is what you must learn <T_5> a social <T_2> , the <T_6> of the <T_4> inch .
it seems that <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> just <T_3> person who <T_0> that <T_4> problems are <T_5> .
<T_1> even this <T_0> not a fair representation of africa , <T_7> it &apos;s an <T_3> , <T_4> &apos;s <T_2> average speed of <T_6> in <T_5> .
now <T_4> you look at <T_8> , <T_6> &apos;s many <T_3> like dna <T_1> antibodies and <T_0> and <T_5> that you &apos;ve <T_2> about that are <T_7> nano-structured .
so <T_0> first question <T_1> , why do we <T_3> to <T_4> worry <T_5> a pandemic <T_2> ?
so what they <T_0> run is <T_2> and quite literally <T_1> franchise business .
&quot; <T_0> &quot; is the <T_3> translation <T_2> &quot; <T_1> &quot; .
<T_0> popcorn is illustrating <T_1> key thing in <T_2> .
<T_0> want to know what <T_1> business model is on a <T_4> of per-unit basis , or <T_6> the <T_3> product that <T_5> &apos;re <T_2> .
the <T_4> of retaining <T_3> rule of law <T_2> to <T_6> the <T_0> to the <T_5> and kind of <T_1> power .
<T_1> you <T_2> see certain <T_3> that come up again <T_0> again .
but that &apos;s , i <T_0> , <T_5> this is all <T_6> , <T_2> that <T_1> individuals have these <T_3> and <T_4> .
but <T_4> sound <T_2> too <T_1> for <T_3> of us <T_0> ever hear .
they can actually also move <T_2> the light . <T_0> have to <T_3> choose your <T_1> .
<T_8> &apos;s a similar <T_1> for my <T_6> , where switching <T_0> the dvd players , the stereos <T_7> <T_4> computer peripherals that were on all the time , and <T_9> switching them on <T_2> i <T_5> them , knocked another <T_3> off my electricity bills too .
<T_9> is the <T_3> of diplomacy , of <T_4> the solution <T_1> devise as diplomats <T_6> they cannot be <T_2> and understood by also <T_7> broader forces <T_5> societies that we now <T_0> loosely call <T_8> ?
<T_4> -- <T_0> -- -- <T_3> &apos;s <T_5> solar seed . it &apos;s <T_1> concept <T_2> new architecture .
obama <T_0> to <T_1> .
<T_3> ! all right ! most of <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> . <T_2> &apos;s <T_0> .
so <T_1> &apos;s <T_9> of like you having <T_8> job <T_3> chicago , and <T_4> you get transferred to st. <T_2> , and your <T_0> is <T_5> happy about this because <T_7> &apos;ve got <T_6> pay airfare , because you &apos;re gone longer .
but <T_0> very careful <T_3> these projections such as the <T_2> sachs <T_4> as though that <T_1> you an <T_6> picture of power <T_7> in <T_5> century .
they have grown their <T_1> but <T_0> much more .
<T_0> march down <T_4> cleaned up after <T_5> every day by regular janitors , <T_3> i <T_2> have the decency to <T_1> their names .
<T_2> has personal <T_1> that <T_0> would give my left leg to have in my head .
after all , <T_7> didn &apos;t stop <T_1> groundwater as a matter of <T_3> , <T_8> employing 10-year-olds as a matter <T_6> course , <T_2> because executives woke up <T_0> day and <T_4> it was the right <T_5> to <T_9> .
<T_1> then you <T_2> to add some more <T_3> , <T_0> more .
that &apos;s <T_9> -- flies , <T_6> people , have <T_7> , and <T_2> acts <T_4> their <T_3> and on their synapses <T_1> the same dopamine receptor molecules <T_5> you <T_8> i <T_0> .
the <T_0> step <T_1> pattern <T_2> .
<T_3> at least , they <T_7> &apos;t <T_4> they &apos;re interested in <T_2> . <T_0> -- <T_1> not the way any <T_6> being speaks <T_5> .
<T_2> &apos;ve since abandoned that <T_1> , <T_0> goodness .
but this <T_0> not <T_1> the other way around .
<T_2> i feel <T_0> we have a special <T_4> , which <T_3> value very <T_1> .
<T_4> know , they made <T_5> to <T_2> the <T_0> if <T_3> were <T_1> up in the process .
we <T_2> up here <T_0> the <T_6> , <T_4> for all this high-tech , expensive <T_1> , this is <T_9> the <T_8> way to get in the water -- just <T_5> ! -- <T_3> over the side of the <T_7> .
so she <T_0> it .
thank you .
so we <T_6> to look at <T_9> stirling <T_8> in a <T_1> way , <T_3> it was practical -- <T_0> no <T_5> mattered for <T_2> application the internal combustion <T_7> took off <T_4> weight mattered because you were moving around .
marcus : simple . what do you <T_0> about ?
<T_0> terms <T_9> the <T_5> noise , <T_6> international <T_7> organization of the <T_8> nations has formed a <T_3> whose <T_4> is to establish guidelines for <T_2> , to tell <T_1> industry how you could quiet ships .
the number of people living in countries not their own now comes to <T_7> million , and that &apos;s an almost unimaginable <T_5> , but it means that <T_4> you took <T_2> whole population of canada and the whole population of <T_9> and <T_8> the whole population of australia again and <T_6> whole population of canada again and doubled that number , <T_1> would still have <T_0> people than belong to <T_3> great floating tribe .
and they have <T_0> wonderful <T_1> .
<T_2> most <T_4> for <T_1> here in this <T_3> , a <T_0> was created .
<T_1> on both <T_6> care <T_4> global poverty <T_0> aids , <T_3> on so <T_5> humanitarian <T_9> , liberals and <T_8> are actually natural allies , and at times they <T_2> have worked together to solve these <T_7> .
<T_1> ethiopia do <T_0> ?
<T_0> takes a second , but <T_2> &apos;s a <T_1> .
<T_9> there are things <T_5> towards greater complexity , moving towards <T_7> diversity , <T_6> towards greater <T_0> , sentience , ubiquity and <T_2> important , <T_8> : those very <T_3> things <T_4> also present in <T_1> .
<T_2> let <T_0> just leave you with <T_1> things .
so our <T_6> -- <T_7> i think the research also <T_1> the universities -- are now fixing on these <T_4> to say : how <T_5> we actually -- and this <T_0> sound <T_3> now to you -- <T_2> can <T_8> change <T_9> ?
<T_2> our engineering <T_6> went to work on it , and with <T_1> very <T_4> changes , they <T_3> able to <T_5> the <T_0> of this <T_7> .
some guy &apos;s got that <T_1> a <T_0> -- <T_2> &apos;s this like , <T_3> my <T_4> .
so , in <T_3> , fatty acids made <T_4> boiling <T_5> fat are used as a <T_1> agent , but <T_0> for giving it <T_2> pearl-like effect <T_6>
they <T_0> in the <T_1> megacities of the <T_2> world .
keep in mind that , although it <T_3> as if <T_4> individual is <T_0> to cooperate , what &apos;s really going on is <T_1> kind of <T_5> darwinian <T_2> .
<T_5> i <T_3> quickly <T_1> that , &quot; <T_4> , our <T_2> doesn &apos;t really work <T_0> that . &quot;
so <T_2> my voice <T_5> touch <T_3> , if my actions can <T_1> you , if <T_4> being <T_6> can touch <T_7> , please let <T_0> be .
<T_3> than three-tenths of <T_1> percent <T_4> to transfer to <T_2> more expensive second-line <T_0> .
<T_1> these <T_4> not <T_2> kinds of things that <T_3> is thinking about just <T_5> they go get <T_0> condom .
so <T_6> went there <T_3> build partitions <T_7> all the <T_1> volunteers with paper <T_5> , just a very simple <T_2> out of <T_0> tube frame <T_4> the curtain .
<T_1> were <T_0> empowered .
so we <T_0> careful with that .
you &apos;re <T_3> so <T_1> for this <T_2> that <T_4> live <T_0> today .
i think <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> right , <T_2> this is <T_3> controversial <T_4> .
and <T_2> these <T_1> ever even <T_0> met a victim of their <T_3> ?
on your right <T_0> an eight-year-old .
one nice problem <T_3> , <T_2> do <T_1> do about <T_0> ?
<T_3> turns <T_8> that , <T_7> you have that <T_1> , <T_4> stuff happens , <T_6> you <T_5> los angeles <T_2> know this better than <T_0> .
<T_6> , <T_5> copyright and <T_0> laws run counter <T_2> this notion <T_4> we build on <T_1> work of <T_3> .
you could -- you could <T_4> it ; you could make it <T_1> or something : <T_2> is <T_0> actual <T_3> .
so , if <T_1> remember anything <T_3> this next 18 minutes , remember <T_6> : that the <T_7> that falls <T_5> to your <T_9> , sensory <T_4> , is meaningless , <T_8> it <T_2> mean literally <T_0> .
<T_3> cannot be <T_1> part of wholeness <T_0> still <T_2> whole .
we might say <T_0> recovery <T_4> , <T_3> those <T_1> &apos;t require policy <T_2> .
<T_1> &apos;d like to share with you a little bit <T_0> me playing my <T_2> .
also , while we were at the <T_5> , there was a ritual <T_3> our family : when <T_0> significant had happened for any one of us -- whether <T_4> had just been elected as the president of the pta , or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination , or whether <T_2> had won the jabberwocky contest for <T_8> -- <T_6> ritual at the family was , once the announcement is made , we must take five , ten minutes <T_7> do what we call &quot; make over &quot; that person -- that is , to make a fuss <T_1> the one who had been honored <T_9> some way .
<T_9> reminded <T_1> ancient egyptians <T_3> their <T_4> khepri , who renews the ball of <T_5> sun <T_8> morning , which is how <T_7> dung-rolling <T_2> became that sacred <T_0> on the breastplate <T_6> the pharaoh tutankhamun .
each <T_4> was <T_0> or <T_5> out of <T_6> ball of clay , and it <T_2> the imperfections <T_3> people <T_1> .
who <T_2> i being , <T_1> my children &apos;s <T_3> are <T_0> shining ?
<T_2> are <T_0> dispensers . there &apos;s <T_1> friendly <T_3> .
there is .
you don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
in <T_0> , <T_1> west has lost <T_2> work ethic .
<T_0> worried that &#91; if &#93; <T_2> took my <T_4> off <T_1> wouldn &apos;t be <T_3> anymore .
the next issue <T_5> resolved <T_6> that , if <T_4> percent of head and neck pain is caused <T_9> imbalance , <T_0> other <T_7> percent , <T_8> -- if you set <T_3> aneurysms , brain cancer and <T_1> issues -- is <T_2> circulation .
and <T_1> naturally , <T_2> started <T_0> distance myself .
<T_2> i <T_4> &apos;t realize <T_5> for three <T_0> i &apos;m <T_1> at my desk , and <T_6> &apos;m not <T_3> at all .
profound <T_0> forward !
1994 , <T_4> started <T_3> called cdi , <T_6> took computers <T_1> by corporations , put <T_8> into community <T_7> in <T_2> and created <T_0> like <T_5> .
<T_3> he summoned <T_2> and <T_4> , &quot; can <T_1> train <T_0> 150 grandmothers ? &quot;
<T_9> nanabhay <T_4> &apos;s sitting with <T_8> , <T_3> head of aljazeera.net , he <T_7> me that a 2,500 <T_5> increase of <T_0> our <T_2> from <T_1> parts <T_6> world .
<T_1> luckily <T_3> agreed . and <T_0> theme , in two years , is going to <T_2> &quot; cute pictures of puppies . &quot;
<T_2> newspaper <T_1> it in ? <T_0> book ?
<T_3> if anybody did want to <T_2> that , that &apos;s <T_5> kind of <T_6> we need to be <T_1> about , actually : <T_4> opportunities <T_0> change human <T_7> .
<T_4> new wave <T_3> openness and <T_1> in <T_7> , since <T_2> , more <T_0> two-thirds of <T_6> countries have had multi-party democratic <T_5> .
<T_1> just the <T_0> savings in <T_2> trucks can get to two-thirds .
they all came <T_0> .
so , we <T_6> them all <T_2> so <T_7> go together around <T_4> meaningful <T_5> , integrated <T_0> everything we <T_3> about <T_1> patient .
they <T_0> be consciously <T_3> , <T_1> if you <T_2> the botox .
so , <T_0> we clamor for organic food .
and madhav <T_2> , &quot; why do we <T_1> do it <T_3> <T_0> ?
now , when <T_2> talk about suicide , <T_4> is <T_5> a medical contribution here , because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness : <T_3> , bipolar <T_9> , <T_7> , anorexia , borderline personality . there &apos;s a long list of disorders that <T_8> , and as i mentioned <T_1> , <T_6> early in <T_0> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_2> ability to <T_0> things down , <T_1> language <T_4> our consciousness .
hi .
now gamma imaging <T_3> been around for a long <T_5> to image <T_4> heart , <T_2> it had even <T_1> tried to <T_0> the <T_6> .
<T_1> is <T_7> real secret <T_4> : how to get directed energy <T_3> so you &apos;re sending <T_9> energy of <T_0> nuclear <T_8> -- <T_5> like just a <T_6> , but you &apos;re directing it at <T_2> ship .
<T_3> , these <T_2> lie right <T_0> of <T_1> general emotional palette <T_4> we were <T_5> .
<T_1> , right <T_4> second question is , why <T_0> the sea <T_3> ? all right <T_2>
<T_1> i can <T_0> you -- <T_2> &apos;s totally <T_3> oldenburg .
james <T_6> studies complexity : <T_2> an interconnected <T_8> -- say , a swarm of birds -- is more than the sum of its parts . and <T_4> theory , it turns out , <T_0> reveal a <T_5> about how the economy works . glattfelder shares <T_9> groundbreaking <T_1> of how control flows through the global economy , <T_3> how concentration of power in the hands of a shockingly small number <T_7> us all vulnerable .
<T_2> we &apos;ve been looking at <T_6> idea <T_0> competition as <T_5> way of <T_4> in <T_3> to <T_1> fit together .
however , <T_1> things <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;ve talked <T_0> mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk <T_1> health .
<T_4> was <T_0> the ice , <T_7> over <T_1> stigma , <T_2> i think <T_6> &apos;s also <T_3> design <T_5> do .
this <T_0> art . &quot;
we don &apos;t , however , really <T_1> at a <T_0> level .
<T_1> then <T_5> notice something quite a little bit <T_0> about <T_2> eyes <T_3> the <T_4> .
how <T_1> you can <T_0> , what <T_5> from it , what are the <T_2> , <T_4> are the possibilities , the <T_6> , the <T_3> ?
but <T_1> strength lies <T_2> telling them <T_0> everybody else <T_3> been doing .
<T_8> there &apos;s another <T_0> thing that comes from this realization <T_2> humans have a <T_4> origin in africa , and that is that when <T_1> humans emerged around <T_5> years <T_7> or so , they <T_9> not alone <T_3> the planet <T_6>
<T_5> move our continent <T_3> , to do the <T_2> that need <T_4> that i <T_0> about -- getting <T_6> people <T_1> .
<T_2> this <T_1> forces the seawater <T_0> a membrane .
<T_2> the individual <T_1> instruction , <T_3> percent of the <T_0> are going to be above <T_4> threshold .
<T_3> they did , <T_2> probably was right there <T_0> ground <T_1> .
<T_2> says , well , <T_1> &apos;s the <T_3> , <T_5> are <T_4> , and i &apos;m <T_0> .
and <T_1> truth <T_4> , <T_3> guy <T_2> probably <T_0> this to you .
we &apos;re <T_6> to go . <T_0> we <T_5> is <T_3> check <T_2> nasa headquarters <T_4> cover the <T_1> .
and <T_4> realized <T_3> i had hit upon <T_1> that <T_5> think has this huge <T_2> to change <T_0> world .
and <T_1> becomes this <T_0> .
and <T_9> of that announcement , we got a <T_3> article <T_7> the <T_6> york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and <T_2> deciding <T_8> become ceo of <T_0> company -- whereas <T_1> was just an <T_4> -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up <T_5> .
<T_4> has been <T_3> close <T_1> on all <T_0> visualizations you &apos;re <T_2> .
so <T_1> people <T_2> that these models sound <T_3> and <T_8> , but <T_7> , &quot; <T_6> , <T_4> these really as good <T_5> the <T_0> ? &quot;
<T_2> anticipated <T_0> , even <T_3> those <T_1> were not known .
and <T_0> will start <T_1> world like this .
<T_3> , problem-solving <T_2> so on . it &apos;s <T_1> extraordinary <T_0> .
and <T_3> we take that , <T_4> take <T_7> idea of what culture is doing and add it <T_1> the long-term trajectory -- again , in life &apos;s evolution -- we find that <T_2> case -- each of the major <T_0> in life <T_8> what they &apos;re really about is accelerating and <T_6> the way in which <T_9> happens <T_5>
and <T_7> was <T_5> old <T_2> , <T_3> for fun he turned <T_8> he began to follow it , <T_1> i tell you , i could tell by <T_6> speed at <T_4> he moved on those pad <T_9> that this man was a ph.d.-level <T_0> .
<T_2> &apos;t make it <T_3> . don &apos;t make <T_0> a <T_1> issue .
and <T_1> kill <T_0> .
and to be <T_1> , sometimes i quite <T_2> their <T_0> as well .
now <T_7> used to be <T_6> dangerous <T_1> game , <T_5> you <T_3> knew <T_0> you had given too little <T_2> once something <T_4> happened .
and <T_7> &apos;s <T_9> the case that <T_2> material has washed off the <T_4> of titan through these <T_3> that we saw , <T_8> has drained <T_0> billions <T_5> years to fill <T_1> low-lying <T_6> .
<T_4> lot of <T_3> effort in humanizing <T_0> classroom is <T_1> on student-to-teacher <T_2> .
i <T_4> for your <T_3> to <T_6> and protect <T_0> wild <T_7> in <T_2> that will <T_5> the health and , in so doing , secure <T_1> for <T_8> .
being <T_5> disturbed , she <T_6> for comfort , <T_1> i <T_8> &apos;t really know <T_9> to tell <T_2> , because <T_0> have to deal <T_7> so <T_3> mess in <T_4> society .
it &apos;s going <T_1> be britain &apos;s first ever <T_0> disabled orchestra .
stars <T_1> basically <T_6> machines that self-organize and self-sustain themselves <T_7> <T_3> of <T_2> , <T_4> order <T_0> the entropy <T_5> the world .
<T_1> &apos;s an <T_4> compared <T_0> having <T_2> of them <T_3> . &quot;
<T_1> look upon <T_4> body <T_0> a form of transport <T_2> their <T_3> , don &apos;t they ?
and <T_1> think <T_0> may very well be true , so i &apos;ll <T_2> with this .
<T_0> sister <T_1> with malaria .
i didn &apos;t <T_0> the <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;d <T_3> my neck and my <T_1> in <T_2> places .
this <T_2> a ufo shot from <T_3> house <T_0> altadena , <T_4> , looking down <T_1> pasadena .
so the longer <T_7> i <T_3> , the <T_8> my <T_5> became , <T_0> one <T_6> morning , and <T_4> training , i was hit <T_1> a <T_2> .
<T_6> : now , <T_2> interesting <T_3> about this <T_7> , <T_8> don &apos;t have to <T_4> an engineer <T_0> appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can <T_1> in your <T_5> is so <T_9> .
now <T_8> is one <T_7> that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just <T_9> , spend , <T_2> , we don &apos;t <T_1> , spend some more , and <T_4> of <T_5> is republicans <T_0> it comes <T_3> military <T_6> spending .
not <T_0> , <T_1> . <T_3> which chamomile is very <T_2> .
<T_1> gets to use the <T_0> on <T_2> ? &quot;
&quot; <T_1> why ? &quot; i asked <T_0> .
and <T_2> said to <T_3> , &quot; well <T_1> &apos;s <T_4> point of <T_0> , <T_5> ?
now <T_3> started this <T_4> a point <T_1> view <T_0> has to be something that scales en <T_2>
<T_0> don &apos;t eat <T_2> . <T_1> lunch .
so this <T_2> out to be <T_1> simple to <T_0> .
but what was <T_6> more important <T_1> the fact that <T_4> actually accomplished <T_0> mission . <T_2> japanese government called off <T_5> whaling <T_7> . mission <T_3> .
and <T_2> it turns out , lots and lots of <T_1> wanted to <T_0> me .
i <T_4> to think <T_7> i do a <T_6> physical <T_5> , but because <T_3> whole visit was now <T_0> the physical , <T_2> could do an extraordinarily <T_1> exam .
and <T_4> &apos;s <T_1> whole <T_2> type of <T_0> , which is <T_3> play .
and while <T_2> was struggling to <T_0> out how and <T_1> mantis shrimp , or <T_6> , <T_4> , i started to <T_5> about <T_3> appendages .
<T_7> i said , <T_4> , <T_0> &apos;s <T_9> ; i <T_3> would love to have <T_2> input <T_1> this <T_6> and this <T_5> , and he finally <T_8> to it .
<T_2> &apos;s the <T_4> in which these <T_3> are now doing all <T_0> things , <T_5> changing <T_1> .
in <T_0> u.s. , it &apos;s one in five .
<T_1> interspecies internet ? an <T_2> in <T_0>
in <T_3> five years <T_1> will discover <T_5> like earth , around sun-like <T_7> , <T_4> same distance as <T_0> earth <T_6> the <T_2> .
this <T_1> mountains <T_2> of molehills , <T_3> timeline of <T_0> media panic .
second <T_3> : the <T_4> &apos;s new budget <T_0> renewable energy <T_2> barely a billion <T_1> in <T_5> .
<T_9> don &apos;t you sit down <T_5> kids and give them four items , a red <T_6> , <T_4> blue <T_0> , a kangaroo <T_2> a <T_8> , and have them <T_1> a <T_7> about those four <T_3> ?
<T_0> wish <T_1> could do that <T_2> .
<T_4> known as the <T_2> of foreign <T_0> , <T_5> state <T_3> information office is responsible for <T_1> of china &apos;s external publicity <T_6> .
and so this <T_7> , <T_9> looks <T_5> a big <T_4> to you , is actually <T_6> thing that got <T_2> really <T_3> about this and <T_8> me feel like <T_0> were on the <T_1> track .
and of <T_7> , we don &apos;t do <T_1> experiments <T_8> humans , but just <T_3> coincidence , my <T_6> has shown that <T_5> who have low sperm count , low semen <T_0> have significantly <T_2> atrazine in their <T_4> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_1> fundamental <T_0> that we &apos;re all <T_2> .
because <T_5> you think <T_4> it , 1,000 <T_1> , <T_3> &apos;s <T_2> 1,000 <T_0> worth spreading .
<T_0> : <T_1> .
<T_0> barcelona , <T_2> las ramblas <T_6> some film <T_1> , i did <T_4> hollywood sign going and coming , <T_5> a <T_7> out of it , and <T_3> built <T_8> .
what &apos;s new <T_2> that <T_0> process has <T_4> taken days or <T_1> of <T_3> .
there <T_5> not <T_2> in china , but <T_4> in <T_6> united states <T_0> are <T_1> very small , <T_3> but bad <T_7> .
you go <T_1> a museum and <T_0> take really <T_2> care of <T_3> .
<T_0> minutes .
<T_3> , <T_1> quickly , what <T_2> the <T_0> time profile ?
<T_2> went to <T_5> local <T_3> , i <T_0> to buy <T_4> a <T_1> pad packet .
we <T_1> to make the best <T_0> models <T_2> can , <T_3> most consistent <T_4> .
so <T_0> summarize , <T_1> we could <T_4> a top quality education to <T_6> around <T_5> world for free , <T_2> would that <T_7> ? <T_3> things .
a <T_3> years ago <T_4> had a <T_0> called rang <T_2> basanti , <T_8> suddenly <T_6> thousands of young <T_5> wanting to <T_7> for <T_1> change .
<T_1> just said , &quot; i &apos;ll call you <T_2> i get <T_0> . &quot;
it <T_1> like <T_0> average high school cafeteria <T_3> your average town in <T_2> .
and so every time <T_1> desire to <T_0> with the <T_7> , which <T_5> at least <T_4> ubiquitous <T_2> that <T_6> : &quot; do not feed the <T_3> . &quot;
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen <T_4> these storms , this electrical firing , and see <T_9> you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave <T_0> brain and reach the <T_2> or the arms of <T_5> animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these <T_3> , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it <T_1> digital commands and send it <T_8> an artificial device <T_6> will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in <T_7> time .
a thousand years <T_0> this <T_1> , we abandon <T_4> hunting <T_3> gathering <T_2> .
<T_4> what &apos;s really <T_1> about it -- well , actually , this all <T_3> like nano-artwork , but it <T_5> out <T_2> nano-artwork is just what you <T_0> to make nano-circuits .
so <T_3> thought i would <T_1> by <T_5> you just <T_2> couple of the take-aways , the bigger <T_0> that i <T_4> from my year .
countless <T_7> of <T_1> natural moments , not <T_0> moments , are <T_6> there , <T_5> we &apos;re starting to learn <T_2> to <T_4> them and <T_3> them .
<T_2> need deep-diving subs , new <T_3> to <T_0> the <T_1> .
that &apos;s <T_2> distance <T_1> us <T_0> andromeda , right ?
these <T_2> , these <T_0> , represent governance <T_1> .
so let me <T_0> a few examples <T_1> .
so <T_0> &apos;t put it <T_1> .
<T_1> can <T_0> into <T_3> of people &apos;s <T_2> . &quot;
<T_3> would <T_2> say we <T_0> to be <T_1> smartest ?
local <T_4> on the <T_2> would get together and whole <T_7> of <T_8> , 20 <T_5> would <T_0> across the united states <T_3> and <T_6> <T_1> form companies .
and my father <T_0> a soldier , <T_4> my <T_2> was a fisherman and <T_1> a <T_3> .
<T_2> the guy <T_0> shot it <T_5> has <T_4> strong eye <T_1> some experience with video <T_3> .
ninety-five percent of <T_0> professors report <T_2> they are above-average <T_1> .
so <T_2> actually threw a <T_1> quiz here onto <T_0> .
<T_2> would <T_3> use this example <T_0> all <T_1> ? &quot;
but <T_0> aren &apos;t the <T_1> threat we face .
so <T_3> a daf-2 <T_4> -- you <T_2> that i have <T_0> x drawn here through <T_1> receptor .
and <T_3> i was thinking about <T_9> it might be great if i could <T_7> take all these <T_8> -- like all these <T_0> of my thoughts <T_5> my <T_6> -- if <T_2> could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form <T_1> i could share them with <T_4> else .
<T_3> &apos;s a <T_1> article <T_2> an <T_0> election race that &apos;s happening .
<T_1> we <T_2> &apos;t <T_3> each other &apos;s <T_4> . i find that <T_0> astonishing .
or <T_1> gable , or whoever <T_0> .
<T_1> there is <T_5> word that <T_3> your <T_6> life , <T_4> that <T_0> is &quot; <T_2> . &quot;
<T_2> it was <T_3> to do <T_6> when i was <T_0> with <T_5> bifida and my <T_1> and <T_4> weren &apos;t working .
<T_3> there are <T_2> that <T_6> self-infertile . that means they <T_0> &apos;t -- <T_5> pollen in <T_1> bloom can &apos;t fertilize <T_4> .
<T_4> here <T_2> had the <T_7> that <T_1> inserting <T_3> natural <T_6> , if you want -- <T_5> fog -- i could make the space <T_0> .
and if <T_0> look closely , <T_1> &apos;ll see duping <T_2> throughout this <T_3> .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the <T_0> in <T_1> .
but once <T_2> occurs , <T_0> can <T_1> exponentially .
and <T_9> religious police <T_4> the supposed <T_6> way of life on every <T_2> , <T_1> force -- like women are <T_3> to cover <T_0> heads -- <T_8> the <T_7> , the <T_5> head cover .
<T_9> a <T_1> grows in the <T_3> and gives <T_0> oxygen and <T_5> up carbon dioxide , and it <T_2> and it falls to the forest <T_6> , it <T_8> that carbon dioxide back <T_7> the atmosphere <T_4> into the ground .
<T_1> you <T_0> do extremely <T_2> .
that <T_0> dangerous .
now <T_4> &apos;s a <T_0> car for <T_2> 20-something year-old kid <T_1> st. <T_3> .
<T_5> just formed a biotechnology <T_3> that is using <T_0> sort of an approach to develop <T_7> for alzheimer &apos;s <T_4> other diseases <T_8> aging , <T_6> we &apos;re making <T_1> real <T_2> .
now , one bit of <T_1> before we get <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_1> right , <T_3> &apos;m going to get on my <T_0> and do <T_2> .
<T_3> is the one <T_1> gift <T_5> may <T_0> if you suffer <T_4> any existential <T_2> .
and the <T_2> why that &apos;s happening <T_7> that , <T_0> now , in <T_4> -- the technology <T_8> we are using -- a <T_5> is <T_1> enough <T_3> several electrons <T_9> flow through the channel simultaneously , <T_6> by side .
<T_2> the case of <T_1> indus script , the <T_0> is the reverse .
and of <T_1> , <T_4> can <T_5> , <T_6> humble <T_3> it was <T_2> same thing multiplied by a <T_0> .
so therefore , if we were to do <T_2> , what we &apos;d need to do is sequence that <T_6> in all <T_7> different <T_4> and <T_0> if it &apos;s the same or if it &apos;s different . so if <T_5> is the same , this indicates <T_8> that site is important <T_1> a <T_3> , so a disease mutation should fall within <T_9> site .
i <T_4> &apos;t really <T_5> it , <T_1> don &apos;t pay attention to it until <T_0> &apos;s , you know , <T_2> a <T_6> that &apos;s dead on the <T_3> .
they said , &quot; well , we <T_6> believe that <T_0> you &apos;re a mormon <T_5> if you &apos;re in <T_9> standing with <T_7> church , when you <T_3> you get to go <T_4> heaven <T_1> be with <T_2> family for all <T_8> . &quot;

it &apos;s <T_0> very <T_1> .
<T_1> it &apos;s <T_6> of cool <T_2> me to be <T_5> of a family <T_0> a <T_4> where he was talking about that in <T_3> .
<T_2> we were flying <T_1> the <T_0> and india <T_4> was nice <T_3> .

now , visual thinking <T_1> a <T_0> asset <T_2> my <T_3> designing cattle-handling <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;re the <T_0> technologists .
and the <T_1> are going to be much <T_0> and <T_3> ups <T_4> going to be much <T_2> .
and <T_3> do that , you have to actually go back <T_7> a <T_6> before <T_4> , in <T_0> early &apos; 80s , and <T_1> at it from the perspective of a <T_5> <T_2> .
we <T_0> around flags , and <T_2> we can <T_1> each other .
then i <T_0> telling my <T_2> , &quot; i don &apos;t see <T_3> . can <T_1> paint it ? &quot;

and <T_5> father <T_1> , &quot; i &apos;m <T_0> sorry . <T_4> , it &apos;s <T_3> , <T_2> lied .
<T_0> you <T_1> about what is going to kill <T_2> ?
i <T_2> , <T_3> how happy <T_0> people <T_1> , and good-looking <T_4> .

<T_2> first thing <T_1> actually <T_3> with them <T_0> this .
and so what <T_0> &apos;d suggest <T_3> what <T_1> call independent <T_2> authorities .
and so <T_6> makes you <T_3> , <T_1> would happen if <T_0> hadn &apos;t tasted <T_2> fruit of knowledge , so to speak , <T_5> what kind of morality would <T_4> have ?

yeah .
they &apos;re in really good shape to <T_0> what we &apos;re going to want <T_1> .

<T_3> was filmed <T_0> a <T_1> using a gyro-stabilized <T_2> .

<T_1> then another thing <T_2> , <T_0> close <T_3> .
<T_4> talked about it a little <T_0> oxford two years <T_2> , and <T_7> of <T_9> visited <T_3> to <T_1> manufacturing , which is one of <T_8> great , real companies <T_6> east <T_5> .

<T_1> have to be a <T_3> husband <T_2> i was , <T_5> that &apos;s how you make <T_6> . &quot; and now <T_0> began to make <T_4> .
over time , <T_3> do <T_0> you pay <T_5> to do . <T_4> if <T_1> judge how <T_7> they &apos;re going to get paid on <T_6> capital that they &apos;ve invested , <T_2> on the short-term returns , you &apos;re going to get short-term <T_8> .
<T_6> have 1.5 <T_4> enrollments , <T_1> million quizzes <T_2> the 15 <T_3> that have launched so <T_5> have been submitted , and 14 million <T_0> have been viewed .
and this process , <T_8> just a <T_3> or so , <T_1> thousands of times <T_2> minute in <T_6> one of your <T_5> billion cells <T_9> as long as you <T_4> and <T_7> and <T_0> .
<T_5> i <T_4> that as <T_6> look at culture , we <T_0> of come to <T_2> how <T_3> got to where we <T_1> .
but <T_1> , i &apos;m feeling <T_0> right now .
and i think <T_1> &apos;s <T_2> a <T_0> thing .
<T_5> then you can send it <T_3> the kinko &apos;s <T_9> at the corner <T_1> go get <T_0> chair . now , <T_8> implications of this <T_2> enormous , not only <T_4> the participation of the final buyer in the design process , but <T_7> no tracking , no warehousing , <T_6> wasted materials .
when <T_6> get a hankering <T_7> some <T_1> , we actually allowed <T_3> a way out into <T_2> little smaller <T_4> where they <T_5> enter the <T_0> .
i <T_2> thought <T_0> was <T_1> .
<T_4> have art <T_0> getting together , <T_1> old <T_5> parts <T_2> doing an iron-pour to make something <T_3> out of it .
<T_5> could have that kind of immersive <T_1> of being <T_3> -- of feeling <T_4> you &apos;re <T_6> -- <T_0> what &apos;s going <T_2> .
we &apos;re understanding <T_1> software programs that <T_0> our <T_2> run .
<T_4> that builds <T_3> on the <T_5> -- and <T_7> &apos;s what that image on the <T_2> is -- gradually <T_6> encrusted <T_1> the calcium <T_0> .
look : u.s. aid , helping people <T_2> not <T_1> , <T_4> there <T_3> been books <T_0> have criticized u.s. aid .
<T_2> tend <T_1> get <T_0> differently than men do .
survey <T_0> survey , from <T_2> research to <T_8> annenberg <T_6> for <T_9> policy , has found that daily <T_3> viewers are <T_4> informed about current <T_7> than the <T_1> of all major <T_5> and cable news shows .
<T_5> &apos;s <T_2> research functions <T_3> poor societies -- you <T_0> really <T_1> with <T_4> people .
you &apos;ve <T_2> gravity , you &apos;ve got the <T_1> force , you &apos;ve got <T_0> fluid <T_3> .
that <T_1> is called a <T_0> .
<T_0> really , where <T_1> those <T_2> going to get released to ?
now it took <T_6> two <T_1> of processing on intel &apos;s highest-end servers to <T_2> this happen , and <T_8> six <T_7> of human <T_9> computing <T_4> to make <T_0> of <T_5> of that <T_3> .
<T_1> : a <T_4> walked <T_0> the <T_3> , <T_2> where we &apos;d been .
<T_2> he &apos;s looking at something really , truly <T_5> , <T_0> is bottles <T_4> evian water <T_3> the <T_1> .
if <T_2> do more in <T_7> kind of a <T_6> way , <T_4> simplicity <T_0> complex and , <T_5> fact , we can keep on doing <T_1> for a <T_3> long time .
<T_1> was talking <T_3> this amazing , three-year-old australopithecine <T_2> , <T_0> .
you know , this <T_0> a <T_1> point in the respect for <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;s very <T_1> , because <T_3> central <T_5> doesn &apos;t need to even <T_4> the public <T_0> .
<T_8> &apos;ve made incredible advances in technology in recent years , but <T_1> often it seems <T_7> certain fortunate people <T_2> benefit . engineer krista donaldson introduces the remotion knee , <T_4> prosthetic device for above-knee amputees , many of whom earn less <T_9> $ 4 a day . the design <T_0> best-in-class technology <T_3> yet is far <T_5> than other prosthetics <T_6> the market .
<T_2> that very idea , i <T_0> , <T_7> terror <T_5> many <T_4> , <T_6> anger , or <T_3> of one sort <T_1> another .
<T_5> are <T_7> now in the <T_6> oreo of existence -- <T_2> at least life on <T_3> earth -- following <T_1> first <T_0> microbial <T_4> .
<T_6> is <T_1> thing . there <T_2> homework bans springing up all over the developed world in <T_0> which had been piling on the homework <T_4> years , <T_5> now they &apos;re <T_8> that <T_3> can be <T_7> .
and <T_1> is responsible <T_2> this <T_0> .
&quot; <T_0> you <T_1> here we &apos;ll explain <T_3> . &quot; <T_5> , <T_4> , <T_2> .
<T_3> is <T_1> we have a <T_2> hard time thinking in <T_0> terms .
i &apos;m not <T_0> you &apos;d <T_1> it .
of course <T_2> are , they <T_1> a <T_0> nation .
<T_0> long-term affectionate <T_8> bonds that <T_2> throughout <T_4> long childhood with <T_1> mother , with the <T_7> and <T_6> , and which <T_3> last through a lifetime , which <T_5> be up <T_9> 60 years .
they <T_0> stand <T_1> and groom <T_2> .
now , <T_2> , <T_3> been found <T_0> it can <T_1> a lot .
<T_1> was <T_4> a preliminary <T_5> judge had <T_2> listen to , <T_0> bind mr. <T_3> over to stand trial for a first-degree <T_6> .
necessity <T_1> the <T_0> of <T_2> .
<T_0> normal is <T_1> average .
<T_0> here believes <T_1> &apos;re <T_2> the bottom <T_3> percent ?
<T_1> use three-dimensional imagining analysis , <T_0> we actually <T_2> these biomaterials by <T_3> .
that <T_2> a <T_0> point for the <T_5> , where <T_3> started looking at it as a <T_6> for <T_4> and <T_1> .
<T_2> was taken <T_1> the cassini <T_0> probe .
<T_0> &apos;s <T_6> little bit of a <T_2> story , <T_4> health aspect <T_5> light , than <T_1> i &apos;m telling you <T_3> .
and <T_0> in here .
but yet again i <T_6> . and <T_4> i may <T_5> , i <T_2> him once , and <T_3> was weak , or <T_7> , or <T_1> or <T_0> or <T_8> .
so as <T_8> make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth , or with <T_5> other , these <T_4> literally produce sounds <T_9> drop <T_0> of thin <T_7> -- basically taking what &apos;s often <T_1> , kind of , unseen space , or this undetected space , and making <T_2> something real , that <T_3> then can appreciate and become <T_6> with .
with no <T_2> , <T_3> tower is like <T_0> 45-story <T_1> .
&quot; spanish chef <T_2> ... &quot; -- <T_0> the <T_1> accused <T_3> .
and <T_5> you want to <T_0> in shelter for 48 <T_1> 72 hours <T_2> , but you &apos;re going to <T_7> hopefully -- you &apos;ll have your little wind-up , battery-less radio , and you &apos;ll be <T_6> for <T_3> to <T_9> you when it &apos;s safe to go <T_8> . that &apos;s what you need to <T_4> .
right , are <T_3> ready ? <T_2> &apos;m going to <T_1> you <T_5> for a <T_4> , very <T_0> moment .
<T_4> what is <T_6> to me so much right <T_1> is that <T_3> combining cutting-edge <T_0> -- <T_2> , <T_5> -- with <T_8> age-old poetry , we are moving closer <T_9> understanding our <T_7> humanity .
<T_6> imagine what <T_2> means for <T_4> , <T_3> family , <T_5> friends , your <T_0> financial <T_1> .
but <T_5> want you to <T_4> me <T_3> i use these <T_2> because <T_7> &apos;m talking <T_6> anything that you <T_8> to spend <T_0> time <T_1> do .
but <T_2> you <T_3> at this <T_1> at night , it looks <T_0> this .
so <T_6> developers <T_7> , <T_2> this is <T_1> . okay , so if we have <T_4> conventional <T_0> , we have a fixed <T_5> , maybe we can put in 14 <T_3> .
<T_3> , <T_2> first thing we need is , <T_1> need <T_0> .
the <T_2> of uncovering the <T_3> food waste scandal started <T_0> me <T_4> i was 15 <T_1> old .
marcus : a modern day <T_0> .
<T_1> after the <T_2> crash , authorities literally wanted <T_4> cover up <T_3> train , <T_0> the train .
and , again , <T_2> eu standard-size , real <T_4> , so <T_3> get some sense <T_0> the <T_1> .
we can either go on bringing out or emphasizing <T_6> dogmatic <T_1> intolerant <T_2> of our faith , <T_3> we <T_5> go back to the rabbis . rabbi hillel , the older contemporary of jesus , who , when <T_7> by a pagan to <T_4> up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on <T_8> leg , said , &quot; that which <T_0> hateful to you , do not do to <T_9> neighbor .
<T_4> , <T_2> is crucial because <T_1> fuel cost of your engine over its <T_0> dwarfs <T_3> cost of <T_5> engine .
boy : no , <T_1> you <T_2> around <T_0> a <T_3> all day .
so <T_0> &apos;s just run through <T_1> guys .
<T_6> artificial <T_0> , <T_5> only have <T_3> not created artificial <T_1> , <T_4> haven &apos;t yet created artificial <T_2> .
if we <T_0> look on what <T_3> , <T_1> see , temperature &apos;s <T_2> high .

<T_5> socialism <T_1> they <T_7> was <T_2> peculiar <T_8> of swiss-bank socialism , which allowed the <T_4> of states and <T_9> ministers to rape and <T_0> africa &apos;s treasuries <T_3> deposit <T_6> switzerland .
they coded <T_1> in the thickness <T_2> gray <T_5> in <T_4> parts of the <T_8> using a false <T_9> scheme , in which no <T_7> is coded as purple , <T_0> any <T_3> other than purple indicates a statistically significant <T_6> .

<T_7> when <T_4> see all these <T_6> and complex things , which i also <T_1> , in visual <T_3> , i <T_9> whether everyone sees things like this , <T_8> whether <T_5> like cave art <T_0> ornamental art may have been derived from them <T_2> bit .
so <T_1> triggered <T_2> extraordinary <T_0> in cross-border crime ?
so <T_3> you can <T_0> , we <T_5> fine uses a <T_2> that i <T_1> &quot; passive <T_4> . &quot;
<T_6> &apos;s not a <T_0> ; it &apos;s <T_5> whale , animals as <T_3> as <T_1> still swimming <T_4> out there in our <T_2> .
here <T_2> took the object <T_5> of its <T_4> , <T_6> baxter didn &apos;t go and try to put it <T_1> ; it <T_7> back <T_3> realized <T_0> get another one . <T_8>
swami dayananda <T_2> unravels the <T_4> paths of personal development <T_5> attaining true compassion . <T_7> walks us <T_0> each <T_3> of self-realization , <T_9> helpless infancy to the <T_8> act of <T_6> for <T_1> .
<T_0> yet , <T_1> listened to them .
<T_9> the one that &apos;s really been sort of <T_7> me <T_1> , <T_4> i <T_5> &apos;t been able to <T_6> out , is this <T_0> &quot; <T_2> a <T_3> , <T_8> . &quot;
because <T_0> are <T_2> of a <T_1> level .
so , <T_0> instance , we can plot <T_2> length of the <T_1> .
you &apos;ll find <T_4> own <T_1> to <T_3> , to <T_0> , to <T_2> .
<T_3> &apos;s something <T_4> anime music <T_0> , <T_5> example , taking anime captured <T_1> television re-edited to <T_2> tracks .
if you want to put something on <T_0> web <T_9> are three rules : first thing is that <T_7> http names -- <T_6> things that <T_8> with &quot; <T_4> : &quot; -- we &apos;re using them <T_2> just <T_3> documents now , we &apos;re using them for <T_5> that the <T_1> are about .
<T_3> yourself , if you can , <T_0> &apos;re a <T_4> woman in <T_2> , you &apos;re going <T_1> the <T_5> .
<T_5> the <T_2> is <T_3> earth -- <T_1> same <T_4> that we &apos;re <T_0> to <T_6> our problems in .
and also , my <T_3> does a <T_0> around the <T_5> , and <T_1> happily never see another <T_2> comedy as <T_4> as he lives .
<T_2> know <T_0> at all , whatsoever , about <T_1> .
actually , those action video game players have <T_4> other <T_6> in terms of <T_3> , <T_8> one aspect <T_2> attention which is <T_1> improved for the <T_9> is <T_7> ability to track objects around <T_0> the <T_5> .
<T_7> cause <T_1> problems , such as the <T_4> of <T_0> , <T_3> pollution of natural <T_5> , and the <T_2> of available <T_6> space .
<T_0> mom hates <T_1> picture .
so <T_2> the very beginning <T_1> started <T_0> talking to <T_3> .
everybody <T_0> that .
so the crux of it <T_9> down to this <T_3> of decision-making -- giving <T_2> to people in a form that doesn &apos;t <T_6> educate them <T_1> inform them , <T_4> actually <T_0> them <T_5> make better decisions , <T_8> choices in <T_7> lives .
the idea is that <T_1> soars on <T_2> lift over <T_4> body , <T_5> a <T_0> on a <T_3> .
<T_3> , i found <T_0> jobs in <T_1> for <T_2> .
but <T_1> , <T_0> superstar effect is happening across the <T_2> economy .
there <T_3> many <T_4> lands , <T_2> on your <T_5> in <T_0> , <T_1> on your stage of life .
<T_5> &apos;s the <T_3> of about 900 <T_0> removed <T_2> the <T_1> in <T_4> year .
but isn &apos;t <T_1> strange <T_3> little <T_2> all over <T_4> world <T_0> fast bikes ?
<T_2> i <T_1> knew <T_3> hard they worked all <T_0> .
<T_5> think <T_6> &apos;re <T_7> stored in <T_1> skin , and we think <T_3> sunlight <T_2> this where <T_4> has generally <T_0> effects .
and they <T_5> feed that information back to <T_0> subscribers , <T_3> only to their <T_6> on <T_7> same <T_4> located <T_2> the <T_1> jam !
<T_4> : so <T_2> &apos;m going to start <T_0> up . i <T_1> it <T_3> .
so this isn &apos;t <T_3> at all , but <T_0> &apos;s <T_1> ongoing <T_4> where <T_2> can continue to <T_5> .
<T_0> there are <T_1> others .
<T_0> &apos;ve been experiencing <T_2> identity crisis since <T_1> end of <T_3> cold war .

<T_5> &apos;s kind of an <T_6> story <T_2> you <T_9> that <T_7> is twice as <T_3> as homicide <T_4> actually more common as a source of death <T_0> traffic fatalities <T_1> this <T_8> .
within <T_2> week , i received <T_0> call <T_5> earthlink that said , <T_4> to a <T_1> cents <T_8> megabyte <T_3> charge , <T_7> owed <T_6> 30,000 dollars .
just using <T_0> checklist requires you <T_4> embrace different <T_2> from <T_3> ones we &apos;ve had , like <T_1> , <T_6> , <T_5> .
and <T_5> they placed me <T_0> it , and the <T_4> got <T_2> of it . my <T_1> decided they wanted me to <T_3> it .
and <T_2> the <T_0> said the <T_6> day -- i could <T_3> to <T_5> : <T_1> &apos;re <T_4> sure .
<T_2> was working , i was going everyday to <T_1> for <T_0> homeless .
i <T_1> never seen black <T_0> before .
i &apos;ve felt <T_0> way <T_2> certain <T_3> , at <T_1> times .
people <T_0> mentally and <T_1> .
<T_2> there are times you might <T_0> to do something <T_1> .
not <T_1> the world <T_0> us , but we , <T_2> .
<T_1> have <T_0> fancy <T_2> for this : we call it <T_3> sensing .
i mean , anybody who &apos;s thought <T_3> computers at all can see that <T_6> &apos;s <T_7> , because <T_2> is defined as <T_5> manipulation , <T_9> thought of as <T_8> as <T_1> , but <T_4> symbols will <T_0> .
<T_1> now -- i <T_2> ask , <T_0> do <T_3> put myself <T_4> this position ?
<T_6> just <T_1> years , their ratio went from <T_0> worker for <T_4> 30,000 <T_5> to <T_2> worker for every 2,500 <T_3> .
<T_4> actually , it &apos;s a <T_2> problem , <T_0> how can <T_3> ever see <T_1> ?
this <T_3> mobile <T_0> . <T_2> are very <T_1> at that .
<T_3> that &apos;s what we would normally <T_2> in <T_0> usual process of <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;re at a big <T_0> in hospitals .
difficult , <T_0> ? <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> .
thank you .
if you read <T_5> books now , a <T_2> is somebody who <T_6> foster creativity , who can get his -- get <T_9> employees -- <T_4> , i <T_1> say &quot; <T_0> &quot; -- who can get <T_3> employees to talk to each other , who can <T_7> build teams and get them to be <T_8> .
he &apos;s <T_3> , the guy &apos;s <T_0> , <T_2> he &apos;s got <T_4> little <T_1> .
<T_4> the <T_1> news was <T_0> the institution , <T_2> banking institution , <T_3> .
<T_1> nothing <T_0> at all .
so <T_3> , just <T_0> amazing <T_4> , slowed down <T_2> , <T_1> extremely slow speeds .
<T_8> leading into <T_1> 2006 , we &apos;d run through all the <T_4> from foster &apos;s , we &apos;d run through all <T_6> money i had , and <T_0> we <T_2> no money left , and we &apos;d convinced all our <T_5> -- creative agencies , web development agencies , hosting companies , <T_9> -- to delay <T_7> billing <T_3> december .
<T_1> herd explodes <T_0> it gathers <T_2> .
<T_1> that &apos;s <T_0> a <T_2> agglutinate .
<T_1> you put <T_3> all together in one <T_4> , it &apos;d be <T_0> size of <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;ve run <T_7> phase two trial in <T_4> on , <T_8> , <T_6> patients -- patients <T_0> have received standard <T_3> and <T_5> cancer has come <T_1> .
<T_3> &apos;s <T_0> traditional <T_4> of the way of <T_5> , and we <T_1> be <T_2> to carry on doing it .
that <T_4> billion <T_6> down to <T_0> dollars and 49 <T_1> -- that &apos;s <T_2> the <T_5> allocates for <T_3> .
your <T_2> and family will be gathered in the <T_5> , <T_8> there , <T_4> your gravesite <T_7> be a tombstone , and inscribed on <T_9> tombstone , it will say , &quot; <T_1> lies <T_6> distinguished <T_0> who invented <T_3> . &quot;
<T_4> &apos;s one of <T_1> great <T_2> tragedies <T_0> we remember , even <T_3> .
and <T_1> uses 100 times <T_3> water <T_0> most vegetables <T_2> .
<T_4> didn &apos;t know <T_5> to do <T_3> my <T_8> , <T_7> i <T_2> told <T_6> you <T_1> passion , <T_0> &apos;s going to work out .
<T_0> china alone , 300 million <T_6> , <T_5> say <T_2> million people , will move to the <T_4> over <T_1> next 15 <T_3> .
<T_2> actually , <T_1> i &apos;ve been finding is <T_0> different from that .
so <T_2> have <T_0> of <T_1> .
<T_1> &apos;s the way to <T_0> this .
and <T_3> of <T_1> take <T_2> tests <T_0> year .
and <T_3> people walked into <T_0> room , they would see themselves <T_2> the <T_7> , <T_4> with <T_9> difference : <T_6> person was <T_5> invisible <T_1> they moved in the <T_8> .
we &apos;re not <T_6> good at <T_3> in general . italians <T_2> great <T_4> , <T_5> it &apos;s <T_0> very <T_1> , generally .
there &apos;s water in <T_2> the skull <T_0> the <T_1> .
and <T_2> decided that <T_0> was going to set out to <T_3> to <T_1> this <T_4> .
so , this is what sristi is <T_1> : &quot; give <T_0> a place to stand , <T_3> i will move <T_2> world . &quot;
and <T_0> are they reading <T_1> ? &quot;
she was <T_0> .
<T_9> , <T_0> is about -- and this is <T_1> gets <T_3> to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity -- synesthesia <T_4> eight times more common among artists , <T_6> , <T_8> and other creative <T_2> than <T_5> the <T_7> population .
the one i want to show you -- after <T_0> get them to <T_6> the <T_1> , <T_3> have a night <T_5> we show the movies <T_2> the <T_4> .
my <T_3> had been <T_2> a catastrophic <T_1> accident , and <T_0> died .
<T_9> you start to hear <T_4> abusive <T_6> , but <T_7> don &apos;t hear one <T_2> voice , you <T_5> about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive <T_0> , <T_8> if <T_1> devil had tourette &apos;s , that &apos;s what it <T_3> sound like .
let &apos;s find out .
so <T_1> do <T_2> make <T_0> actually work ?
<T_4> i <T_0> say , <T_1> think this is <T_2> rather modest <T_3> .
we think we can <T_1> personalize <T_0> .
they <T_4> our <T_2> and change <T_1> emotions and <T_3> who <T_0> are as <T_5> .
so , <T_1> see <T_2> imagery , of course , not stopping at the <T_0> .
<T_0> they <T_2> , &quot; well you <T_3> dig . &quot; <T_4> we <T_6> to <T_5> up , instead of <T_1> down .
and then <T_1> &apos;s dan <T_0> .
so <T_4> &apos;re at <T_5> earliest <T_2> of discovery about basic <T_3> , components <T_1> life on <T_0> planet .
<T_1> did <T_0> ct scan .
<T_1> is , then , how <T_0> &apos;re presented .
and i &apos;m saying , &quot; humans <T_3> now going to be the <T_2> senses of <T_0> machine , &quot; in a <T_1> sense .
the <T_9> to this <T_4> astonished me , <T_3> as the <T_1> of the home <T_5> proudly led me <T_2> this apartment , <T_8> floor <T_6> ceiling , <T_7> part was <T_0> .
you <T_2> see <T_3> , hiv , <T_0> , <T_1> .
<T_3> it basically <T_1> the <T_5> of people who indicated <T_2> would be interested <T_0> giving their <T_4> to <T_6> .
<T_1> we can have a <T_0> .
but what was credible , <T_1> is biological and scientific <T_7> , <T_6> that we <T_4> stem from <T_8> -- in fact , <T_9> a <T_0> called <T_2> eve <T_5> lived 160,000 <T_3> ago .
<T_0> librarians in the <T_3> would <T_5> things <T_4> answer for the executives , &quot; <T_1> are the names of <T_2> &apos;s <T_6> ? &quot;
<T_3> can <T_1> to unpack the <T_0> involved because of the <T_2> .
<T_3> is <T_0> they think <T_2> my site ; <T_5> &apos;s <T_1> by blog <T_4> .
<T_1> the thing about being autistic <T_0> , i had to <T_3> social <T_2> like being in a <T_4> .
if <T_6> watch closely <T_0> if <T_9> watch closely , <T_4> may have seen <T_5> of the <T_2> , <T_3> also you may have seen <T_8> jazz music is <T_1> with <T_7> .
<T_1> the only <T_8> you can solve these <T_6> -- and <T_9> is <T_7> many greatest challenges are coming in this <T_3> -- is through cooperation , through working together , which <T_0> that soft <T_2> becomes more important , that ability to <T_4> networks to deal with these <T_5> of problems and to be able to get cooperation .
<T_1> have to develop <T_0> gluten .
<T_1> a new inhabitant moves <T_2> the tower , <T_0> already have a <T_5> over <T_9> head , <T_6> they <T_7> typically <T_4> their space with <T_3> few curtains or <T_8> .
<T_4> does it , it turns out , with the <T_3> denticles <T_9> you had <T_2> speedo bathing suits , that <T_1> all <T_0> records in the <T_8> , <T_5> it &apos;s <T_6> particular kind of <T_7> .
so he <T_0> a cost-free <T_1> .
the first thing <T_1> do is lock <T_6> a <T_4> body position -- <T_7> down in <T_5> chest , your <T_2> extended , put <T_3> your <T_0> parachute .
<T_4> of them , from <T_0> , <T_3> the <T_2> of human <T_1> .
she <T_1> health care <T_0> me .
<T_3> every single <T_1> , <T_2> answer is &quot; <T_0> depends . &quot;
<T_2> of them said a <T_1> is house-sitting for his <T_0> .
<T_1> telecommuting ? what <T_0> ?
<T_3> these <T_4> , i <T_1> , <T_5> they were in <T_2> u.s. , they <T_0> be actually here in this <T_6> .
it &apos;s got to be <T_0> .
these <T_3> believe <T_0> the indus script represents <T_4> ancient <T_7> of the <T_2> language family , <T_6> is the language family spoken <T_5> much of south <T_1> today .
<T_2> steffen : the <T_0> to a <T_1> future
<T_1> &apos;s about reasserting <T_0> firsthand experience <T_2> present time .
and , ultimately , the <T_0> problem <T_1> &apos;t going to go away .
<T_1> think <T_2> human race <T_3> &apos;t have a future if <T_4> doesn &apos;t go <T_0> space .
we <T_7> to <T_3> in <T_8> solutions : <T_5> for <T_2> , precision <T_6> , <T_4> crop varieties , drip irrigation , gray water recycling , <T_1> tillage practices , <T_0> diets .
then after we harvest a <T_4> , we <T_3> this ratio , <T_1> now <T_2> can see , those <T_0> match perfectly .
there &apos;s this one trial <T_0> ran many <T_2> after <T_1> ii .
<T_6> you ask <T_1> kind <T_2> a situation is <T_7> to people becoming <T_3> and <T_5> , the <T_0> answer is <T_4> non-zero-sum situation .
so i <T_2> come in and i can do things , and just treat this <T_0> as <T_3> lump of <T_1> .
<T_9> when i <T_0> the <T_6> in the press <T_5> at the <T_7> awards that they &apos;d better install <T_4> phone lines <T_8> internet <T_1> , <T_2> didn &apos;t know what <T_3> was talking about .
<T_2> type <T_1> extension pole -- like <T_3> the <T_0> use .
what they didn &apos;t <T_2> us is <T_1> some <T_6> than others , <T_3> that plants <T_4> whole grains <T_5> be supplanting <T_0> junk food .
<T_4> then , what <T_0> of the earth would be <T_1> equilibrium <T_6> could continue on , and be for <T_2> , <T_5> , <T_3> ?
<T_4> decisions <T_3> cannot <T_1> , you <T_2> think , you <T_0> feel .
<T_1> so people form <T_0> .
it was a little <T_1> , <T_2> you <T_4> , <T_0> was <T_3> .
and <T_0> , anuj took <T_5> entrepreneurial risk <T_4> in <T_2> to <T_8> a public <T_1> that <T_3> purchased by <T_6> aid establishment <T_7> work with malaria .
see , i <T_5> also <T_0> child actor , <T_4> doubled up the layers of <T_3> performance of <T_6> identity , because <T_7> one knew <T_9> i was <T_2> a <T_1> really playing <T_8> boy .
and <T_2> &apos;s the <T_5> version of a <T_4> for <T_0> new <T_3> that <T_1> &apos;ll <T_6> you in a bit .
less than three <T_2> of <T_0> very <T_1> audience .
<T_6> : aimee <T_1> i <T_0> we &apos;d <T_3> talk a little bit , and i wanted <T_2> to tell <T_7> of you what makes <T_4> a distinctive <T_5> .
i &apos;ve <T_0> it said <T_4> the most dangerous <T_1> on the <T_3> is the <T_2> male .
<T_1> was <T_0> amazing sort of insight for <T_2> .
<T_0> department stores are <T_1> ; <T_3> &apos;re <T_2> built .
<T_1> then thirdly , making <T_0> persistent .
<T_5> we <T_4> . and <T_3> said , &quot; <T_0> . <T_2> we &apos;re <T_1> connected . &quot;
and <T_1> said it <T_0> impossible .
so how <T_0> you <T_1> little ?
raghava <T_0> : shake <T_2> your <T_1>
<T_0> looks <T_6> this : <T_2> that float <T_5> the <T_7> , project <T_1> foot up , <T_3> foot <T_4> .
<T_0> of the <T_2> we find <T_1> .
<T_3> we were doing so for thousands of years , whether it &apos;s when we <T_9> in <T_4> , or <T_0> in <T_2> , before this big system <T_6> hyper-consumption came along and <T_1> built these <T_8> and <T_5> out own <T_7> fiefdoms .
the thing <T_7> we see <T_6> the kind of moore &apos;s <T_2> trend that &apos;s driving <T_5> in our <T_1> to <T_0> the environmental <T_4> is <T_3> materials .
<T_1> name was sandor <T_0> .
<T_3> tried to <T_5> him , <T_2> i realized it is <T_0> difficult <T_4> make <T_1> mistakes . &quot;
<T_0> , <T_2> are in a much <T_1> situation .
<T_4> idea that <T_2> &apos;d like you <T_1> consider , for <T_6> , <T_0> to take <T_3> look at <T_5> it departments .
and <T_4> &apos;d like <T_1> to think <T_5> every <T_2> of more complex play builds <T_6> this <T_3> for <T_0> humans .
<T_1> of this is happening <T_0> firing a shot .
<T_4> : <T_3> is drawn <T_1> for <T_2> draw weight , which means more <T_0> .
<T_2> even <T_1> we <T_4> able to find online <T_0> , quite often <T_5> is no <T_3> .
two <T_2> years ago <T_1> lake <T_6> , <T_3> erectus , <T_0> of our <T_5> ancestors , actually lived <T_4> this <T_7> .
<T_6> &apos;m reporting back . i &apos;m reporting <T_4> simply <T_1> say that <T_8> i left the children &apos;s home i <T_5> two things <T_7> i <T_9> to do . one was to find <T_2> family , and the <T_3> was <T_0> write poetry .
<T_2> turned 31 <T_0> week , <T_1> is there .
<T_0> all-powerful folks <T_1> &apos;t need checklists .
all of these things could <T_3> be done , <T_0> i will tell <T_1> i &apos;d pretty much bet that it <T_2> be done .
<T_2> clearly , from the <T_1> , we are doing our <T_0> to change <T_4> image , <T_3> it &apos;s exploding .
<T_1> are filling gaps <T_0> governments <T_2> &apos;t afford <T_3> fill .
<T_2> where <T_1> we go <T_0> ?
<T_3> i started saddleback <T_2> , <T_0> was 25 <T_1> old .
<T_2> there &apos;s <T_5> celebrity interview , <T_3> it &apos;s more <T_4> who &apos;s asking the question <T_1> who <T_0> .
so you <T_0> a <T_2> worker <T_1> your encrypted vote .
<T_2> &apos;ll <T_3> you how <T_0> the lever is : the lever <T_1> that big .
<T_1> , there are <T_0> major mass <T_2> over <T_5> last <T_4> million years , called <T_3> big five .
and <T_0> stage <T_2> , we take it to <T_1> oven .
1933 , vera <T_1> found , when <T_2> was <T_3> by others , it felt <T_0> in the mind .
<T_4> &apos;s a <T_1> of little things involved in making <T_7> rocket that it <T_0> actually <T_6> , <T_5> after <T_3> have the <T_2> .
<T_2> &apos;ve been on <T_1> journey , a return <T_3> , <T_0> 13.7 <T_4> years .
kh : <T_2> . <T_4> you . <T_5> job . <T_1> : <T_3> you . <T_0> you .
and <T_2> didn &apos;t ask them <T_1> do <T_0> cartoons .
<T_1> of course , <T_6> &apos;s very <T_2> if you <T_5> to know what the population <T_4> is and <T_0> status of <T_3> animals .
<T_2> turn up the volume <T_6> a little <T_9> -- i &apos;m talking <T_1> a little <T_8> 80 <T_7> -- <T_5> all of a sudden the <T_3> begins to <T_0> signals you <T_4> .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_3> air conditioning left <T_2> the base , but <T_4> skin now moves <T_0> hydraulics .
the <T_0> of wellington <T_1> there , you know , get out the machine , obviously demonstrates <T_4> , and <T_7> gets it . she &apos;s the only <T_3> in his lifetime , really , <T_5> said , &quot; <T_8> understand what <T_2> does , and i understand <T_9> future of this <T_6> . &quot;
number <T_0> : always use <T_1> control .
so <T_3> thought is , hey , maybe what we should do is <T_9> immediately -- we hear <T_7> is <T_2> spreading from <T_4> to <T_0> , <T_5> virus has mutated <T_1> be a human-to-human transmitter -- <T_8> &apos;s shut down the <T_6> .
i <T_6> managed <T_1> do it by chewing more coca leaves in <T_2> day <T_0> anyone in <T_4> 4,000-year <T_3> of the <T_5> .
<T_2> woman shoots her <T_3> . <T_0> woman shoots her <T_1> .
<T_2> is no different than the <T_0> are to the <T_3> in the <T_1> .
<T_0> &apos;ve <T_4> a <T_1> about <T_2> they can <T_3> can &apos;t do .
hypersonic <T_2> is exactly the <T_0> : <T_3> &apos;s 100 <T_1> based on non-linearity .
there is more that we &apos;re doing <T_2> explore this idea <T_1> collective <T_3> , that i , as a citizen , <T_8> i share the <T_7> with whatever device that i have , could <T_5> you about what is <T_6> , and that <T_4> you do the same , we can have <T_0> bigger picture <T_9> what &apos;s going on .
the ted <T_3> will <T_2> me , <T_0> perhaps there &apos;s <T_4> for one <T_1> .

and <T_3> , <T_0> percent <T_4> the world &apos;s gdp today is <T_2> that <T_7> industry <T_1> call service , the service <T_6> , the <T_5> i &apos;m in .
<T_1> : <T_0> .
i think <T_1> has <T_0> simple solution too . i &apos;m going to give it to you .
at the end of <T_2> christmas <T_0> 13 countries had seen <T_1> .
everyone <T_0> your <T_1> thing .
it &apos;s in your hands and <T_0> hands and those of <T_1> children .
<T_0> right . <T_3> . <T_2> we show <T_4> video of the <T_1> ?
<T_2> were yelling at <T_1> , they were -- it got to be <T_0> ugly .
<T_3> go , &quot; <T_7> &apos;re the <T_0> , <T_1> should <T_5> . &quot; <T_6> goes , &quot; no , <T_2> just <T_4> , sir . &quot;
and i <T_0> , <T_5> a <T_4> metaphor , isn &apos;t it ? an <T_3> president who has to <T_1> without smudging <T_2> ink .
i mean who <T_0> put themselves through <T_1> ?
<T_1> here is <T_2> we <T_0> meet .
<T_6> was afraid that <T_0> would kill us , <T_8> instead they understood , especially when i told them <T_9> i was trying to apply the <T_4> stratagem that philip johnson <T_2> in 1934 when he wanted to make people understand the importance <T_7> design , and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and <T_1> the moma <T_3> he put them on white pedestals against white <T_5> , as if they were brancusi sculptures .
all of these innovations <T_0> contribute <T_1> fraction of <T_8> we contribute by <T_6> in a <T_4> neighborhood three <T_3> from <T_2> metro in the <T_7> of a <T_5> .
speaking at a london girls &apos; school , michelle obama makes a passionate , personal case <T_2> each student to take education <T_5> . it is <T_8> new , <T_4> generation , <T_7> says , that will close the gap <T_3> the <T_9> as <T_0> is and the world <T_1> it should <T_6> .
and these <T_1> use sticks <T_3> the <T_4> to <T_5> insects and <T_2> out of <T_0> of wood .
<T_1> thought <T_0> should <T_4> kept and triceratops <T_5> out , <T_3> that &apos;s <T_2> going to happen .
<T_3> , <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> a <T_0> , really , important set of concepts .
<T_2> , <T_3> , <T_1> made all the decisions all <T_0> .
<T_0> need for animal <T_1> is going to <T_2> .
but they get <T_2> in the <T_7> of their <T_5> , and <T_9> &apos;s very important because <T_1> think glasses , in addition to helping people see , is also <T_0> fashion <T_4> , <T_8> they &apos;re <T_3> to <T_6> for it .
and <T_4> them <T_6> in the <T_7> is <T_2> notion of <T_0> , <T_5> has to be there , if <T_3> like , at <T_1> very roots .
you &apos;ll find <T_0> inside of you .
now , <T_4> like in an <T_8> , <T_6> britain especially , to talk about <T_3> comparison <T_0> foxhunting , which is something <T_7> was banned after a <T_5> struggle , by the <T_2> not very many <T_1> ago .
well , i <T_2> &apos;t <T_3> it &apos;s either . <T_0> think <T_1> can be <T_4> .
or , are you going to tell <T_0> this ?
that mineral has killed a <T_7> : five millions of <T_3> have gone because of this colombo-tantalite -- they call it <T_2> -- that they use <T_1> to make cell <T_8> and <T_9> has been <T_6> that area , all over <T_0> congo . <T_5> , and good , big business of the <T_4> .
so it &apos;s overall performance <T_0> efficiency <T_1> exceeds <T_2> products .
<T_1> goes , &quot; what <T_0> dogs ? &quot;
and you <T_9> , <T_6> we go to <T_0> and as life <T_8> , <T_3> as life <T_5> evolves , <T_2> kind of have to look at it <T_7> -- step back for <T_1> moment , and re-address <T_4> balance .
<T_1> think that &apos;s the most <T_3> thing that people <T_0> , is <T_2> .
<T_0> basically we <T_4> hay and crab <T_2> and made barbecue <T_1> out of <T_3> two <T_5> .
in 1918 , a new <T_0> appeared <T_2> killed some <T_4> to <T_1> million <T_3> .
<T_2> there <T_4> socio-economic <T_1> , which are <T_3> being solved at <T_0> much better scale .
<T_3> , <T_1> &apos;s got <T_0> do with <T_2> brain .
<T_1> what we &apos;re trying to <T_4> , <T_3> rna -- which is <T_7> readout from our <T_5> -- <T_8> very <T_6> , and so <T_0> have to move very <T_2> .
<T_4> when <T_6> military are telling <T_2> that this is a <T_0> that cannot be <T_1> by <T_3> might alone , <T_5> we <T_7> listen .
and the <T_3> with <T_4> &quot; @ &quot; sign that <T_2> acquired <T_0> few <T_1> ago .
<T_2> somehow or another , in <T_1> last couple <T_4> decades , the <T_3> of the free <T_5> become a <T_0> minefield .
and expressions <T_0> compassion are also found <T_1> our international <T_2> .
and <T_1> said , &quot; because <T_2> one knows <T_0> had anything to <T_3> with it . &quot;
and <T_0> would look at <T_1> instrument <T_3> in the front <T_2> .
<T_5> fact , <T_3> the past <T_2> decades , <T_9> market reasoning <T_6> market thinking have gathered force <T_4> gained prestige , <T_0> public discourse <T_1> this <T_8> empty of larger <T_7> meaning .
<T_3> we went <T_2> and we looked <T_0> wikipedia , we found <T_1> map .
this is absurd .
the <T_0> is <T_2> , <T_3> implicated , <T_1> .
<T_9> , if <T_2> turn up the <T_7> too much , i &apos;m having an <T_4> on <T_6> pressure , which <T_0> during the making of that sine <T_5> , <T_1> speed <T_8> which it is <T_3> is shifting .
<T_0> that &apos;s what <T_2> mean by <T_3> unified <T_1> .
turns out <T_2> builders not <T_4> loved the <T_5> more , <T_3> thought that <T_0> would see the world <T_6> their <T_1> .
i later <T_1> i was also <T_3> of <T_2> , possibly congenitally , in the upper <T_0> .
the story <T_0> in the iran-iraq war <T_1> that <T_4> of events that <T_3> in the invasion <T_2> iraq by <T_7> forces , the <T_9> of a <T_6> ruler <T_5> instant regime <T_8> .
this <T_0> our <T_1> of <T_2> .
and , in <T_2> case , it was a <T_3> undertaking to <T_4> a <T_7> , and to come to <T_9> a <T_0> system that , for all of human <T_6> , had been <T_1> , and <T_8> humans had <T_5> touched it .
<T_3> because gravitationally attracting <T_2> is embedded in this <T_4> , it tends to slow down the expansion <T_0> the space , <T_1> .
i <T_8> it &apos;s <T_4> in that <T_9> facility , i think , is <T_7> the only <T_0> i can think of these days where <T_5> , literally , every country in <T_6> world -- <T_3> we have <T_2> from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that &apos;s both long term , sustainable <T_1> positive .
<T_1> a <T_4> , i &apos;m always interested in <T_3> that <T_2> elements <T_0> illusion .
<T_3> was <T_1> in a prison with <T_2> nothing , <T_5> material goods , but he had a sense of his own <T_7> journey , which <T_9> believe we are <T_6> born into . he <T_8> , &quot; <T_4> i can &apos;t do <T_0> .
<T_5> 2006 , <T_1> qatari students took me <T_0> go <T_4> see <T_3> migrant <T_2> .
and <T_5> say <T_3> as a <T_2> who has eaten <T_1> fair share of <T_0> beef in <T_4> life .
now before <T_5> get up in <T_0> , or you <T_4> into <T_7> , <T_6> you pick a <T_1> color , i want to <T_3> what <T_2> mean by revolution .
of course , <T_2> microprocessors <T_1> then a very <T_3> breakthrough -- <T_0> algorithms .
<T_6> i hope <T_5> tarter &apos;s wish to engage <T_9> includes <T_7> and <T_4> and other sea <T_3> in <T_2> quest <T_0> find intelligent <T_8> elsewhere in <T_1> universe .
<T_1> &apos;ll give <T_2> a <T_0> of seconds .
it also <T_0> sense in <T_2> strong <T_1> .
and <T_0> data is <T_1> clear .
it has shrunk because our <T_1> enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller <T_4> of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular <T_2> of the material world , and <T_8> granular understanding has <T_5> reams of data <T_7> our <T_9> can <T_6> longer <T_3> and for which <T_0> need more and more complicated computers .
<T_3> &apos;m actually <T_0> even <T_1> if this is -- this <T_2> be <T_4> .
<T_1> lxd : in <T_0> internet age , dance evolves ...
and <T_3> remote <T_7> -- i first went there <T_0> a <T_9> ; i &apos;ve been back several times <T_6> filming , most recently <T_8> untamed americas -- it &apos;s the altiplano <T_2> the high andes of south america , and <T_5> &apos;s the <T_4> otherworldly place i <T_1> .
but it <T_0> also <T_3> largest <T_2> that had <T_1> been built .
<T_1> is a graduate <T_0> at <T_2> .
<T_2> also heard <T_1> language : &quot; that <T_0> . &quot;
i <T_1> &apos;t have that much <T_0> to <T_3> , <T_2> they turned out <T_4> well .
and <T_2> started to realize the <T_4> of little <T_3> that go right every <T_8> , that <T_0> didn &apos;t even <T_5> , <T_7> i took for <T_9> , as opposed to focusing on the <T_1> or four <T_6> went wrong .
so , if <T_2> &apos;re in the <T_6> today , or <T_3> you &apos;re watching <T_1> talk in some other time or place , you <T_0> a participant <T_5> the digital rights <T_4> .
so i <T_3> to see <T_5> world <T_0> a <T_1> new <T_4> and <T_2> became obsessed with this .
his <T_1> was <T_0> poor .
thank you .
<T_0> think that <T_2> -- the most <T_5> to <T_3> was that <T_1> writing was actually <T_4> good .
<T_2> you had gotten <T_1> , this <T_0> would have been a <T_3> more <T_4> . &quot;
instead of <T_0> percent <T_1> yes , <T_3> percent said <T_2> .
<T_2> it <T_6> essential <T_0> us to be a <T_7> in <T_3> sphere , of course to <T_5> our standing and <T_4> leadership <T_1> the world .
<T_0> u.n. was established in <T_1> .
so where <T_5> that leave the <T_1> of us as a family <T_4> our three <T_3> boys in the <T_0> of <T_2> this ?
and they <T_1> together <T_0> people in <T_2> movies now <T_3> owning <T_4> .
<T_1> when i saw <T_0> , i <T_2> really <T_4> , <T_3> it <T_5> lifelike .
and <T_4> found <T_6> fascinating <T_1> the <T_2> responsibility team was not formed <T_3> part of some <T_5> corporate <T_0> .
so <T_5> do <T_3> both <T_6> they <T_1> power sort of <T_2> , and <T_0> when they &apos;re feeling <T_4> in the moment .
and <T_4> i didn &apos;t <T_3> get happy <T_5> 1960 , because then <T_0> found out , basically , you know , that <T_2> are three <T_1> of <T_6> .
so , let <T_1> present the <T_8> to you : if our benchmark for americanness is <T_9> , you should ask <T_0> , how <T_4> do you eat <T_5> , versus <T_7> often <T_6> you eat <T_2> food . <T_3> ?
so what we <T_6> is that <T_4> neuron <T_0> whenever the <T_1> has gone into one <T_5> place <T_3> its <T_2> .
whereas if we <T_4> building <T_3> demand on the ground on a civilizational <T_8> , rather than merely on <T_7> political <T_5> , a <T_0> above politics -- <T_6> that <T_9> not <T_2> parties , <T_1> are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture .
<T_7> &apos;re still <T_1> usable . they <T_6> be &quot; re-commissioned , &quot; but the way they <T_8> things , which is <T_2> complicated , we <T_0> we have <T_4> a <T_3> of the nuclear weapons we had <T_5> .
it &apos;s 40,000 <T_3> to <T_1> the university <T_2> pittsburgh <T_0> school .
<T_1> early can <T_0> rock performance <T_2> ?
the <T_5> of <T_2> are <T_4> high , <T_3> it certainly won &apos;t <T_0> if <T_6> don &apos;t <T_7> to make <T_1> happen .
and so <T_3> lined up , <T_0> the <T_9> in <T_1> row , and the guy <T_4> birthday it <T_7> filled up the <T_5> , <T_2> he went <T_8> and started <T_6> people .
i <T_1> &apos;t very <T_0> at reading <T_2> .
do <T_4> canned demo , or <T_0> something that lets <T_3> know <T_5> people <T_2> going to buy whatever <T_1> is .
<T_2> he says , &quot; what <T_0> you do with <T_1> other <T_3> ? &quot;
<T_8> , <T_9> any <T_1> or <T_2> from her <T_6> brother at all , suddenly <T_5> disappeared off of the top of <T_4> bunk bed <T_0> landed with this <T_7> on <T_3> floor .
we <T_1> our <T_0> to work too .
<T_6> are some of <T_2> businesses : <T_8> , <T_7> , vegetables , trees , fruits , and <T_9> is <T_1> interesting -- nike ice cream <T_5> nike biscuits ; <T_4> is <T_3> village sponsored <T_0> nike .
<T_1> brin + larry <T_0> : the genesis of <T_2>
and now <T_3> at <T_0> second <T_1> of <T_2> .
and <T_0> &apos;s <T_4> ... &quot; and <T_2> went through all <T_1> we <T_3> out <T_5> .
would <T_3> make us <T_2> responsible for <T_0> is <T_1> today ?
<T_0> moller : my dream of a flying <T_1>
they <T_2> not , and <T_1> cannot , imagine how <T_0> could really deal with this <T_3> .
<T_4> love to <T_3> , and <T_0> has become <T_1> of my <T_2> cities .
<T_0> . <T_2> we &apos;re going north , very <T_1> north .
on <T_0> ground , it &apos;s powered <T_1> .
<T_1> , basically <T_0> east was swallowed <T_2> the west .
<T_1> &apos;s <T_4> only <T_2> that &apos;s been around long <T_0> to have a chance <T_5> making <T_3> claim .
now <T_3> , among our <T_0> , <T_2> had <T_4> comparable information , and <T_1> had not .
<T_0> no , <T_2> were <T_1> accurate .
and so <T_0> once <T_2> cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational <T_3> , <T_1> operations would resume .
good .
<T_3> says to <T_4> , it was <T_1> afternoon and somebody <T_5> to go <T_2> the <T_0> .
<T_1> became <T_2> . we now know <T_0> today from <T_3> ice caps .
but <T_1> was where it started getting <T_0> enjoyable .
so the <T_2> &apos;s <T_1> is <T_0> .
but <T_0> it &apos;s something <T_2> than <T_6> , <T_4> their water <T_1> changes , <T_5> don &apos;t have many <T_3> .
<T_1> &apos;s actually <T_2> massive <T_0> .
i &apos;m <T_0> , &quot; <T_2> , <T_1> . <T_4> , <T_3> . &quot;
<T_2> india there is <T_0> rape <T_1> three minutes .
and <T_5> &apos;s <T_2> little clock <T_0> the <T_6> left-hand <T_7> , so you can see the <T_1> is <T_3> two minutes <T_4> this .
so i <T_0> do this .
so that &apos;s for <T_0> .
this <T_2> another project <T_0> worked on <T_3> sensible cities <T_1> and currentcity.org .
there are <T_0> of <T_1> innovators <T_2> fantastic projects .
<T_2> &apos;s about <T_1> million such <T_0> .
<T_1> that &apos;s <T_2> we &apos;re limited to , at the <T_0> .
<T_3> , right ? well , <T_2> have <T_0> problems in <T_1> .
and so <T_4> you <T_0> to convince them to do something <T_2> don &apos;t want <T_3> do , it &apos;s <T_1> difficult .
what <T_1> the <T_2> now with the <T_0> here .
if <T_2> sank , it <T_1> be a whole different <T_0> as <T_3> as an oil spill .
and <T_4> you throw in <T_0> durable goods <T_5> automobiles <T_3> so forth , that <T_2> well more than <T_1> .
<T_4> instance , <T_2> percent in the <T_3> in <T_0> your <T_6> know each <T_5> is attributable to <T_1> genes .
you <T_0> elephants , <T_1> , <T_2> , pigs , etc .
<T_0> to the ocean <T_1> health for <T_2> .
