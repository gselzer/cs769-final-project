Note [this slightly older paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.304.pdf) from the same authors - their preprocessing pipeline seems similar ([code](https://github.com/aliaraabi/OptTransformer))

[Moses](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder), used for "unctuation normalization, tokenization, data cleaning, and true-
casing" (but [this site](http://www.statmt.org/moses/))

[CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) ([paper](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)), used to create constituency trees for the training sentences.
